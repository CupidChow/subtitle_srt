1
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Congratulations, congratulations!

2
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,680
Boss Wang, Boss Wang.

3
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
Long time no see.

4
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,480
Thank you, thank you.

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,120
Please, have a seat inside.

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,520
Alright, alright.

7
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,240
Please, come inside.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,520
Okay, alright.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,320
Congratulations, Boss Liu!

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
Please take a seat in the
private room upstairs.

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Let's go, upstairs.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
Okay.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,080
Congratulations to you, Qi Ye.

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
So impressive, isn't it?

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,080
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,080
Just being here is enough.

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,440
Your daughter is beautiful too.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,080
Good, good.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
Boss He.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
Boss Lin, Boss Lin.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,000
Excuse me, excuse me.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,240
Take it easy.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,720
Qi Ye.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Congratulations!

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Thank you, same to you!

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,000
Boss Lin.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,040
Congratulations to you.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,760
Boss Lin.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,520
Excuse me, excuse me.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,440
Please, have a seat.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Boss He.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Boss He.

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Qi Ye, long time no see.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Congratulations to you.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
May your fortune be as vast
as the Eastern Sea.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you, Boss He,
for honoring us today.

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
And this is...

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
This is Haitang.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,840
The famous one in Beijing,

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,760
the Peking Opera star
everyone wants to see.

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,200
Boss Haitang.

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Haitang.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
Go greet Qi Ye now.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,960
Haitang greets Qi Ye.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
Wishing Qi Ye a long life
like the Southern Mountain.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
Not at all.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Qi Ye.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
Has Duan Jiu Ye arrived?

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,520
Not yet.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Are you looking for him?

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,360
Today is Qi Ye's big day.

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
We're all here to honor him.

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
Not at all, you flatter me.

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,640
Please, Boss He and Boss Haitang,

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,400
this way to the private room.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
He—Boss He, Boss He.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Private room, this way.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,640
Qi Ye.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Congratulations to you.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Wishing you fortune
as vast as the Eastern Sea.

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
And you are...?

62
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,920
Look over here.

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
Fortune as the Eastern Sea,
life as the Southern Mountain.

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,160
Old Jiu.

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Weren't you in Beiping?

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
Depends on whose birthday it is.

67
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
Where do I sit?

68
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Upstairs, private room.

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Please, Jiu'er, let's go.

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,880
Come on, come on.

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,240
Eunhee.

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,880
Look at this pillar.

73
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
It's made of golden sandalwood.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,040
Look.

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Haiyue.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,040
Look.

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,680
That man over there—

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,880
That's Boss Fu from
the biggest firm, Pinghetang.

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I've asked around.

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,040
He just bought a batch
of top-quality big ginseng.

81
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
Follow me in a bit.

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's get them together.

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
This flowerpot—

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,680
It's clearly an antique.

85
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,040
No.

86
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,040
Sis.

87
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,600
Sis.

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,600
Can you be a little more ambitious?

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't know why Dad let you

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
become the leader.

91
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,160
The young lady has arrived!

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
Everyone, make way!

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Hurry up, Ruyi!

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
We've been waiting for you.

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,880
Is it starting soon?

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,960
Why are you dressed like that?

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Quick, get her changed.

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
As long as we're not late,
it's fine.

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,880
Hurry, let's go.

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,320
Let's go.

101
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
Ruyi, why are you so late?

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,240
Yang Tingxuan.

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,880
Let me tell you—

104
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
Tingxuan smells like alcohol.

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
What's up with your brother?

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Sorry.

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Brother Tingxuan, long time no see.

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,600
Come, Ruyi.

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Young Master Lin, sorry.

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,520
We’re late.

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
No need to say that, Miss Yang.

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,960
You’re an honored guest.

113
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,680
Guests of honor always arrive last.

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,040
My father is unwell today.

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,760
So he couldn’t come to celebrate Uncle Lin’s birthday.

116
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,240
Sorry.

117
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,800
I’m here today to wish Uncle Lin a happy birthday.

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,200
I brought a six-leaf ginseng I dug up myself.

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Wishing Uncle Lin a long, healthy life.

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Ruyi.

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,360
You’re amazing.

122
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,640
This is too valuable.

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,640
Let me thank Qi Ye on my father’s behalf.

124
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,200
And also Brother Tingxuan.

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Of course.

126
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
But most of all,

127
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
I must thank my sister Ruyi.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Please, upstairs.

129
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Let’s go.

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,800
Let’s go.

131
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Please.

132
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,200
Please.

133
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Brother Tingxuan.

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,080
After you, Mr. Wang.

135
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
This Lin guy is really rich.

136
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,200
He booked this huge restaurant just like that.

137
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
That’s nothing.

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,520
The whole Changbai Restaurant belongs to the Lin family.

139
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Three years ago, he used the Divine Compass taken from the Jin family

140
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,760
to control everyone with power.

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
He started the Ginseng Market.

142
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Officially, it’s run by all ginseng traders in Guandong.

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,960
But for three years, Qi Ye has been in charge.

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,400
What’s the Ginseng Market?

145
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,240
The Ginseng Market

146
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
is where merchants from everywhere

147
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
gather to trade ginseng.

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
It’s held every March.

149
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,960
This year, it coincides with the Grand Mountain Assembly.

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
So it’s even livelier.

151
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,400
Ginseng traders from all over the country gather here.

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,640
Qi Ye is the host.

153
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,040
Just from the trade commissions,

154
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
he makes a fortune.

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
All at the cost of the Jin family back then.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,040
Young Master Yang.

157
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
Please take a look.

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
Please name your price.

159
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,040
Both ginsengs, one price.

160
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Eight thousand silver dollars.

161
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,920
All for eight thousand.

162
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,800
But that’s seven roots!

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,240
Alright.

164
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,920
Deal.

165
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Take them.

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,920
Let’s go.

167
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
Thanks to everyone’s luck today,

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
I got two fine ginsengs.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,360
Look here.

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,920
This one

171
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
is a four-leaf club.

172
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
A regular four-leaf now

173
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,480
is worth twelve hundred silver dollars.

174
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,800
And this one

175
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
is a Four Palms General.

176
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,080
The best among four-leaf ginsengs.

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Over thirty years old.

178
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,320
Worth three thousand.

179
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Three thousand, three thousand.

180
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
The key is

181
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,480
there’s more.

182
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,760
This June Frost.

183
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,920
The best among six-leaf ginsengs.

184
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,360
Look at the stem.

185
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
At least forty years old.

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,800
See these diamond-shaped deep grooves.

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
And the rootlets are covered in pearl dots.

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,480
This one’s worth at least seven or eight thousand.

189
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,800
Maybe even ten thousand.

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Seven, eight thousand, even ten thousand?

191
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,960
That valuable?

192
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,920
Young Master Tingxuan may have lost out this time.

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
He got tricked.

194
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
Hey, you inside.

195
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,360
You didn’t even check the goods.

196
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,040
I advise you not to talk nonsense.

197
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Those five roots

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,400
are below four-leaf grade,

199
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,200
but they’re top quality among their kind.

200
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,480
Altogether, they’re worth a thousand or more.

201
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Maybe the low price blinded you.

202
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,920
You got distracted by the bargain.

203
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,920
And forgot the Four Palms General

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
and June Frost are the real prize.

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,680
Who’d forget?

206
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,960
I was after those two treasures from the start.

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,920
The other five were just a bonus.

208
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,080
Why not take a good deal?

209
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Alright.

210
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,600
Let’s talk about your two ginsengs.

211
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,480
This Four Palms General before you—

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
its skin color is fake.

213
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
Try rubbing it with your hand, Young Master Tingxuan.

214
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,680
I’m sure you see it now.

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Now, about your June Frost.

216
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Its shape is fine,

217
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
and the rootlets are full of pearl dots.

218
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
But be careful,

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,800
the rootlets break easily.

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
If they break,

221
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,160
you’ll see the break point.

222
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,360
It should be tender and white.

223
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,800
That means it’s not wild old ginseng.

224
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,160
Fake! Fake! Not wild ginseng!

225
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
It’s a scam!

226
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Trying to fool the Yang family?

227
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,680
Guards!

228
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,160
Go after those two!

229
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,920
Brother.

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
Enough, don’t embarrass us here.

231
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,040
It’s just a few thousand silver dollars.

232
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,680
Boss He.

233
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
I’ll get straight to the point.

234
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
Boss He,

235
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,800
what business do you want with Qi Ye?

236
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,800
Our master asked our manager

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,360
to find a special ginseng for medicine.

238
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
It must be top grade.

239
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
Ordinary four- or five-leaf ginseng

240
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
won’t do at all.

241
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,800
It has to be the Seven Fairies Jin Buhuan found.

242
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,480
The Grand Mountain Assembly is about to start.

243
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
We came to ask Qi Ye

244
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
to help us during the assembly

245
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
and dig up the Seven Fairies.

246
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
Boss He,

247
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
may wealth flow to you.

248
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,280
Back then, Jin used the Nine Immortals Divine Compass

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,040
to find the Seven Fairies.

250
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,160
But Jin later angered the Mountain God

251
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,040
and was punished.

252
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
So—

253
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
Take a look at this.

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,160
The Nine Immortals Divine Compass is now with my Lin family.

255
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,000
If you want to find the Seven Fairies—

256
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the deposit.

257
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,600
If Qi Ye can dig up the Seven Fairies
this time,

258
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
we'll pay another ten thousand dollars.

259
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,160
Let's see who gets the best
ginseng root today.

260
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,120
That Qi Ye...

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,720
He had the advantage back then.

262
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
He relied on having the compass.

263
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,920
Now he's reaching into my territory.

264
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,000
If you show no mercy,

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,720
don't blame me for being ruthless.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Just as we spoke, Qi Ye came downstairs.

267
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,680
Everyone,

268
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
please take your seats.

269
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Congratulations, Qi Ye.

270
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,840
Congratulations to you as well.

271
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,000
Please, have a seat.

272
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Hello, Qi Ye.

273
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,680
Everyone,

274
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,680
quiet down, please.

275
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,920
Today,

276
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
first, we celebrate my birthday.

277
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,440
Second,

278
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
I've prepared this opportunity for you all

279
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,360
to exchange what you have and need,

280
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
and help each other.

281
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,160
For three days from now,

282
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,800
the Grand Mountain Assembly held
every three years.

283
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
So everyone can gain something.

284
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,040
Alright.

285
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
There's an old saying in our trade,

286
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,440
"When the compass appears,
the ginseng king is found."

287
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,680
Today, I, Lin, will present

288
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,120
a treasured item from my family.

289
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,440
To liven up the gathering.

290
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,160
Please, take a look.

291
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,240
This is the legendary

292
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,040
Nine Immortals Divine Compass
that finds the ginseng king.

293
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,680
It's said Jin Buhuan used it back then

294
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,360
to discover that

295
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
priceless Seven Fairies.

296
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,680
Really?

297
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,040
Your family's treasure?

298
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
Qi Ye Lin,

299
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
are you getting senile?

300
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,800
You're speaking without thinking.

301
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Jin Shisan!

302
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,360
What are you—

303
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
What nonsense are you spouting?

304
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Why are you all just standing there?

305
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Hurry and throw him out!

306
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,480
Back then, my father and all
the Jin family

307
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,120
were buried beneath the mountain temple.

308
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
And your Lin family

309
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,680
took the chance to kidnap me
and my sister,

310
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,440
and stole the Nine Immortals Compass.

311
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,600
You even tried to violate my sister,

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
forcing her to take her own life.

313
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,560
For these three years,

314
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
your Lin family kept sending assassins

315
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,560
to take my life.

316
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,440
Now you talk of virtue and morality here,

317
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,000
throwing a grand banquet.

318
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,680
My friend, you must be mistaken.

319
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
The Lin family has always been upright.

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,680
We were sworn brothers with Jin Batou.

321
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,440
How could we do such disgraceful things?

322
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Three years ago, Jin Batou grew greedy.

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He was punished by the mountain god.

324
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,240
That's why his whole clan was cursed.

325
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,920
What does that have to do with us?

326
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,680
Cursed?

327
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,800
Old Lin,

328
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,240
why don't you check above your head

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
to see if a curse has fallen on you?

330
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
It was Lin Wancheng.

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
He raided the Jin family,

332
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
stole the compass,

333
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,040
and killed Jin family descendants.

334
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,040
Lin Wancheng made me do it all.

335
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,920
Spare me, please!

336
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
I'm telling the truth.

337
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,240
You promised to spare my life.

338
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,680
Nine Immortals Compass—

339
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600
the ginseng king comes with it.

340
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,040
The Nine Immortals Compass
belongs to my Jin family.

341
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,360
It bears the Jin name.

342
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,920
It will always bear the Jin name.

343
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,920
Three days from now is my father's memorial.

344
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,480
I came here today

345
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,840
to reclaim what belongs to the Jin family.
