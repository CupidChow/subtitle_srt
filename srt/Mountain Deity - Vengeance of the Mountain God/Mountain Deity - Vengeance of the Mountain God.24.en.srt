1
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,480
Dad

2
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,680
Ruyi

3
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,960
You're awake

4
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,960
Come here

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Come here

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,120
Come

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Eating corn? Come over

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
This corn is delicious

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Try it

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,800
How is it?

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
Sweet

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,760
Dad

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,480
Ting Xuan and I came back to see you

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,080
Dad

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,760
Ruyi

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Just went to the doctor

17
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,560
Jiu'er is pregnant

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,920
That's great

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Ruyi, go tell everyone quickly

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,360
Set up tents, serve porridge

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
I want to earn merit for my grandson

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Okay

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,480
Ruyi

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Why not let Jin Shisan come pay respects to Dad

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
For our Yang family's future son-in-law

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,200
Save a wedding candy

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,640
Right?

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,080
Okay

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,760
Sounds good

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
Brother, you're a father now

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
Still not serious

32
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Well

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
She's getting shy now

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,200
Come

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,640
Come, slow down

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,200
Slow down, slow down

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Haiyue

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,080
Alright, alright

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Haiyue

40
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,240
Bao Bao

41
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,080
Flowers

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
And tasty food

43
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,560
Sit down, sit down

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
All my favorites

45
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,680
You try one first

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Is it good?

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,000
It's good

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,680
I got this at Hao's Butcher Shop

49
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,960
Waited a long time to buy it

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,400
All your favorites

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Pig's head, pig ears, and pig feet

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,280
Eat more

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Come

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I heard, I heard

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
It's moving

56
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Just like his dad

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Never proper

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,960
So naughty

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
Must be a big chubby boy

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Dad

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,240
Jiu'er, look

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
Dad brought us a big gift

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Only this rarest ginseng

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Is worthy of my eldest grandson

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
So mysterious

66
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
Open it and see

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,280
Phoenix's Single Tear

68
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,400
Dad

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
This is too precious

70
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,640
Dad

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,560
It's fine, it's fine

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
Didn't you sell it?

73
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,680
Ruyi

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,680
What nonsense

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,800
This is the world's one and only ginseng

76
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
Who could afford it?

77
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Silly girl

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,960
Exactly

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,680
Didn't sell it?

80
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you, Dad

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,840
Thank you, Dad

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,000
Dad, you're so good to your grandson

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
Of course

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
Wait, that's not right

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,000
When he grows up

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,960
He'll surely honor you

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
I remember I sold it

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,640
Sold it to Boss He

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
Phoenix's Single Tear

90
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,400
Brother

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Brother

92
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,680
I got this at the Earth Temple

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
It's very effective

94
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
Before, with Brother Jin

95
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,280
When we dug for Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,240
I wore it then

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,560
Now you wear it

98
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,400
Alright

99
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
So this amulet is with me

100
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
You have to stick with me

101
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
You're not my Bao Bao

102
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,000
My Bao Bao

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,360
He's not as perfect as you

104
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Nor such fancy clothes

105
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,120
Never gave me flowers

106
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,840
Haiyue

107
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,640
But

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
He's the Bao Bao who loves me most

109
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,480
I want to find him

110
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Dad

111
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
You're finally taking Xing'er and me on a ginseng expedition

112
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
Let me show you my skills

113
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Look at you, so capable

114
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Just be a proper Flank Guard

115
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,640
It's time

116
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's head out

117
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,040
Dad

118
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Your pocket watch

119
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,400
Didn't you sell it?

120
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
Which eye saw me sell it?

121
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,960
This is our Jin family's heirloom

122
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,280
I'll pass it to you someday

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,400
What?

124
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,400
Want to see it?

125
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,960
A dragon's whiskers hang pearls

126
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
Pack up, let's go

127
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,960
Dad

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,640
Xing'er

129
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
I can't go with you

130
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
Why can't you go?

131
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Why not?

132
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,080
Dad

133
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,080
I've waited day and night

134
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,760
Just for you to say this

135
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
I want to be your Flank Guard

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
When wolves and tigers attack

137
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,200
I can protect you

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,200
I want to be your right-hand man

139
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
Watching your back

140
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,840
I feel most at ease

141
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,960
I want to be your point man.

142
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,200
Dig up the biggest ginseng
to honor you.

143
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,080
But...

144
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,200
I...

145
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll never join you
on a ginseng expedition again.

146
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,600
Brother...

147
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,040
What do you mean, no more chances?

149
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
Dad always said he'd take you.

150
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,720
Xing'er...

151
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm useless.

152
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,880
I failed to protect you.

153
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm sorry I let you down.

154
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Remember...

155
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
Stay by Dad's side.

156
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,040
I hope you'll be happy.

157
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,400
Content.

158
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,440
And safe.

159
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
I don't understand
what you're saying.

160
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Let's go.

161
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,760
Stop talking nonsense.

162
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,720
Time's up.

163
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,400
Let's hurry and go.

164
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
Come on, brother.

165
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,760
Let's go.

166
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I can't go anymore.

167
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
I know this is a dream.

168
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
I wish I could stay
in this dream.

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,520
But dreams...

170
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,200
always end when you wake up.

171
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,760
Dad...

172
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
Jin Shisan regrets
his past choices.

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,080
I didn't enter the Mountain God Temple
with you that day.

174
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,160
I never thought
that farewell at the temple

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,840
would be our last
in this world.

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Jin Shisan has missed you
day and night.

177
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
To see you today

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,520
is a blessing
I thank the heavens for.

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,760
But my time is up too.

180
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,760
I have to go my own way now.

181
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,520
Jin Shisan will remember
your teachings and our family creed.

182
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,440
This is farewell.

183
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Oh, Dad...

184
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,400
I've found someone
who matters to me.

185
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Don't worry, Dad.

186
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
I'll live well.

187
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,040
If your spirit is watching
from above,

188
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,440
even if we're worlds apart,

189
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
please bring Xing'er

190
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,640
to visit me in my dreams.

191
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,400
Ruyi...

192
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,600
Jin Shisan...

193
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,840
Jin Shisan, how is he?

194
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,520
Jin Shisan...

195
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,280
Go check on him.

196
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,640
Go.

197
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,400
Haiyue...

198
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,760
Sister Ruyi...

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,960
How is he?

200
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,760
Bao Bao...

201
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,440
Bao Bao...

202
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,280
Bao Bao...

203
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,600
Bao...

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,960
Bao Bao...

205
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Bao Bao...

206
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
It hurts! Hurts, hurts!

207
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,040
Where does it hurt?

208
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,320
I have the Divine Dragon's
Twin-Incense Ginseng.

209
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
The Nine Immortals' Compass.

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Do you know what
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is?

211
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,520
This is the Divine Dragon's
Twin-Incense Ginseng.

212
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,840
They're all mine.

213
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Compass...

214
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,520
Chicken soup's here!

215
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,520
Bao Bao...

216
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,720
Lie down, lie down.

217
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Come.

218
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Let me tuck you in.

219
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,280
Does it taste good?

220
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,520
It's good.

221
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,400
Have you thought of
the baby's name?

222
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
I've already decided.

223
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,640
What's the name?

224
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,200
We'll call him...

225
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,080
Lord Yan.

226
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Are you serious?

227
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
Isn't it a good name?

228
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,520
From now on, whoever meets our child

229
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
will have to call him "Grandpa."

230
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Grandpa...

231
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
Grandpa...

232
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
Grandpa, Grandpa...

233
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,840
Grandpa...

234
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,560
Look at me again.

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,840
The ginseng is about to run away!
