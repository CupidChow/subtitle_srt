1
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,160
Thank you, Grand Sorcerer, for saving us.

2
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,840
Jin Shisan

3
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,520
Jin Buhuan

4
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
You truly raised a fine son.

5
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Hurry, head down the mountain.

6
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,880
Hurry, head down the mountain.

7
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,800
Let's go.

8
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,920
Shisan.

9
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,640
Jinzi, Brother Jinzi.

10
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,280
Shisan.

11
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,120
Come, give it to me.

12
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
Go, Baobao.

13
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,000
The archer must be an expert.

14
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
Definitely an expert.

15
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,120
Who are you?

16
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
And who are you?

17
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm Cui Haiyue from Songling Ginseng House.

18
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,400
Who are you?

19
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm with the Ginseng Guild.

20
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,360
Then why haven't I seen you before?

21
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,920
Why are you here?

22
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Do you know where Brother Shisan is?

23
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,760
Jinzi is my brother.

24
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
He's never mentioned

25
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,400
knowing any girl from the foothills.

26
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,040
Are you a Ginseng Guild assassin?

27
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,000
What kind of brother are you to him?

28
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
I've never heard him mention you either.

29
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Where's Brother Shisan?

30
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,360
I have urgent news for him.

31
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,920
Jinzi isn't here.

32
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,120
If you have something to say,

33
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,200
say it clearly right here.

34
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Wait.

35
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,760
If you don't tell the truth,

36
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,760
you'll stay here like a wild boar.

37
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,760
You...

38
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,760
There are traps all around you anyway.

39
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,200
If you don't want to get hurt,

40
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
you'd better stay put.

41
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait for us to return.

42
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,960
Scoundrel.

43
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,640
Baobao.

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,680
Baobao.

45
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,120
Jinzi can't hold on.

46
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,960
What's wrong with Jinzi?

47
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,480
Let's go.

48
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Come back.

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,520
I...

50
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Come back.

51
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Shisan.

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,680
Shisan.

53
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,200
Brother Jinzi.

54
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You're finally back.

55
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,680
The arrow is poisoned.

56
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Take care of him.

57
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
I'll go find Cui Haiyue.

58
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,520
Cui Haiyue.

59
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,080
That's right.

60
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
Cui Haiyue, head of Cui Ginseng House.

61
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Only she can cure this poison.

62
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
I'm Cui Haiyue from Songling Ginseng House.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,520
Let go, quickly.

64
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
I know her.

65
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Shisan.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Hang in there, Jinzi.

67
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
Hold on, please.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
It really is Dragon Serpent Venom.

69
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,080
How is Brother Jinzi?

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
He should be fine now.

71
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,080
But when he'll wake up

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
depends on his own strength.

73
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,360
That Dragon Serpent Venom you mentioned,

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
what kind of poison is it?

75
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,800
The Dragon Serpent is a rare giant snake in Changbai Mountain.

76
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,080
Its fangs release venomous blood

77
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,640
that no medicine can cure.

78
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Only its own gallbladder

79
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
can counteract the poison.

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
What I just gave Brother Shisan

81
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
was the Dragon Serpent's gallbladder.

82
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,960
Earth Spirit,

83
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
we brothers are in trouble today,

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,800
seeking refuge in your sacred land.

85
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Your power knows no bounds.

86
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Great mercy and compassion.

87
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,960
Please bless Brother Jinzi with safety.

88
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
Bless him, bless him.

89
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Master looks radiant today.

90
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,520
Clearly, good fortune has arrived.

91
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Jiu'er,

92
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
this teapot was a gift from Emperor Qianlong.

93
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Lin Lao Qi's house has plenty of antiques.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,360
It's a pity,

95
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
he wasn't destined to enjoy them.

96
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,240
It's because he and his son overestimated themselves.

97
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Without the right skills,

98
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
they insisted on challenging the master

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,520
for the prized porcelain of Liuhe Hall.

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,360
And that Yang Tingxuan is useless too.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,960
I knew he'd never amount to anything.

102
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
But there's nothing we can do.

103
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Someone has to take the lead.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
How pitiful.

105
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,080
Now Lin Ginseng House has no one in charge.

106
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,800
It's all scattered.

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,240
No one to even manage the funeral.

108
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,360
Jiu'er is the most considerate.

109
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,080
So let's

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,960
see them off.

111
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Thank you, Master.

112
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,680
Gauze.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Gauze, gauze.

114
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,200
Gauze.

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Towel.

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
Towel, towel.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,960
Towel.

118
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,040
Hot water.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Hot water.

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,840
Move aside.

121
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,520
Take this.

122
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Take this.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
Here, rinse it.

124
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Here.

125
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Looks like the gallbladder is working.

126
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,400
The poisoned blood is oozing out.

127
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll change his gauze.

128
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Let me do it.

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
I'll do it, I'll do it.

130
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,080
Take this.

131
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
What are you staring at? I'll do it.

132
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,000
Boss Cui

133
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,720
No, no

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
Sister Ruyi

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
You're a senior

136
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,800
Just call me Haiyue

137
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
Alright, Haiyue

138
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,920
Um

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
Thank you so much for today

140
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,360
You saved Jin Shisan

141
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
I mean

142
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,480
Um

143
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,680
He saved my life before

144
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,440
So you helped me repay a favor

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,880
It's nothing

146
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,120
It's what I should do

147
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,560
He owes me this time

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,120
You

149
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,880
Are you close with him?

150
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
We're all from the Ginseng Guild

151
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,800
Helping each other is right

152
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,680
Well, then

153
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,880
Please look after Jin Shisan

154
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,120
Um

155
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,880
I have something to do

156
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,680
I'll go now

157
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,680
Don't be discouraged

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
Jin Shisan is so cunning

159
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,240
Trying to take the Divine Compass from him

160
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,880
It's not that easy

161
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,680
What do you know?

162
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
My father is getting senile

163
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
He gave the business to Ruyi

164
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,120
If I don't do something soon

165
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,240
I'll lose my place in the Yang family

166
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,560
Alright, alright

167
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
I don't know anything

168
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,720
I just hate seeing you upset

169
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,120
Okay, I know

170
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,680
You're the best

171
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,160
Miss, you're here

172
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,240
Miss

173
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Yang Tingxuan

174
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,680
Miss

175
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
It's not proper for you to go in now

176
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Yang Tingxuan

177
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,120
You're a grown lady

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,680
It's not appropriate

179
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,000
You should hide for now

180
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Yang Tingxuan, Miss

181
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,920
You can't go in now

182
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,040
Miss

183
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Young Master Yang

184
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
Yang Tingxuan

185
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
For a compass

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,040
Even your own sister's life

187
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,240
You'd risk it, wouldn't you?

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
I never knew before

189
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,680
You could be so ruthless

190
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,440
You brat

191
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
No respect for elders

192
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
What nonsense are you saying?

193
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,240
Who doesn't care about your life?

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
That night, you shot a hidden arrow at me

195
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,680
Did you know the arrow was poisoned?

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
What if I died?

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
What hidden arrow?

198
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,240
What poison?

199
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,040
That night

200
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,360
I lost you halfway

201
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,880
It was dark and cold

202
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
I was afraid of getting lost, so I went back

203
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
It wasn't you

204
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
Then who was it?

205
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,320
You don't know, so you ask me

206
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
I haven't asked you yet

207
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Did Jin Shisan catch up?

208
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,800
You brat

209
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm talking to you

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,720
Geomancy

211
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,720
Red means treasure energy

212
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
White means evil energy

213
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
Observe people

214
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
Red means life energy

215
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
White means death energy

216
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,680
Shisan

217
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
Never be impatient when using Geomantic Vision

218
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Balance the yin and yang within you

219
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,480
Brother Jin

220
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,600
You're awake

221
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,600
Quick, quick

222
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,560
Brother Jin, what's wrong with your eye?

223
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,880
It's nothing

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,160
Whenever I use Geomantic Vision

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
This eye gets bloodshot

226
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,240
Others don't know

227
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
They think I have heterochromia

228
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,560
So that's why

229
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,560
Where's Uncle Luo?

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,320
Uncle Luo is guarding in the woods

231
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,120
He hasn't returned yet

232
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,040
Brother Shisan

233
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
You're awake

234
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,320
Brother Jin

235
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
You came back from the brink this time

236
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
Thanks to this young lady saving you

237
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Her name is Cui

238
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
Cui Haiyue

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
From Cui Ginseng House

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,600
Yes, yes

241
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
Cui Haiyue

242
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
You have no idea how dangerous it was

243
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,680
The arrow that hit you had

244
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,560
It was coated with Dragon Serpent Venom

245
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,040
That giant serpent is called Dragon Serpent

246
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
I gave you its gallbladder

247
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
Fighting poison with poison

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,480
Thank you, Miss Cui, for saving me

249
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,600
Brother Shisan

250
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,360
Just call me Haiyue

251
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Speaking of which

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,440
That gallbladder was from Jin Buhuan

253
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
He got it with my father at the Grand Mountain Assembly

254
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,720
That Yang Tingxuan

255
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
He really tried to kill you for the Divine Compass

256
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
It's not that simple

257
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,880
Yang Tingxuan couldn't get Dragon Serpent Venom alone

258
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
That's right

259
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,800
Yang Tingxuan is young and impulsive

260
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
At best, he's just a pawn

261
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
Someone powerful must be guiding him

262
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,560
Brother Jin

263
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,160
What will you do next?

264
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
The most dangerous place is the safest

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,000
Return to the Ginseng Guild

266
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,360
The Lin father and son vanished overnight

267
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah

268
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
It's really strange

269
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,160
Ginseng House business

270
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Master Lin never let others handle it

271
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,440
All of a sudden

272
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,680
What do we do next?

273
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,920
Duan family, Master Duan Jiu is here

274
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,800
Master Jiu, Master Jiu, you're here

275
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,480
Master Jiu, Master Jiu, Master Jiu

276
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
Master Jiu, you're here, Master Jiu, you're here

277
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,320
Master Jiu, Master Jiu, Master Jiu

278
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,000
Everyone,

279
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
These are turbulent times.

280
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
The Lin family has suffered misfortune.

281
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,000
I, Duan, am deeply saddened as well.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
Seventh Master and I are sworn brothers.

283
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,440
Everyone here knows that.

284
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Yes, yes.

285
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,560
I treated their eldest, Wancheng, as my own.

286
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,440
Now both of them are gone.

287
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,160
Their bodies can't even be found.

288
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
I must see them off one last time.

289
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,560
Seventh Master was always ambitious.

290
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,920
He grew the Lin Ginseng House year after year.

291
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,320
He made it one of the top houses

292
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,480
in the entire Changbai Ginseng Guild.

293
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
All of you have worked here for years.

294
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,000
Diligently,

295
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
and loyally.

296
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,360
I, Duan, can't bear to see his legacy fall.

297
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,560
So,

298
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,320
though I am not the most capable,

299
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
and my strength is limited,

300
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,240
I am willing to invest and take over the Lin Ginseng House.

301
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
So everyone can keep their livelihood,

302
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
and have something to rely on.

303
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,440
Thank you, Ninth Master! So generous, Ninth Master!

304
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,480
Ninth Master, you worry too much.

305
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Why is Young Master Jin here?

306
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,600
Young Master Jin has arrived.

307
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,440
Ninth Master.

308
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,680
Everyone,

309
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I am but a humble junior.

310
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,560
This Lin Ginseng House

311
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,800
now belongs entirely to me, Jin Shisan.

312
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,560
How did it become his? Why?

313
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,200
Here are all the contracts and documents.

314
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
What does this mean? What?

315
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,080
Look.

316
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Let me see. Let me see.

317
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Look.

318
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,320
See what's written here.

319
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,800
I am here today

320
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,680
to announce three things.

321
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
The first,

322
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,960
Lin Ginseng House is officially renamed Jin Ginseng House.

323
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,080
It's renamed to Jin House!

324
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,600
The second,

325
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,720
Seventh Master Lin promised you yearly dividends.

326
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
I will double that amount.

327
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Good! Good!

328
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,960
Great! Wonderful! Wonderful!

329
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
Good! So good!

330
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,080
The third,

331
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
and the most important,

332
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,360
My Jin Ginseng House

333
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,200
as the third largest house in the Changbai Guild,

334
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,080
will join this year's Grand Mountain Assembly.

335
00:19:37,680 --> 00:20:00,880
Chief Jin! Chief Jin! Chief Jin!
