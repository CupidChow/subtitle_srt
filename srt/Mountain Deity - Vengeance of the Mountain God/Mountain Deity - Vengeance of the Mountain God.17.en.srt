1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Yang Er Xiaojie

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
Thank you for your trouble this time.

3
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,520
When you return, please give my regards
to Ba Ye.

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
Lu Laoban, you are too kind.

5
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
You can drop me off here.

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,040
Go on back quickly. All right.

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,360
Wait a moment.

8
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,360
Urgent telegram.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,440
Telegram.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,440
Miss Er Xiaojie.

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
An urgent telegram from Miss Bai.

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,200
Bai Tao.

13
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,040
Jin Shisan

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Boss Jin

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,680
Please don't take offense.

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,200
The bank has its own rules.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Understood.

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
Once I sell ginseng in Fengtian
and make money,

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
I'll redeem it.

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,720
There is always a way out.

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,120
Then I'll wait for your good news,
Boss Jin.

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,000
Suit yourself.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
As the saying goes, thirty years east of the river,

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,400
thirty years west of the river.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,400
Isn't that coming true now?

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
Keep your voice down.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,040
Think about it.

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,120
Who is he fighting against?

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
That's Duan Jiuye.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Exactly.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
Move along, move along.

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
Nothing to see here.

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,720
Go.

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Why are you upset? Just a few words.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,160
Go.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,120
Watch your mouth.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
When people are arrogant, rain falls.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
When heaven is wild, disaster strikes.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Young Master Yang.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,440
It's heaven's wildness that brings rain.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,880
Arrogance brings disaster.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
It's all the same.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Jin Shisan and Duan Lao Jiu

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
The fiercer their fight, the better.

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,560
I'll just watch the show from the side.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Right.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
This drama,

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,800
I enjoy watching it too.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
But the wine you bought on credit—

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you know?

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Jin and Duan families have both
risked everything this time.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Don't think Jin Shisan is finished
just because he lost his ginseng house.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,360
But Duan Lao Jiu isn't doing well either.

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,960
That's right.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
To raise the price, he bought up ginseng.

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,240
He borrowed from every bank and money house.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
Duan family's assets—

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,720
Everything that could be mortgaged
has been mortgaged.

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,600
Duan family is struggling.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Our little shop isn't doing well either.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,440
No one is doing well.

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,720
Best if they destroy each other.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
All the ginseng we've bought is moved in.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
We've begged everyone these days.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
This is all we've managed to collect.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,440
The remaining ginseng houses and farmers

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,000
are all rushing to sell to Duan Jiuye.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
Duan family's warehouse is almost full.

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Brother Shisan.

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,320
You're back.

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,960
Brother Shisan.

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been checking accounts for hours.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,360
This is all the cash Cui's Apothecary
can spare.

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,360
If needed, I'll mortgage the apothecary.

76
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,800
No need. I appreciate your kindness.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
If you do that,

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,600
how will you face your family in Korea?

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,720
Brother Shisan.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
You're destined for great things.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't help much,

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,720
but I want to help you get Jin Ginseng House back.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,160
No rush.

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
This was my oversight.

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
To raise the ginseng price,

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
we went way over budget.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,600
Let the ginseng house stay at the bank for now.

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't worry.

89
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,360
It won't grow legs and run away.

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,600
That's right, Haiyue.

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
You don't need to worry.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Ba Ye said he'd help us.

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,720
Enough, you two.

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,600
We're being honest here.

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,960
I'll speak plainly.

96
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,800
I told Ba Ye

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,720
I'd protect Ruiyi like a sister.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
So I don't want to involve the Yang family.

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
Haiyue, same goes for you.

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,440
I also protect you like a sister.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,240
So I don't want to drag the Cui family in.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,360
Hear that? Brother Jin is loyal.

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
Be a good little sister.

104
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,080
None of your business.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,240
But Haiyue,

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,360
I do have something important

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,520
I need your help with.

108
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,240
Of course.

109
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Come and take a look!

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Jin Ginseng House is buying today

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,880
at eighty percent of the top market price!

112
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Come and see!

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
If you work with Jin Ginseng House,

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,160
Cui's Apothecary will give you a discount!

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
Take a look!

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Boss Wang, long time no see.

117
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,200
May your business prosper!

118
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Boss Jin

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,320
Wishing you prosperity!

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Long time no see, Boss Wang.

121
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Take a look.

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,440
I've brought all the ginseng for you.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Take a look.

124
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
How's the quality?

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
Good—plump and full.

126
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,240
The quality is excellent.

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,760
It's good, right?

128
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,200
Alright.

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
Come on, let's seal the deal.

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Guarantee.

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on, Boss Wang. All right.

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,720
All right.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
Goodbye, everyone. Farewell.

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,520
Thank you, thank you. Thanks, Boss Wang.

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
Take care. Take care, everyone.

136
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Come, take a look, have a look!

137
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
Baobao, come and see, come and look.

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
These ginsengs we collected today

139
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
will be sent to Fengtian soon.

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,320
When you meet Boss He,

141
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,080
talk to him properly.

142
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't worry, brother.

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,200
Take a look, have a look!

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Jin Ginseng House.

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,880
All right, I got it. You may go.

146
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,320
Yes.

147
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Cui Haiyue is such a spendthrift.

148
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,600
Duan Jiuye.

149
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,360
I just can't figure it out.

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,440
We're real sisters.

151
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,160
I'm more capable at work than her.

152
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm much stronger than her in ability.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
Why do the elders in our family

154
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
always choose her, not me?

155
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
Cui Steward,

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
don't rush.

157
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Follow Duan Jiuye.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Cui's Apothecary will be yours one day.

159
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Do you know why?

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Ambition.

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,640
That's what Duan Jiuye values most in you.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Duan Jiuye.

163
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
Is it bad to have ambition?

164
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Cui Haiyue is just heartless.

165
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,760
She ignores the apothecary's business.

166
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,800
As a young woman,

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,640
she keeps chasing after Jin Shisan every day.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
Always calling him "Brother Shisan."

169
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Just like a fan chasing an actor in the theater.

170
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,920
Your Cui's Apothecary is originally in Korea.

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
If you want to settle in Songling Town,

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
you need someone like Haiyue,

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,320
who's honest and doesn't fight for things.

174
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
That's how you keep the family business.

175
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,040
With your ambition, you'll lose the shop someday.

176
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,440
Don't take it to heart.

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm just nagging, that's all.

178
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,800
Now, go and invite the heads of Changbai Bank,

179
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
Dongqi Bank,

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,640
and Prosperity Bank for me.

181
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,320
Arrange a meeting with them.

182
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Tonight at Chunhua Restaurant, drinks are on me.

183
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Duan Jiuye.

184
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
You still need to borrow money?

185
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,040
Is the ginseng price too high?

186
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
Should we lower it a bit?

187
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,480
That's right.

188
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,360
Invite Ma Boss from Erlong Ling too.

189
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Wait, Duan Jiuye,

190
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,080
you dare borrow money from The Phantoms?

191
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,600
I do want to borrow from The Phantoms.

192
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Go on.

193
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Brother Jinzi.

194
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Take care on the road.

195
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Don't worry, Brother Jinzi.

196
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Haiyue.

197
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
What fun thing do you want?

198
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,920
I'll bring it back for you.

199
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,920
Just don't lose yourself.

200
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Let's go, let's go.

201
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,320
Go.

202
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,240
We're leaving.

203
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
Grab it for me!

204
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,520
Hurry!

205
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
Don't run!

206
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
Screw you!

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,920
Stop!

208
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,080
Run, go ahead, come here!

209
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,880
Boss Cui.

210
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,920
This is the rest of the goods.

211
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Okay, just put it over there.

212
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Okay.

213
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,760
Come.

214
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Slow down.

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,560
Brother Jinzi.

216
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,200
Brother Jinzi.

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,840
Baobao.

218
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,560
This...

219
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,280
What's wrong, Baobao?

220
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,880
Brother Jinzi.

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm sorry to you.

222
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,760
Get up and talk.

223
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
Get up.

224
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,640
Come.

225
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,880
Sit.

226
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Are you all right, Baobao?

227
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,440
Didn't I tell you to go to Fengtian

228
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
and deliver ginseng to Liuhe Tang?

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,960
What happened?

230
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,200
The Phantoms robbed everything halfway.

231
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,640
You got robbed?

232
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
So much stuff...

233
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,880
Haiyue.

234
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,680
I...

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,760
It's fine, it's fine.

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll figure something out.

237
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Boss Jin, do you still want this ginseng?

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Are we still doing business?

239
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,120
Boss, Jin Ginseng House is done for.

240
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Now, over at Duan's side,

241
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,120
they're offering double Jin's price.

242
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
If we're late, it'll be too late.

243
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Why didn't you say so earlier?

244
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Go, go, go!

245
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Hurry, hurry!

246
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Wait, wait!

247
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Quick, wait!

248
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
We're the ones buying.

249
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,520
Go, go, go!

250
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,080
Sit down.

251
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Go, go, let's go! Hurry, hurry!

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Duan Jiuye, that's what happened.

253
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,080
The money's gone.

254
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000
The ginseng house is gone.

255
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
Liuhe Tang's ginseng is gone too.

256
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Jin Shisan is definitely done for now.

257
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,320
Go get your reward.

258
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
Thank you, Duan Jiuye.

259
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,080
Duan Jiuye.

260
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,520
What's our next step?

261
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Next step...

262
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Come on, come on.

263
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
Let's drink some more.

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Boss.

265
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,640
Boss Jin.

266
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Sorry about this.

267
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
We really can't do business this time.

268
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
Let's work together next time if we can.

269
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,000
Goodbye.

270
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,680
Jin Shisan.

271
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
How can you still be drinking here?

272
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Miss Bai is looking for me.

273
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
It's urgent.

274
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,880
What urgent matter could I have?

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,440
You're the one who should be worried now.

276
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,320
Stop looking. You need to run for your life.

277
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
I've already booked your tickets.

278
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Go hide in Fengtian for a while first.

279
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
Wait until things quiet down a bit.

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Then I'll send Ruiyi over to find you.

281
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
You two can leave together for good.

282
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Never come back again.

283
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Miss Bai,

284
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,440
thank you for your kindness.

285
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm not going anywhere.

286
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
Look at the situation we're in.

287
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,440
Stop worrying about your pride.

288
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,400
All you men are the same.

289
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,880
You'd rather suffer than lose face.

290
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Ruiyi truly cares about you.

291
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I can see it.

292
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,840
You're not indifferent.

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
You have feelings for her too.

294
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Jin Shisan,

295
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,400
don't let her down.

296
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
And don't let yourself down.

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,080
Treat Ruiyi better.

298
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Hang in there.

299
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,000
Just hold on.

300
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,880
Your hand is hurt too.

301
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,120
Haiyue,

302
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,200
you're amazing.

303
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,080
What miracle medicine did you use on me?

304
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,120
I don't feel any pain now.

305
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
I can move freely.

306
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,840
Don't move around.

307
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,280
You didn't break any bones,

308
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
but look at all those bruises on you.

309
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,640
Some are deep, some are light.

310
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
And you hit your head pretty hard.

311
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,320
Who knows if there's internal bleeding.

312
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,200
Just sit here for now.

313
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll go make you some medicine.

314
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Haiyue,

315
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,000
if I die this time,

316
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
would you be sad?

317
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,680
Knock on wood, quick!

318
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
How many times have I told you?

319
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't say unlucky things, don't jinx it.

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,640
Got it. Don't worry.

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm not dying.

322
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I still have to take care of you.

323
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,680
And there's Jin Zi and Luo Da too.

324
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,440
Just don't make us worry, that's enough.

325
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,640
I'll go make you some medicine.

326
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Shisan is back.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,680
Shisan,

328
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
don't listen to the rumors outside.

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Saying your uncle plans this or that.

330
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,840
That's impossible.

331
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm here to help you this time.

332
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,120
Just like I helped my father back then.

333
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,280
Just like I helped your father back then.

334
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,000
Tell me,

335
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,560
your father was too stubborn back then.

336
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,400
He never listened to my good advice.

337
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
But you're different.

338
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,320
You're sensible, nephew.

339
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,080
If you sell me the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

340
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,760
and the Nine Immortals' Compass,

341
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,400
you'll have endless wealth and glory.

342
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
Not selling.

343
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
Name your price.

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,200
I want your life.

345
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,840
You're talking like a child again.

346
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Stop saying things out of anger.

347
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm here with real sincerity.

348
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
I redeemed this for you.

349
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,200
That was a good deed.

350
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,640
Jin Ginseng House.

351
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,400
Liuhe Tang wiped me out.

352
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,200
Jin Ginseng House is different in your hands.

353
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
You can't put it that way.

354
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
Just sell me these two treasures.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
How much do you want?

356
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,640
I'll give you whatever you ask.

357
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
The ginseng I've collected—

358
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,440
if you want it,

359
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
we can go into business together.

360
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,200
We just need to report to Liuhe Tang together.

361
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,080
If you want my position, that's fine too.

362
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,440
You can take over for me.

363
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,760
From now on, the whole guild

364
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
will answer to the two of us.

365
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,880
If you want money,

366
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,320
just say it. I'll give you whatever you want.

367
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,880
Alright.

368
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,440
I'll think about the terms tonight.

369
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,840
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

370
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,320
That's all I wanted to hear.

371
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,440
Shisan,

372
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm waiting for your good news.
