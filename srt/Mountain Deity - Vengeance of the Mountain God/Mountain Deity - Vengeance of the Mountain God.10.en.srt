1
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,680
Wake up.

2
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,920
Wake up.

3
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,120
Wake up.

4
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
It's me. Don't— Don't come closer.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
It's me. It's me.

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,840
You're safe now.

7
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,680
You're safe.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Jin Shisan.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,080
It's me.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,640
It's all right now.

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,480
It's all right.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
This is the southern slope
of Changbai Mountain.

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
Hardly anyone comes here.

14
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,960
There's a heavy chill here.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
You must've fallen into
the Phantom Maze.

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,960
That's why you couldn't get out.

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,640
So you entered the mountain
from the southern slope.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,800
You really don't take
the usual path.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
Looks like you found
the Great Ginseng.

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,880
No wonder you're the Second Young Lady
of the Yang Family.

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,560
You found the Great Ginseng
so quickly.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't want to lose to you.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm not here for victory or defeat.

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm after the truth.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,760
The truth.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,520
Winners rule, losers are outcasts.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,960
In this world, it's always
the winner who decides.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Whatever the winner says—

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,960
—that becomes the truth.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
If that's how it is,

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,240
I have to compete with
Second Young Lady Yang.

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
Take this path in a bit.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
It's relatively safer.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Remember to mark your trail.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
So they can find you.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Don't go alone anymore.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,880
You too.

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
Take care of yourself.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,080
We've searched all morning.

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,680
Haven't even seen a trace
of ginseng.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
You think digging for ginseng

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
is that easy?

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,680
Not just a morning—

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,800
even ten days or half a month
without luck

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
is pretty common.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,240
The terrain here is different
from the west and north slopes.

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,160
It's not the same.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
It's the Descending Dragon Formation.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
The peaks on both sides rise and fall.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,960
You enter through the narrow
wind gap in the middle.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
It's like entering a grand hall.

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
Rein in the horses, raise the flag.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
This kind of terrain

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
is best for storing wind
and gathering energy.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
The closer to the wind gap,

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,320
the closer to the energy point.

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,600
Our chances of finding
the Great Ginseng increase.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
We need to find the energy point first.

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Then we can narrow the search area.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
Jin's right.

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
This is definitely
the Descending Dragon Formation.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,320
But where is the energy point?

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,680
I haven't found it either.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,880
Let's keep looking.

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,080
Let's go.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,320
Ginseng.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,320
What kind?

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,520
What— What kind?

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,440
Idiot.

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
You're joining the mountain.

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,800
You need to say how many leaves.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,160
Careful.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
You're blasting the mountain.

74
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
Hurry and bow to the Lord of the Mountain
to apologize.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
This isn't ginseng,

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
but it's still a small one.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,520
Doesn't count as blasting the mountain.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Careful.

79
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,600
Hurry and bow to the Lord of the Mountain.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Not to apologize.

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,080
It's to give thanks.

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,040
Quick.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,960
Come.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,320
Wait.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,960
Don't you think something's off
about this place?

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
The soil is fine.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
It's brown-black.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,840
Mixed with dead branches and leaves.

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
Three forks, five leaves.

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Facing away from the sun,
toward the shade.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,400
Seeking me.

92
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,120
Linden trees nearby.

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,960
Can't be wrong.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
There's likely Great Ginseng
hidden here.

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,720
I did tie this just now.

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,400
No.

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,440
Even in broad daylight,
we hit a Spirit Wall.

98
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,880
We've marked trails and tied red strings
all the way.

99
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
How are we still mountain disoriented?

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,520
Shisan.

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,840
The first lesson of Geomantic Vision
is reading the energy.

102
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
The "Li Wei: Dou Wei Yi" says—

103
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,720
When the ruler rides wood,
ginseng grows for the king.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
Ginseng below.

105
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Purple energy above.

106
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,720
This century-old mountain ginseng

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,400
is the king of all plants.

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,400
Naturally, it has royal energy.

109
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
That's the purple energy.

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Don't get separated, everyone.

111
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,560
Follow me.

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,280
Let's go.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Brother Shisan.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,560
Look.

115
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
Up ahead should be
the Azure Dragon Ridge.

116
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,960
Be careful.

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
What a small world for rivals.

118
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,840
Should've checked the almanac today.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
No wonder I stepped in crap.

120
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,000
Saw your sorry tail.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Now I get it.

122
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
Who do you think you are?

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,400
How dare you talk to Young Master Yang like that?

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,280
If I didn't have a rule against hitting women, I—

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
And who the hell are you?

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
You think you can hit my brother?

127
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,000
You—

128
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Uh, Boss Jin—

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,080
Young Master Yang—

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
Let's talk this out calmly.

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Eunhee—

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
Why are you with them?

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Shut up.

134
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm not as dumb as you.

135
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm just a wise bird choosing the right tree.

136
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,120
What wise bird?

137
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,080
Guess she's a hot one then.

138
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,280
I mean, Young Master Yang is so suave,

139
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,000
bringing these two birds to the mountain.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Say that again.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Young Master Yang—

142
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
If you fire a gun here,

143
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
and blood is spilled,

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,000
you'll anger the Lord of the Mountain.

145
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Then no one will find the Great Ginseng.

146
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,680
Young Master Yang just wants this forest.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
Let me, Jin Shisan,

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,560
show respect to Eighth and Ninth Masters today.

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll let you have this forest.

150
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Boss Jin, what are you saying?

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
Ninth Master always follows the rules.

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
The ginseng guild's rules—

153
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
First into the forest gets priority.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
The rest must yield.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
Since Boss Jin entered first today,

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,840
the forest should go to Boss Jin.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,400
We're leaving.

158
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,560
The mark left by that girl, Ruyi,

159
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
points right to this forest.

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Now Jin Shisan is here.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,280
There must be Great Ginseng.

162
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
Why give it to them?

163
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Just do as I say.

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,120
Fall back.

165
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,080
At least you know your place.

166
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,560
No idea what that woman

167
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,840
is really up to.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Doesn't matter.

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,560
Haiyue—

170
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,280
Let me see your wound.

171
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,120
Does it hurt?

172
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
Move aside.

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
You get hit and don't even fight back.

174
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,880
I always have to protect you.

175
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,240
And another thing—

176
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,120
How could you talk about my sister like that?

177
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
So what should I do?

178
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
Did I offend our sister?

179
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,840
What do you mean, "our" sister?

180
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
She's not yours.

181
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
We're heading to Azure Dragon Ridge.

182
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,760
We'll set up camp there.

183
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,160
Jinzi—

184
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,520
Do you think tomorrow

185
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,720
we can find the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

186
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
We're right across from it.

187
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
You mean—

188
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,280
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is opposite Azure Dragon Ridge?

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,960
That's right.

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
I checked it out during the day.

191
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,720
This forest,

192
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
and the plants on this cliff,

193
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,080
all bow toward the opposite cliff.

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
My father once said,

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,920
the key to picking ginseng is reading the terrain.

196
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,920
You observe the plants' posture.

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,160
A century-old ginseng is king of all plants.

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,520
When it appears,

199
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,040
the surrounding plants

200
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
bend toward it as the center.

201
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,040
It's like they're paying homage.

202
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
There's a saying for this.

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,960
It's called Homage of the Forest.

204
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
That cliff is huge.

205
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
How do we know

206
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,840
where the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is hidden?

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,360
On that cliff,

208
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,600
there must be a hidden cave.

209
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,280
If we find the entrance,

210
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,600
how do we get in?

211
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
The only way is to gather vines,

212
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,400
braid them into a long rope and tie it on.

213
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,360
Then descend along the cliff.

214
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,160
No way.

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,160
It's too dangerous.

216
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
What if the cave is too deep?

217
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
What if the vine snaps?

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,720
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is right there.

219
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,280
For my father,

220
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,600
I'd risk even the King of Hell's palace.

221
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,400
Brother Jinzi—

222
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,720
I'll go with you tomorrow.

223
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,400
No need.

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,040
You guys wait here and cover me.

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
The mantis stalks the cicada,

226
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
but the oriole waits behind.

227
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
Yang Tingxuan and his crew must be nearby.

228
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,600
Jin Shisan—

229
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,040
I've found the century-old ginseng's location.

230
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
Did you find it too?

231
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,600
The book "Spring and Autumn Destiny Pivot" says,

232
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,160
the Yaoguang star scatters and becomes ginseng.

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
If the ruler neglects the mountain's bounty,

234
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
the Yaoguang star dims.

235
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
No ginseng will grow.

236
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,720
This Yaoguang star

237
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,720
is one of the Big Dipper's seven stars.

238
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
If Yaoguang is dim,

239
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,360
it's hard for ginseng to appear.

240
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,520
If Yaoguang shines bright,

241
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,720
ginseng will surely grow.

242
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,080
Dad, look—

243
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Dad—

244
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,960
Dad—

245
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,600
Dad—

246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,160
Dad—

247
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,280
Two and nine are the feet.

248
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Dad—

249
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
You're still alive!

250
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Dad—

251
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
You called on the spirits behind my back again.

252
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,400
Open!

253
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,840
The door's blocked.

254
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,600
It won't open.

255
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,160
Right.

256
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,920
It won't budge.

257
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,080
Why is there blood? There's blood!

258
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,840
Dad—

259
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,640
Hurry, go!

260
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,400
First Immortal: Gold.

261
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
Second Immortal: Silver.

262
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
Third Immortal brings the treasure bowl.

263
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,080
Fourth Immortal plants the longevity tree.

264
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,520
Fifth Immortal nurtures the thousand-year ginseng.

265
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,360
Who's there?

266
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,280
This is poisonous.

267
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,600
I can't move.

268
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,600
Father, how can I save you?

269
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,040
I can't move.

270
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,840
Go!

271
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,720
Who are you?

272
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
Why are you trying to harm us?

273
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,280
No!

274
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Old Jin.

275
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Uncle.

276
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,520
Father.

277
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,720
Jin Shisan.

278
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Jin Shisan, wake up!

279
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,720
Jin Shisan.

280
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,720
Father.

281
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,600
Father.

282
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,280
Father.

283
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Jin Shisan, Father.

284
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,280
Jin Shisan, Jin Shisan.

285
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,840
It's all right now.

286
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,400
It's all right now.

287
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
It's all right now.

288
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
I saw my father.

289
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,520
And Uncle Lizhong.

290
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,160
Someone wants to kill them.

291
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,080
Jin Shisan.

292
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
You might have fallen into a mountain formation.
