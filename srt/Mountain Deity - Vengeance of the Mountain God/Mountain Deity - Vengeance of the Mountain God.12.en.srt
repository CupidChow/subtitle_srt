1
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,120
Aren't you afraid I'll snap this ginseng in half?

2
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,760
We'll all go down together.

3
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
I don't believe it.

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,920
Fine.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,520
I'll hand it over.

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
If the prized ginseng touches the ground,
will it run away?

7
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
Cui,

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,560
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Jiu Niangniang,

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Forgive me.

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Cui,

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,840
You and your sister are so cunning,
always scheming.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
One on each side.

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,440
You never lose, inside or out.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,120
Cui Enxi,

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
You wretched woman.

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I should've shot you last night.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,480
What a grand performance.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
I didn't miss anything, did I?

20
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,200
Jiuye,

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
You arrived just in time.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,880
So it was you—

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,400
I said, "A wise bird chooses a good tree."

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,400
You don't think you're that tree, do you?

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,880
Boss Jin,

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,160
Your family discipline is lacking.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
What a joke.

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Jiuye,

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,160
Help me!

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Jiu'er,

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
You've grown capable.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,800
You're making something of yourself.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,440
You've followed me for years, you should know—

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
I see things in black and white.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,720
I never tolerate any grit in my eyes.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
So why insist on being that grit?

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,480
Jiuye,

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,240
There's something I'm not sure I should say.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
Since Manager Cui is here,

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,760
Go ahead, it's fine.

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
It was our young leader—

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
who accidentally saw

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
Jiu Niangniang and the eldest Yang son

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,080
coming and going together.

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,520
You little brat!

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
Not behaving, are you?

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,360
I'll teach you a lesson for your father today.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
Trying to act refined with those glasses—

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
Learn to be a decent person first.

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Duan Jiuye,

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Take your time with your family matters.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,320
Miss Yang has been poisoned by a snake.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
She needs to go down the mountain for treatment.

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,800
We won't disturb you further.

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Boss Jin is truly noble and righteous.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
Just like your father.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,640
Since someone's hurt,

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,520
let's hurry down the mountain.

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,360
Farewell.

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Farewell.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,240
We're leaving.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Ru Yi's snake venom has reached her heart and lungs.

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,880
Maybe using this snake's blood as a catalyst—

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
Fight poison with poison. It's worth a try.

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
But—

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,800
Getting the snake's blood won't be easy.

68
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,240
I have Divine Dragon Serpent Gall blood in me.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
Use my blood for the medicine.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Go ahead.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,440
Manager Cui did a great job this time.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
Serving Jiuye

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
is an honor Jiuye granted me.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
But there's one more thing—

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
Enxi doesn't quite understand.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,640
I'd like to ask Jiuye.

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Speak.

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
Yesterday was such a good chance—

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
Why didn't Jiuye

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
just take the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,360
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is priceless,

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,880
but the Nine Immortals' Compass is even more vital.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,040
Right now, the Nine Immortals' Compass

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
is in Jin Shisan's hands.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
I don't want to alert him.

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,240
Brother Jin,

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
that dog-face,

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,760
and her clingy brother—

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
they keep causing us trouble.

90
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
Why bother saving her?

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,440
Saving someone is just saving someone.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
No need for so many reasons.

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,760
Didn't expect that old fox Duan

94
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
to be so devious.

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,600
He won't even spare his own woman.

96
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,040
That Duan Jiu—

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
is truly ruthless.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
But he's clever and slick.

99
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
People like him

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
don't get just anyone's blood on their hands.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,640
He's lost his cool this time.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
We must've

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
hit him right where it hurts.

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Brother Shisan,

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
The medicine is ready.

106
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
But I can't get her to take it.

107
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Let me do it.

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,160
Haiyue,

109
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,320
Ru Yi,

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Over here.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Ru Yi,

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,520
Why are you so kind to me?

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,200
Don't talk yet.

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,240
Drink the medicine.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,920
Haiyue,

116
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
I made ginger tea for you.

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,040
It's been too cold in the forest these days.

118
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,320
You've been busy caring for others,

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,440
with no time for yourself.

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,480
Ru Yi,

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,880
She just spat out all the snake venom.

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,080
Come.

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,640
Lie down and rest first.

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Come and see.

125
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Ru Yi's venom is fading away.

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Brother Shisan,

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't worry.

128
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,240
I can take good care of her.

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,320
Thank you for your hard work.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,480
Haiyue,

131
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,440
Ginger tea.

132
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,040
We have the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng now.

133
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
What do we do next?

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Do you know what a good hunter

135
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,800
is best at?

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,040
Good marksmanship.

137
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Never misses a shot.

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
Shooting is important,

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,200
but their true skill is hiding.

140
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
First, conceal yourself.

141
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,520
Wait until your enemy is in sight.

142
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,920
Wait for them to slip up.

143
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Strike and finish them in one blow.

144
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,520
That old fox Duan Jiuye...

145
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll just quietly watch you.

146
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,600
See how many days you have left.

147
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
He's not that easy to deal with.

148
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,640
But right now,

149
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I do need someone.

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,640
Who?

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
I've already sent Uncle Luo to invite them.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,600
You'll meet them in a couple of days.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,800
Miss Yang Er.

154
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
Why aren't you resting?

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Why did you come out?

156
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Miss Yang Er.

157
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
You're still very weak.

158
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,440
Haiyue.

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,480
Take her back to rest.

160
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,760
Weak? Not at all.

161
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
Haiyue's been taking great care of her.

162
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
Jin Shisan.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
The Ginseng King Tournament is about to start.

164
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
You can't miss it.

165
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
Neither can I.

166
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Hey, waiter.

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,560
Wine.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,080
Wine.

169
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,760
Coming, coming!

170
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,960
Young Master Yang.

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Didn't you hear me calling you?

172
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
Are you looking down on me?

173
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,080
I was downstairs calling a car for you.

174
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,440
Forget the damn car.

175
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
Bring me the wine.

176
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,440
We have fine wine here.

177
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
It's all yours.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But look,

179
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,840
it's already this late.

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,320
You should head to the Ginseng King Tournament.

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,200
I heard you just returned from the mountain.

182
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
You must've found some treasures.

183
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,760
At the tournament,

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,120
win some fame for the Yang family.

185
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,320
Bring back some glory.

186
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
I'll set up a banquet.

187
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
We'll celebrate for the Yang family.

188
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,680
A celebration banquet?

189
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Get out.

190
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Jiu'er.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Alright, quiet down, everyone.

193
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,520
Quiet, please.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
The Ginseng King Tournament is over.

195
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Now, show the treasures you've dug up.

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,000
Let everyone have a look.

197
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,400
Who wants to go first?

198
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,440
Boss Lu.

199
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,640
Why don't you start?

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,080
Alright.

201
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,000
Then let's look at mine first.

202
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,760
Everyone,

203
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,280
Take a look.

204
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,840
Lu Family Ginseng Shop.

205
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Four-leaf ginseng.

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
Congratulations, Boss Lu!

207
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Four-leaf ginseng.

208
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Four-leaf ginseng, take a look.

209
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,320
Congratulations.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,760
Wu Leader.

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Congratulations, congratulations.

212
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Duan Jiuye.

213
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,200
Good.

214
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
Congrats, Boss Lu! Well done.

215
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,560
Congrats, Boss Lu! Congrats, Boss Lu!

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Thanks to the Mountain God's blessing,

217
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
this time on the mountain,

218
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,000
our Wu Family Ginseng Shop got this treasure.

219
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,520
Let everyone see it.

220
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,640
Good.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,680
Very good.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Good, good, good.

223
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,880
Wu Leader, that's fine ginseng.

224
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Everyone,

225
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Who will win this year's tournament?

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm sure you all know the answer.

227
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Wu Leader.

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Congratulations.

229
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Jiuye.

230
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,440
You let me win.

231
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,680
This year's Ginseng King is ours, the Wu family.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,760
Though it's a six-leaf mountain ginseng,

233
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,080
it's still young.

234
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,400
Wu Leader is greedy, taking it all.

235
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,960
Be careful, the Mountain God may punish you.

236
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,760
Kid.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
People talk with their mouths.

238
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
Dogs bite with theirs.

239
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,880
Talking big isn't real skill.

240
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
At our Ginseng King Tournament,

241
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,400
it's your treasures that speak.

242
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
Your Jin Family Ginseng Shop

243
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,000
never taught you the rules?

244
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Wu Leader.

245
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,640
My young friend is a bit blunt.

246
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,760
Sorry for the offense.

247
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,200
That Jin family guy

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,640
really doesn't follow the rules.

249
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,000
The Jin family leader

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
isn't even Old Jin's real son.

251
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,440
Just a bastard.

252
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
Let alone their workers.

253
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,760
Ignore him.

254
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Doesn't know the rules.

255
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,880
Brother Jin, Dog-face,

256
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
bring out our stuff.

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
Let's scare them.

258
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Alright, enough.

259
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,200
This isn't a street market.

260
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Don't let outsiders laugh at us.

261
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,400
Looks like Jin and Yang have treasures too.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,280
Then please show them.

263
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,880
Which of you will go first?

264
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,080
I'll go first.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Lantern stand

266
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,440
I sell by the pound at my shop

267
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,440
Miss Yang Er

268
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,560
If your house needs ginseng

269
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll deliver two pounds to your home soon

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,640
Dog-face, what are you holding?

271
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,400
Your phoenix

272
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,840
Sorry to make the elders laugh

273
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm still learning, not skilled yet

274
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,520
I was poisoned during this mountain trip

275
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,000
Thanks to Boss Jin risking his life to save me

276
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,000
That's how I barely survived

277
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
At this Ginseng King Tournament

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,880
My Yang family admits defeat

279
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,200
Yang family dug up the Five Kings

280
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,760
That Jin kid was busy playing hero

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,280
Did he just dig up a wild herb to join in?

282
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,000
Isn't that just fooling yourself?

283
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,640
Big box doesn't matter, it's small inside

284
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,960
Look, look, look!

285
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
It's about to open

286
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,680
This...

287
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Di-Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

288
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,200
What? Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

289
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,440
How can there be something like this?

290
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,320
How is this possible?

291
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,280
This...

292
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,280
Well?

293
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,560
When Brother Jin acts, it's always impressive

294
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,520
Convinced?

295
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,440
Convinced?

296
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,000
The mountain god has blessed us

297
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,280
Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng appears

298
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
This is good fortune for all

299
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,400
Boss Jin

300
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,760
A true master

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,120
At this Ginseng King Tournament

302
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
My Yang family nominates Boss Jin as winner

303
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,520
Elders

304
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Can anyone present

305
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,200
a treasure better than this Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

306
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Boss Jin harvested Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

307
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,560
Such outstanding skill

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,760
Saw Miss Er in trouble

309
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,840
Saved her with chivalry

310
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,880
That's true heroism

311
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,400
Just like our founder in the old days

312
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,320
Please accept the gold plaque, Boss Jin

313
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you all for your kindness

314
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,440
Nonsense!

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,080
Jin

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
You don't deserve this plaque
