1
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,960
What's going on here?

2
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,160
The door is completely blocked.

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,960
It won't open.

4
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
Yeah, it won't open.

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
Boss, why is there blood here?

6
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,640
Blood... blood.

7
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
There's blood here too.

8
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,800
I've got some here too.

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,640
There's blood on me too.

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,080
I've got blood on me too.

11
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,280
Me too.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
First Immortal Gold

13
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
Second Immortal Silver

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Third Immortal brings the Treasure Bowl

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,440
Old Jin, what's this?

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,400
Who?

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
Bro, what's that sound?

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,120
Don't panic, it's fine.

19
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,320
Fourth Immortal plants the Longevity Tree

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,280
Fifth Immortal grows the Millennium Ginseng

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
Who's there?

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,720
What is this?

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,040
What's that? What's happening inside?

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,440
It's smoking.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
Could something be wrong?

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
The greedy snake forgets its tail.

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Defying fate leads to death.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,600
Such wickedness.

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,520
Darn it, all of them.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,840
The Jin Family dug up the Ginseng King and angered the mountain spirit.

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
Run!

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
Help!

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,160
Lord of the Mountain is punishing us, Dad!

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,800
Back in those years,

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
I led a group of brothers

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,160
refusing to do bandit work.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,520
We only hunted in the mountains.

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,920
Once, we ran into a tigress.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
Luckily, Big Brother Jin was picking ginseng.

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,480
He saved my life from the tiger.

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Big Brother Jin in the ginseng guild

42
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
was already highly respected.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,640
That day was especially lively.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
But who could've guessed

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
that day, Big Brother Jin led his clan

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
and soon after entering,

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
around the Mountain Deity Lord's temple,

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,640
nothing like this had ever happened.

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,640
The temple doors stayed shut.

50
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,120
When the doors finally opened,

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Big Brother Jin and the Jin Family

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,000
were all dead, blood everywhere.

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
Listen up.

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,760
Today, turn the Jin Family upside down.

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,920
We must find the Nine Immortals' Compass.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
Jinzi, oh Jinzi.

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
We've known each other since childhood.

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,120
But now your father angered the Lord of the Mountain.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,840
I never expected this.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Old Jin seemed

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,280
like a decent man outside.

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,360
Who knew his heart was so dark?

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
So filthy inside.

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,480
Even the heavens can't stand it.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,280
You know,

66
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
when Old Jin came to Guandong,

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,760
he married three wives.

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,480
Really?

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Not a single child.

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,120
Darn it.

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,760
All three wives died in the end.

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
The fortune-teller said he doomed wives and kids.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,840
His fate is tough.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
But no matter how tough,

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
he can't beat the heavens.

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,680
You two aren't his real children.

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,760
No one knows where you came from.

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,360
Your Jin Family used the Nine Immortals' Compass to dig up the Ginseng King.

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,480
You've enjoyed wealth too long.

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
This Jin Family,

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,200
is finished now.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Be smart.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,640
Hand over the compass.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,280
Behave.

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
You don't know what's good for you.

86
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,280
Beat them!

87
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Stop hitting, the rest keep searching.

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,920
Stop hitting.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't hit him.

90
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Please, stop hitting.

91
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm begging you, stop.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,040
Please, I'm begging you, stop.

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm begging you.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
I know where the compass is.

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
You bunch of bastards.

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
You don't know restraint.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
No pity for the weak at all.

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,520
What are you doing, Lin Wancheng?

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,280
Sister Xing'er.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,040
You're the sensible one.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Give the compass to Brother Lin.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,080
Brother Lin promises to treat you well.

103
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,560
Lin Wancheng.

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,960
Just let Brother Thirteen go.

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
I'll take you to get the compass.

106
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't trick Brother Lin.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,960
He's still here.

108
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Can't tell him.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Don't tell him.

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,520
Xing'er.

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,680
No!

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,840
Xing'er.

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Xing'er! Xing'er!

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,040
Let go!

115
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,960
Xing'er! Xing'er! Xing'er!

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,960
Xing'er.

117
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Xing'er! Xing'er!

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,520
Let go!

119
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Xing'er.

120
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,680
Release!

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Come.

122
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,520
Don't come closer.

123
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Don't come, Xing'er!

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
Xing'er! Xing'er!

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,960
Qiao San'er.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,520
Don't touch me.

127
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,760
Stay away from my sister.

128
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
Don't run!

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,080
Let go!

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Let me go!

131
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Qiao San'er.

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
Xing'er! Xing'er!

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,200
Hurry up!

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Let me go!

135
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,640
Qiao San'er, I'll kill you!

136
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,080
No!

137
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,520
I like you!

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
Qiao San'er, you scum!

139
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,360
Hurry up!

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
Let me go!

141
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,360
What do you want?

142
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,040
Xing'er.

143
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,080
What's up?

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't want to be alone with me?

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
Or join us all together?

146
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Sure, thanks, Brother San'er.

147
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
Thirteen.

148
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,240
Let’s be siblings in our next life.

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
No.

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,760
No!

151
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
Xing’er.

152
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,760
Xing’er.

153
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
Xing’er.

154
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Buzzkill.

155
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,240
Qiao San! Qiao San!

156
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Lin Wancheng, I’ll kill you!

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,880
Me.

158
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,000
Go! This way. Over there!

159
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
Search over there.

160
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Any treasure left over there?

161
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,120
That box is mine!

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,680
Don’t move.

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
Come here! Come here!

164
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
I saw it first.

165
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Why are you snatching?

166
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Don’t snatch.

167
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,560
Give me this one.

168
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
Why can’t it be mine?

169
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
First come, first served.

170
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,120
There’s treasure here.

171
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,480
Where is it?

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,360
Right here.

173
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Give me a hand.

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,040
Coming, coming.

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
Did you check over there?

176
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Checked. Anything else?

177
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
Hurry up.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Look at this! Look!

179
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,480
What is this?

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,800
Make sure they’re dead.

181
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
Find a place to bury them.

182
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,680
Clean it up.

183
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
Hurry! Hurry!

184
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Move faster, hurry!

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,680
Did you check there?

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Checked, checked.

187
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
San, it’s dug.

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,320
Bury?

189
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,920
Cut the crap.

190
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,560
Bury.

191
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
San, he ran!

192
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,800
He ran.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,480
Chase!

194
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,120
Go!

195
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Kid.

196
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,920
Kid.

197
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,920
Kid!

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,880
Don’t move! Don’t move!

199
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,880
Don’t move.

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,560
You’re badly hurt.

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,320
Come.

202
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Drink some water. Here.

203
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,240
Slow down.

204
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,680
Slowly, slowly.

205
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,120
Slowly, slowly.

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Kid, don’t be afraid.

207
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,160
Meeting me means you’re saved.

208
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,720
Behave.

209
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,920
Let me out.

210
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,560
Behave.

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,800
Let go! Let me out!

212
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,160
Don’t move.

213
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,480
Let go of me.

214
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,240
Let go.

215
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,920
Cut the crap! Let me out!

216
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,800
Behave.

217
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,440
Awake.

218
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,240
Where is this?

219
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,240
You got tricked here by that old man too, right?

220
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
He sold you.

221
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
That old bastard’s tricked so many.

222
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,120
He only tricks our own people.

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
To bleed us for the Rakshasa.

224
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
That old wretch.

225
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,480
He’ll go to hell sooner or later.

226
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
Don’t bother, you can’t get out.

227
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,600
Look at those two.

228
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,920
Honestly, staying here isn’t so bad.

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
Food and shelter are provided.

230
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Sometimes we even get ginseng to boost us.

231
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,240
They just take us out to bleed a little.

232
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
It won’t kill you.

233
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,160
Rakshasa always use blood in their medicine.

234
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,800
Rare, thick blood is the most precious.

235
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,040
Since they go to such lengths,

236
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,480
feeding ginseng to nurture blood,

237
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,120
we can’t escape

238
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
the fate of being drained.

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Let me out! Let me out!

240
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
You devils from hell!

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
You eat flesh and drink blood!

242
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
Let me out! Let me out!

243
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
Why are you yelling? Shut up!

244
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
Why are you yelling? Why are you yelling?

245
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,040
Stop fighting! Stop!

246
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,920
I’m telling you all—

247
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
Shut your mouths!

248
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,920
Yell, yell, yell.

249
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,560
Keep yelling, keep yelling.

250
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,480
Why are you yelling?

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
Are you looking for trouble?

252
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,040
Shut up!

253
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
Trouble.

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Trouble.

255
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
Still singing.

256
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,440
Sing.
