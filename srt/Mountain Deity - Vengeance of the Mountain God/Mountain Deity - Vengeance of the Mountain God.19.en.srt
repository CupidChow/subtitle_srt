1
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,560
It's gone.

2
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,440
Is that Duan Jiuye?

3
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,080
Everything's gone.

4
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,720
How did Duan Jiuye end up like this?

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,520
Duan Jiuye is gone.

6
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,160
Move aside, don't look.

7
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,120
It's gone.

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,040
Duan Jiuye.

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,240
It's over. Come with me.

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,560
Didn't you tell me

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
Jin Shisan lost to Duan Jiuye?

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,240
Then...

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,400
I...

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,800
So who made your Jin Shisan

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,160
just like the hero in a novel?

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
He was killed by villains in one chapter,

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,720
then healed and revived the next.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,240
He slaps and kills the bad guys.

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,880
After all, he's your unbeatable, charming Jin Shisan.

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
Nothing surprises me anymore.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
How did he become mine?

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
We're out on the street.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let me save some face, please.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm leaving.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,160
Where are you going?

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Going home to report to my father.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,240
I haven't seen Jin Shisan.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
As long as he's safe, that's enough.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Why am I worrying for nothing?

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,320
It's all your fault, see?

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,040
I've put all my money into this.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
We agreed on everything before.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm telling you,

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,800
if not for Duan Jiuye,

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
my Lu family had four ginseng shops,

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
now there's only one left.

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,160
The whole family just sits around the shop

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,840
barely getting by on thin porridge.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,720
And also...

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,760
In the Xinyou year,

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,120
Duan Jiuye took our orders from Zhili.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
He made money that year,

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
left my father so angry he coughed blood.

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
Speak up, will you?

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
Why hide things from others?

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
I eat meat, you don't even get soup.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
I bribe the officials,

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
I want what's yours.

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,040
I give gifts to the royals,

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
I want what's yours.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,280
Your guild has been robbed and attacked before.

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
But now, when I mess up,

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,400
everyone's whispering here.

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
Duan Jiuye.

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
You've worked too hard for too long.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
It's hard to always be fair to everyone.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Everyone here

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,480
has some resentment in their hearts.

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,960
That's right, isn't it?

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
But today we're here

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
not to make a scene.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,400
You bought and hoarded ginseng, borrowed money,

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,480
but lost the guild's main stock.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
I touched the main stock,

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
broke the rules.

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
I'll go outside the pass and wait to die.

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,280
This chair—

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
whoever wants it can have it.

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,840
I don't care for it.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,120
Duan Jiuye.

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Give us an explanation.

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Everyone, listen to me.

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Everyone, listen to me.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,560
What's going on? Yeah.

75
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Boss Jin spent money

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
to buy back the guild's main stock for us.

77
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,600
He made up for Duan Jiuye's mistake.

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,560
My Lu family ginseng shop

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,920
is the first to recommend Jin Shisan of the Jin family shop

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,600
as the leader of the Changbai Mountain Ginseng Guild.

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Does everyone agree?

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,760
Agreed! Agreed! Agreed!

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,280
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

84
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,200
Yang family ginseng shop

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,960
nominates Jin Shisan of the Jin family.

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,480
Thank you, everyone.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Jin Shisan.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,960
Thank you.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,920
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

91
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,480
Thank you.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,200
Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan! Jin Shisan!

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Good.

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
Congratulations!

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Good.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,200
Good.

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,040
Good.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Old Duan is on the move.

99
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,560
My men are following him.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,440
He can't escape.

101
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
Remember to leave him alive when you act.

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,880
Right.

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Make him bow to Old Jin before he dies.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,400
I have a few things to ask him myself.

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Let's go.

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,840
Jin Shisan.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,160
If you have things to do tonight,

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,720
we won't bother you.

109
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,040
We'll talk next time.

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
I really can't stand watching this.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
Ever since you came back from Fengtian,

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
you've been avoiding him.

113
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,200
Didn't you have so much to say

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
to Jin Shisan?

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
Now's your chance.

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,760
Jin Shisan, are you mute too?

117
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
I—no, tonight we...

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,320
Shut up.

119
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
Come with me.

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,000
If you have something to do,

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,320
just go.

122
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,280
Don't worry about me.

123
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,440
There is something.

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,880
It's on my mind.

125
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
It's a big deal.

126
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
If it's on your mind,

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
why not say it out loud?

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
Let me help you share the burden.

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
If it's a big deal,

130
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,480
why not ask the Yang family for help?

131
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,000
My father already promised the Yang family would help you.

132
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
I live on the edge, risking my life.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,040
If I make one mistake,

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,400
the Yang family could get dragged in.

135
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm afraid to implicate you.

136
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm not afraid.

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,880
I promised your father I'd protect you for life.

138
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,600
But I'm afraid.

139
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,200
In the end, you do care about me.

140
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
But you don't understand me.

141
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm the second daughter of the Yang family shop.

142
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Whether it's digging ginseng in the mountains

143
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,760
or running the business,

144
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm not inferior to you.

145
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm not some pampered young lady.

146
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,000
I can share the burdens of the one I love.

147
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,960
Ruyi

148
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,440
Don't say anything more.

149
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
During those days in Fengtian, I figured it out.

150
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,040
Jin Shisan, your heart is cold.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,440
I can try my best to warm it up.

152
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,760
Your vengeance, your hatred—

153
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,480
I'll bear them with you.

154
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Because you're the man I've chosen.

155
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,720
Let's talk tomorrow.

156
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,160
Is that okay?

157
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,680
Alright.

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
Then I won't disturb Boss Jin's business.

159
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,760
Ruyi

160
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,120
Tonight—

161
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I only want tonight.

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,280
Maybe tonight all grudges will end.

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
When tomorrow comes,

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,840
maybe I can let everything go.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Then I'll come find you.

166
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,600
I'll have a clear answer in my heart.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,280
Okay.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Jin Shisan

169
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,440
I'll wait for you.

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Duan Jiuye, you won't take the main road,

171
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,160
nor stay at the inn.

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Traveling at night is dangerous.

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Are you stupid?

174
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
So many people are after my head.

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm afraid I'll check in with my head,

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,640
but leave without it.

177
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Keep moving.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,400
Who?

179
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,720
What are you doing? Don't light it!

180
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,040
I told you not to!

181
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,040
Duan Jiuye

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,160
Duan Jiuye

183
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Duan Jiuye

184
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,600
Duan Jiuye

185
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I told you to shut up!

186
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,520
Jin Shisan

187
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
You coward!

188
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Even as a ghost, I won't let you go!

189
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Tell me—how did my father die?

190
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,600
I can give you a quick death.

191
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,600
Your father was just too stubborn.

192
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
He wouldn't let go of The Nine Immortals' Compass.

193
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,480
No wonder your Jin family was wiped out.

194
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,840
Speak!

195
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,840
Seems you only know part

196
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,480
of what happened three years ago.

197
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,080
You don't know the rest.

198
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Back then—

199
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Go!

200
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,600
Hurry!

201
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,840
Duan Jiuye, they didn't follow us.

202
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Let's catch our breath before moving on.

203
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,400
Really.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,720
Your loyalty to me—

205
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,280
I haven't treated you well for nothing.

206
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,720
Duan Jiuye is a true hero.

207
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,160
We're all willing to help you rise again.

208
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,480
Duan Jiuye, maybe we should go back and plan.

209
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,040
Come.

210
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,640
Slow down.

211
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,280
No.

212
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm going back to kill them.

213
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm taking Jin Shisan's damned life!

214
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,160
Duan Jiuye, don't rush.

215
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,720
There's an important guest waiting for you.

216
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,280
What bad luck.

217
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
That bastard Duan Lao Jiu got away.

218
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,280
Shouldn't have wasted words with him.

219
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,160
Should've just—

220
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,960
Sent him down to apologize to Boss Jin in person.

221
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
We still haven't figured out the temple incident.

222
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
He can't die yet.

223
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
If no one had saved him,

224
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,520
he'd have died eight hundred times by now.

225
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,240
The one who took Duan Jiu away—

226
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,040
doesn't want to tangle with us.

227
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,800
Nor do they want a fight.

228
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,720
Doesn't seem like his people.

229
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,840
There must be someone else behind this.

230
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Someone else.

231
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,160
Who could it be?

232
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I don't care who it is.

233
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,840
I'll gather the men right now.

234
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Even if we turn Songling Town upside down,

235
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,960
we'll drag Duan Jiu out.

236
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,640
Uncle Luo

237
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,720
Don't rush.

238
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,720
If someone really helped him,

239
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,960
he's already out of town by now.

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,920
Or maybe he's hiding somewhere.

241
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,040
Brother Jinzi, what do we do now?

242
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,400
Wait.

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,800
Jinzi

244
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,080
Waiting like this won't work.

245
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,160
If that old bastard leaves town,

246
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,080
how will we ever find him?

247
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,720
We have what he wants.

248
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
He won't leave.

249
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
He'll definitely come.

250
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,800
Even if he doesn't,

251
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,040
the one behind him will.
