1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,440
This way.

2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,840
Second Miss, the person is here.

3
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,960
My father is already inside waiting for you.

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,520
Father.

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,080
Jin Shisan greets Yang Ba Ye.

6
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Only outsiders call me Ba Ye.

7
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,560
Your father and I share a bond of life and death.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Calling me Ba Ye feels too distant.

9
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,960
Sit.

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Ba Ye.

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Then how should I address you?

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
Just call me Uncle for now.

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,520
Alright.

14
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,640
Uncle.

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,800
Jin Shisan pays respects to Uncle.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Good.

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Uncle.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,040
About your health...

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,040
I know my own body.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,120
I won't see next year.

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,720
I remember my father once said,

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
using knotweed,

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,160
asarum,

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,440
and blue salt,

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,840
combined with ginseng in medicine,

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,120
can strengthen the body.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
It can cure strange illnesses of energy.

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,360
Only knotweed is hard to find in Songling Town.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
But I recall a small stream on the southern slope.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
At this time of year,

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,080
it should be possible to harvest some.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
I've never been to the southern slope.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm not familiar with it.

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,440
How about this—

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,680
Ruyi,

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
ask your brother to go into the mountains alone.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Let him gather some knotweed.

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
It'll help him practice his skills.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,520
Alright.

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,760
And give us some time alone.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Let me and him talk privately.

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Okay.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,760
You two go ahead and talk.

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
Shisan,

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,440
you've seen it yourself.

46
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,440
My time is almost up.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,080
Before I die, there are two things I can't let go.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,560
I must entrust them to you.

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
Uncle, please tell me.

50
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,840
The first thing—

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,600
is my unmarried daughter.

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm unlucky; my son turned out useless.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,840
Ruyi, as a daughter,

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,760
has weathered storms all these years.

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,760
She has held this family together alone.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
It's not been easy.

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,560
My old bones have burdened her.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
When I'm gone someday,

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm afraid she'll be alone,

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,680
bullied in the Ginseng Guild.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,320
Uncle.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,040
I promise you.

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
The second thing is—

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,840
the same knot in both our hearts.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,480
The Jin family massacre.

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,680
Back then, Old Jin, Duan Laojiu, and I

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,480
were all reckless men in our twenties.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,040
There was a rumor—

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,560
that in Changbai Mountain, there's a Priceless Ginseng King.

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,560
Eat it, and you gain immortality.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,680
Its cave is called the Celestial Grotto.

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Only those with the Nine Immortals' Compass

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
and the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
can find the Ginseng King.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,840
And claim the treasures and immortality within.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,480
The compass has been passed down in the Jin family.

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,200
But the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,320
has never been found by generations of mountain men.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
I never thought you'd uncover it.

80
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
So that's how it is.

81
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
It was all Duan Laojiu's scheme.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
You know everything now.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I just found out myself.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,560
The Celestial Temple three years ago—

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,400
it was all Duan Laojiu's doing.

86
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,760
Not just three years.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Duan Laojiu planned this scheme

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,920
for a full twenty years.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,960
Shisan.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
When you were young,

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
your family had more than

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
just this old house, right?

93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,320
The Jin family were mountain experts.

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
They amassed many treasures and antiques.

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Where did they all go?

96
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,480
Why are you all squeezed into

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
this shabby old house now?

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,280
Uncle, do you know the reason?

99
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Old Jin was too honest, too naive.

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
He didn't have Duan Laojiu's cunning.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,320
The ginseng shop business

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
was ruined and taken by Duan Laojiu.

103
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,160
Half of his current fortune

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,320
was once your Jin family's.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Old leader.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,320
That's all, right?

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
The silver notes have been checked.

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Once handed over, no debts are recognized.

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
That's it. All gone.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,320
Let's go.

111
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Father.

112
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,720
Is something troubling you?

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
Why sigh so deeply?

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,320
You don't know shit.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
This is an ancestral breathing technique.

116
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll teach you later.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
What are you staring at?

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,440
It's mealtime, why aren't you eating?

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
Don't you have a pocket watch?

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
Why ask me the time?

121
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Lost it.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,440
Old Jin was so stubborn.

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
I lent him money to help.

124
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
He just wouldn't accept it.

125
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,720
Duan Laojiu forced him into a corner.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Finally, he showed his true colors.

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
He wanted Old Jin to trade the Nine Immortals' Compass for his property.

128
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Old Jin refused.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,600
And right at that moment,

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,960
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng was rumored to appear.

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
Old Jin returned to the mountains.

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
He wanted to unearth the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

133
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,320
To find the Celestial Grotto and restore his family.

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,600
But none of us expected—

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,320
Duan Laojiu would be so ruthless.

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,720
When he couldn't buy the compass,

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,200
he killed your whole family at the Celestial Temple.

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,040
Uncle.

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
The funny thing is,

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Lin Lao Qi got the Nine Immortals' Compass
for nothing.

141
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,040
The teams sent to the mountain

142
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,880
never found the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,320
The Duan and Lin families are lying low,

144
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
waiting for the right moment.

145
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
I've lived like a coward all this time,

146
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
afraid to avenge the Jin family.

147
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Scared I can't beat Duan Laojiu,

148
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,600
and drag my children down with me.

149
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,440
I've been hiding here for three years.

150
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,720
Enough.

151
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Now that you're back,

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,960
the Yang Ginseng Guild is your support.

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,320
I want to see you avenge the Jin family
before I die.

154
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
Here, Uncle.

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,320
Have some water.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Fresh hot noodle soup, just made.

157
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,280
It's steaming.

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,160
Jin Shisan.

159
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
Just a little thing.

160
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,440
What are you thinking about?

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
You haven't said a word since dinner started.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,600
It's nothing.

163
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Are you free?

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,280
Let's take a walk.

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,720
You two got weird after your talk.

166
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,280
Uncle just told me some old stories,

167
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,440
asked me to look after you.

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
To protect you like a sister.

169
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,600
Like a sister?

170
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,000
Why a sister?

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,680
Is that what you want, or my father's idea?

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,720
Yang Ruyi.

173
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,440
Jin Shisan.

174
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,720
I like you.

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,440
You know that.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,160
I don't have anything else on my mind now.

177
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay.

178
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,200
I understand.

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I like you.

180
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not to make you like me back.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
I just wanted to tell you.

182
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Let's leave it at that.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,960
Let's go our separate ways.

184
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,960
Dad

185
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,400
Jin Shisan is getting closer to the truth.

186
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,640
But Jin Shisan doesn't understand

187
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
Lin Qi Ye, Duan Laojiu

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,640
why your most trusted brother

189
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,840
would want you dead.

190
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,520
In this Ginseng Guild,

191
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,960
what are the real rules?

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
What is true honor?

193
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,360
Dad

194
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,480
I swear

195
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
how Duan Laojiu hurt you back then,

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
I'll make him pay for every bit of it.

197
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,520
Dad

198
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
All these years, you've suffered injustice

199
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
without a chance to clear your name.

200
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,720
Heaven has been unfair to you,

201
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
and to our Jin family.

202
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,160
For you, and for the Jin family,

203
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
Jin Shisan will demand justice from the heavens.

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,160
Jinzi

205
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,720
Baobao

206
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,160
Chief Luo

207
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,960
You're back.

208
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,040
Was there anything fun in the capital?

209
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Did you bring anything tasty

210
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,040
for me and Jin Shisan?

211
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,960
All you think about is food.

212
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,160
We were traveling nonstop, no time for that.

213
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
On my way back from the capital,

214
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,280
I passed by Yejiling.

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,960
I found something strange.

216
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,720
What was it?

217
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
There's a ravine east of Yejiling.

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,160
I found a pile of white bones there.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,240
Looks like they've been dead a long time.

220
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Bones?

221
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
All human skeletons.

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
There were seven or eight in total.

223
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280
That's creepy.

224
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,600
Chief Luo,

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
I'll get a fire basin ready for you.

226
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,520
Jump over it

227
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,280
to ward off bad luck.

228
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
That forest is thick.

229
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,840
Few ginseng pickers go in there.

230
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
If I hadn't taken a shortcut this time,

231
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,040
cutting through the middle,

232
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
I wouldn't have found it at all.

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,160
In that forest,

234
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,280
there aren't any wild beasts, right?

235
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,280
This seems suspicious.

236
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,800
Baobao,

237
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,040
tell the Blood Servant brothers

238
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
to stay alert these days.

239
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,600
Uncle Luo,

240
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,640
thanks for making the trip.

241
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,480
It was hard on you.

242
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
No need to be polite.

243
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,400
It's just a trip.

244
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,280
No big deal.

245
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
For the Jin family,

246
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
for the chief,

247
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,160
anything is worth doing.

248
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,840
There's one more thing,

249
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll need you to make another trip.

250
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,400
Just tell me where to go.

251
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,400
I'll head out right away.

252
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
No rush, no rush.

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
A couple days ago,

254
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
I sent Haiyue back home.

255
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,040
She should be back today.

256
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,160
Let's wait for her and discuss together.

257
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,160
Alright.

258
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Brother Jin,

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,400
when will Haiyue be back?

260
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
She's been gone for days.

261
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,160
Is she coming back today?

262
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,840
You miss her, don't you?

263
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
I don't miss her.

264
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
Why would I miss her?

265
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,160
I, uh...

266
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm just worried she'll delay your business.

267
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
Jin Shisan,

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm back!

269
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,040
Haiyue!

270
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,960
Help me with this.

271
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,720
Why do you only call Jin Shisan, not me?

272
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,160
Look,

273
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,160
you've lost weight.

274
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,840
Jin Shisan,

275
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,600
let me tell you,

276
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,400
I closed a big deal this time.

277
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,840
Glad it went smoothly.

278
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,720
Haiyue is really impressive.

279
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,400
By the way,

280
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
I brought you some snacks from the capital.

281
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,600
Put them away quickly.

282
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
Don't let that kid eat them all.

283
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,160
Wait—

284
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
Brother Luo, that's not fair.

285
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
You give her treats, not me?

286
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Here, here, here—take some.

287
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,720
I knew you were a foodie.

288
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
Alright, alright, alright.

289
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,720
Your Uncle Luo

290
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
just got back from the capital.

291
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,600
He brought you treats

292
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,840
and lots of fun stories.

293
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,640
Let him tell you about it.

294
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,960
The capital is lively.

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,920
Roast duck is popular there.

296
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,960
They roast the duck in an oven.

297
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
Then slice it after roasting.

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
Dip the slices in sauce.

299
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
Wrap it in a pancake after dipping.

300
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,160
The taste—

301
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,600
not as good as our smoked meat pancakes.

302
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,720
Chief Luo,

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
I heard there's something called douzhi in the capital.

304
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,280
It's like our tofu here,

305
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,160
but left to spoil.

306
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
It turns into a liquid.

307
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
It's really sour.

308
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
No, no, no, that's awful.

309
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,040
Really, it's terrible.

310
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,840
Let me tell you,

311
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
Miss Yang still hasn't changed

312
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,240
her habit of peeking at people.

313
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,960
There's a treat called "Rolling Donkey," soft and sweet.

314
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm telling you,

315
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
When will you start calling me Ruyi?

316
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Come sit inside.

317
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,720
No need.

318
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
I just came to tell you

319
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
I'll be heading to Fengtian in a few days.

320
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
To handle some Ginseng Shop business.

321
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,040
How long will you be gone?

322
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,800
Can't bear to see me leave?

323
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,920
I'll be quick, back soon.

324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,640
You're still recovering.

325
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
Don't overwork yourself.

326
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,720
Not bad,

327
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
you've learned to care for others.

328
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,160
Jin Shisan,

329
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,160
wait for me to return.

330
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,280
Duan Laojiu

331
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
This is our Ginseng Guild's
account book for this month.

332
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,960
Eun Hee

333
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,080
About this bonsai here,

334
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,600
it needs trimming
from time to time.

335
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
That way, it won't
grow crooked.

336
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,160
What a pity.

337
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
This one grew crooked.

338
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,480
The whole pot is ruined.

339
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,400
Take it out.

340
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,920
Throw it away.

341
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,840
Yes.

342
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Duan Laojiu, you truly
have a sharp eye.

343
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,840
How are those Ginseng Guilds
in Fengtian lately?

344
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,160
Ever since Liuhe Tang
and Jin Shisan

345
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,040
opened ten Ginseng Guilds
in Fengtian,

346
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,040
it's had quite an impact
on our business.

347
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,040
And with Liuhe Tang backing them,

348
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
many ginseng suppliers
who worked with us

349
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,040
now switched to
working with Jin Shisan.

350
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,360
This branch is crooked too.

351
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,720
Duan Laojiu,

352
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,640
I heard that lately,
Jin Shisan

353
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
landed a big order.

354
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,160
All his Ginseng Guilds

355
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,720
are buying wild ginseng
in bulk.

356
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
And they're offering
above market price,

357
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,480
paying twenty percent more.

358
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,600
Choi Haiyue even went back
to Joseon

359
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
just for this ginseng deal.

360
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,040
Then we should help

361
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,080
this promising young
Boss Jin.
