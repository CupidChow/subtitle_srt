1
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,400
Three days from now is my father's memorial.

2
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,520
I came here today

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,800
to reclaim what belongs to the Jin family.

4
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,160
Careful.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's go.

6
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,160
Sister.

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Your brother is here to see you.

8
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,160
Today, I

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
avenged you.

10
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
Tell Father down there

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
that those who hurt you back then,

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,440
I will drag out every last one of them.

13
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,160
No one will escape.

14
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
That bastard Qiao San'er—

15
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,280
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

16
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,920
I wish I could cut him to pieces.

17
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
You all are useless too.

18
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
You even lost track of a living man.

19
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,120
Is that all you're good for?

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I'll take my men right now

21
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
and turn Songling Town upside down

22
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,040
just to find Jin Shisan.

23
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,760
I don't believe it.

24
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,640
He can't be harder to find than the Seven Fairy Ginseng.

25
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,000
What's the point of finding him?

26
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,200
Can you use your brain for once?

27
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
Losing the compass is nothing.

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
The real priority is the Seven Fairy Ginseng.

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,360
The Grand Mountain Assembly in three days—

30
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040
if we can't present it,

31
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
then Liuhe Tang

32
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,040
will want our heads as compensation.

33
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Today, Seventh Master lost face

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
in a big way.

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,560
When a man is in power,

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,040
he must learn to restrain himself.

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,840
As they say, pride comes before a fall.

38
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,040
Too much leads to reversal.

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,560
He flaunts the Nine Immortals' Compass

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,280
and has stolen so much business.

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,400
Songling alone isn't enough for him.

42
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,640
Now he's reaching into the capital.

43
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,560
But now he's lost the compass.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
That Liuhe Tang deal

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
he probably can't deliver.

46
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
We

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
don't need to rush.

48
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,200
He already took the deposit.

49
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Liuhe Tang's money is easy to take,

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
but not so easy to return.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,200
When he can't clean up the mess,

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
that's when we step in.

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,680
I want Liuhe Tang to learn a lesson.

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,480
One foot

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,040
can only stand on one boat.

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
The Nine Immortals' Compass—

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,200
it's safest in our own hands.

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,200
Jin Shisan won't let this go.

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,480
He'll find a way to get revenge.

60
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,760
To succeed,

61
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,960
we'll need help from others.

62
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,480
Father.

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,080
That's what happened.

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,360
I was wrong.

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm not skilled enough.

66
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,760
I only bring you shame.

67
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,760
Father, my brother meant well.

68
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,240
He was just tricked.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
He made a mistake.

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,480
He can't get things done,

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,080
but he sure can mess them up.

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,080
From now on, let Ru Yi handle the business.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,200
You stay out of it.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,800
Father.

75
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,240
Get out.

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Tingxuan.

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Nephew.

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Young Master Yang.

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Uncle.

80
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Jiu'er, serve Young Master Yang some tea.

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,200
Young Master Yang, please have some tea.

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Thank you, thank you.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
Tingxuan is truly outstanding.

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,640
And he's earned Eighth Master's trust.

85
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,640
Eighth Master is truly blessed.

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
How has my Eighth Brother been lately?

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,360
Uncle.

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
I came today

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
to discuss with you

90
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
the matter of the Nine Immortals' Compass.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Jin Shisan is completely lawless.

92
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
He snatched the compass in front of all the merchants today.

93
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
He doesn't respect the Ginseng Guild at all.

94
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
You're absolutely right.

95
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
The Nine Immortals' Compass is our guild's symbol.

96
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
It's also our guild's honor.

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,240
The Yang family is the leader of the Changbai Ginseng Guild.

98
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
This Jin Shisan—

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,080
he's brought the fight to our doorstep.

100
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,680
Uncle.

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
I know you've always cared little for fame or fortune.

102
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
But now, Russia and Korea

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,800
are eyeing the ginseng trade hungrily.

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
The Grand Mountain Assembly is in three days.

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
Our Changbai Ginseng Guild

106
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
must dig up the King of Ginseng.

107
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
We're all getting old.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,240
We can't keep up anymore.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,080
The future belongs to you young people.

110
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Our guild

111
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,120
still needs your strong support.

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
For the sake of the guild,

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,240
would you help me reclaim the compass?

114
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Since you have ambition,

115
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,240
I, Duan, will give you my full support.

116
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,960
Thank you, Uncle.

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
Brother Jinzi,

118
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
now that we have the sacred compass,

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
what should we do next?

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
After what happened today,

121
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
we're out in the open now.

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,680
We're exposed,

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,120
while they're in the shadows.

124
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,560
We're outnumbered.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,920
The power gap is huge.

126
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
We can't win head-to-head.

127
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,560
Looks like we'll have to give them a small concession.

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Uncle Luo

129
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,040
Jin Shisan dares to ask you for something.

130
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,080
Get up.

131
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
Kid, let me tell you something.

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
A man's knees are worth gold.

133
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Kneel only to heaven, earth, and parents.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,360
Never kneel for anything else.

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,800
Come on, get up.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,960
Whatever you need, just say it.

137
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,840
Uncle Luo

138
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
If I remember correctly,

139
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
my father's Seven Fairy Ginseng

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,280
was given to you, right?

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
I'd like to borrow it for a while.

142
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
That was always your Jin family's.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,360
Back then, your father was so righteous.

144
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
The Jade King of Guandong offered ten thousand yuan

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
to buy this ginseng.

146
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
But your father knew my mother was gravely ill,

147
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
so he gave it to me.

148
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Sadly,

149
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
my mother didn't live to see this life-saving ginseng.

150
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,120
She passed away.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
This wild ginseng

152
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,160
I hid it in a secret cave at Yejiling.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Waiting for the day I could return it to your Jin family.

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Thank you, Uncle Luo.

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,800
Baobao

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
I'll leave this matter to you.

157
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,680
Me?

158
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Those blood slave brothers we saved before—

159
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,560
You've kept in touch with them.

160
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,600
Find two unfamiliar faces.

161
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Preferably with a bit of a regional accent.

162
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,240
Don't worry, Jinzi.

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,920
Those of us who made it out alive

164
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
are all deeply grateful to you.

165
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,800
If you ever need anything,

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
we won't hesitate.

167
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,360
Alright.

168
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Tomorrow, have them bring the Seven Fairy Ginseng

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,480
to Lin's Ginseng Shop for business.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,120
Okay.

171
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
Call out your manager.

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
There's a big deal.

173
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,160
Lin's Ginseng Shop thinks we're too small and poor.

174
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,720
They don't want to do business with us.

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
Wait a moment.

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Young master.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,480
What are you two saying?

178
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
We welcome all business.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,040
If it's a Bodhisattva, we offer incense.

180
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,120
Turns out the true Buddha is here.

181
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,880
We'll take this ginseng.

182
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,600
I'll take my leave now.

183
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
Farewell.

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,360
It looks... looks

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
like the one Jin Buhuan dug up years ago.

186
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,880
Father.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Heaven hasn't abandoned our Lin family.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,000
But why did this ginseng come so easily?

189
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,240
Something's up, right?

190
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Easy? Not at all.

191
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
To get this ginseng,

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I went through hell.

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
Dad, stop being so suspicious.

194
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
It just means our Lin family is truly blessed.

195
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
Protected by the gods themselves.

196
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,560
Right now, the urgent thing

197
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
is to deliver the goods to Liuhe Tang.

198
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
Ever since we lost the Nine Immortals' Compass,

199
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,920
we've lost many clients.

200
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
We need to restore our reputation fast.

201
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,240
Go, inform Liuhe Tang.

202
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
We'll deliver tonight.

203
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,240
You go in person.

204
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
Alright.

205
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,680
I've long heard of Mr. Haitang's fame.

206
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,720
My father's birthday banquet that night must've amused you.

207
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,560
By the way—

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,120
When will you perform in Songling Town?

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,920
Our Lin family will book eight shows first

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
to show our sincerity.

211
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Boss He has been waiting for a while.

212
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Boss Lin, please.

213
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,800
Boss He.

214
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
Haven't seen you these past two days.

215
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
You look well.

216
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,920
No need for small talk.

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,040
I must rush back to the capital tonight.

218
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Open the box and check the goods.

219
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
I didn't expect this.

220
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
The renowned Lin's Ginseng Shop

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,040
dares to use fake goods to cheat people.

222
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,160
A bastard

223
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,800
who doesn't even know his own father.

224
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,680
You don't know shit!

225
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
This isn't your place to speak.

226
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,120
Someone!

227
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,040
Throw him out!

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,360
Boss He.

229
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
This Seven Fairy Ginseng

230
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
was picked by my father alone.

231
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
Everyone knows

232
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,680
there's only one in the world.

233
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,920
No second exists anywhere.

234
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,040
Where's the real ginseng?

235
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
I just handed it to Boss He myself.

236
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,480
With Boss He's sharp eye, he wouldn't mistake it.

237
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,160
Then this ginseng must be fake.

238
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,720
Boss He.

239
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
The matter is settled.

240
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
I won't disturb you further.

241
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,560
Farewell.

242
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,560
Boss He.

243
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,880
This is definitely the real Seven Fairy Ginseng.

244
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
My father saw it too.

245
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,560
It can't be fake.

246
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Boss Lin.

247
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
To be honest with you,

248
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
I don't really care

249
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
if yours is real or fake.

250
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,120
Because I already have a real one.

251
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,160
If yours is real,

252
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,680
burn it now.

253
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,680
Then mine will be the only one in the world.

254
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,120
It'll be worth even more.

255
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,240
So yours must be fake.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
Since it's fake,

257
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,120
I can't let you leave here alive.

258
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,120
Everyone must know

259
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,240
what happens to those who fool Liuhe Tang.

260
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
No, no, no!

261
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,440
Boss He!

262
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,360
Boss He, please don't!

263
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,040
Boss He, please don't!

264
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,480
Mine is the real Seven Fairy Ginseng! Help!

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
Boss He, please don't!

266
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,920
Boss He, please don't! Boss He!

267
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
Boss He!

268
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Drag him out and drown him.

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Yes.

270
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Boss He, behave yourself.

271
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,360
No! Boss He! Go!

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Help! Help! Boss He!

273
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Behave yourself.

274
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
Master, Master

275
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,000
Why are you panicking?

276
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Speak.

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Liuhe Tang has always been ruthless.

278
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Once they make a move,

279
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,800
they never leave anyone alive.

280
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,680
Take a few skilled men

281
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,120
and go out the side door, quick.

282
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,440
Where do you think you're going?

283
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,560
Run! Hurry!

284
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,320
Boss Lin

285
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
It's so late.

286
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Where are you heading at this hour?
