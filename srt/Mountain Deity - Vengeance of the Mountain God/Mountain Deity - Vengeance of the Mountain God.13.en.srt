1
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,480
That one from the Jin family,

2
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,680
you're not worthy of this plaque.

3
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,040
Boss Wu,

4
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,600
can't you handle losing?

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,160
Boss Wu, do you have something to say?

6
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,480
That Jin brat,

7
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,720
isn't worthy of this plaque.

8
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Boss Wu,

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,160
calm down.

10
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,600
The prized ginseng decides the winner.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,120
It's a rule passed down by our Ginseng Guild founder.

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,760
So Ginseng Guild members must follow the code.

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Winning or losing isn't shameful.

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,280
As soon as that Jin brat showed up,

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,040
he caused chaos at the Lin family's banquet.

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,160
Not long after,

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,920
the Lin father and son met their end.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,600
What I can't figure out is,

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,240
all of the Lin family's assets

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,440
ended up under the Jin family's control.

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
Isn't this murder for profit?

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,280
Doesn't this break the Guild Code?

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,160
Yeah, how could this happen?

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
The Guild Code is clear:

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,080
if any member commits murder or theft,

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
it's a grave betrayal.

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
Punishable by death.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,080
Boss Jin,

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,760
maybe there's some misunderstanding here.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Why not explain things to everyone?

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,440
Clear your name.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
I have nothing to say.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,080
A life for a life.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
The Lin father and son died mysteriously.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
This Jin kid

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,520
must give everyone an explanation.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
Right, yes, that's right.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,120
Give us an explanation, give us one!

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
The Guild Code won't tolerate him.

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
The Lord of the Mountain won't tolerate him either.

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,200
Years ago, the Jin family angered the Lord of the Mountain.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,480
Because of that, all these years

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
we've never found any big ginseng roots.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
Now the Jin heir wants to join the Ginseng Guild.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
He'll anger the Lord of the Mountain again.

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,560
He might drag our whole Ginseng Guild,

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
every last one of us, down with him.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Duan Jiuye,

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,360
we can't keep that Jin brat here.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,040
He can't stay, he mustn't stay.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,000
He mustn't stay.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
He mustn't stay.

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,040
Back then, Lin Wancheng tried to kill my brother Jin Zi.

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,840
He disgraced and drove his sister to her death.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
None of you said a word.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,840
Now you talk about the Guild Code.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
You've twisted every word to suit yourselves.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Young man,

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,400
watch what you say.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,640
The Lord of the Mountain punished the Jin family back then.

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
Now, anyone who helps the Jin family

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,120
will anger the Lord of the Mountain.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,640
The fate of the Jin family's remnant is none of our concern.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,760
Duan Jiuye,

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
don't bother with him.

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,480
Someone,

67
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,360
take him away.

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
I'd like to see who dares.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,200
Boss Jin is a benefactor to the Yang family.

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,920
Within this Ginseng Guild,

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
anyone who dares touch Boss Jin

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,040
must get the Yang family's approval first.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Fine.

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,920
So the Jin family

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,640
wants to go against our entire Ginseng Guild?

76
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Yeah, that's right.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,920
That's how I see it.

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,640
Elders,

79
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,360
you always bring up the Lord of the Mountain's wrath

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,120
every chance you get.

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,640
But think about it,

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,400
if the Lord of the Mountain truly rejected the Jin family,

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,640
why did he bless Boss Jin

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,560
to find the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Is it really the Lord of the Mountain who can't accept the Jin family,

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
or is it you who can't accept him?

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
Young Master Yang

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Young Master Yang

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,360
Young Master Yang

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Young Master Yang

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,760
What's going on?

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,640
Something big happened.

93
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,480
It's serious.

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Why are you panicking?

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Just tell me.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,040
Something major happened at the Ginseng King Gathering.

97
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
All the ginseng shops in town know.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Jin Shisan found the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng, right?

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,400
Are you a sage or something?

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
You even knew that?

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
Either say something useful,

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
or go get me another pot of wine.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,280
No, that's not it.

104
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,920
So you know about your second miss too?

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
My sister?

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,360
She probably dug up some big worthless ginseng.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,280
Seems she's more capable than her brother.

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
So, what happened?

109
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,680
Who won?

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Was it the Yangs or the Jins?

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,760
Your second miss showed up with worthless ginseng.

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
The Yang family lost a lot of face this time.

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,960
What?

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm not finished yet.

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
The Ginseng Guild wants to settle the Lin family's murder.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
They all want Jin Shisan dead.

117
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,240
And take the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Yang family's second miss tried to protect Jin Shisan.

119
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
She used the Yang family name

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,960
and became enemies with the whole Ginseng Guild.

121
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,960
You, you—

122
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,840
Your clothes—

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
What are you doing?

124
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,800
We're all family here.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng appeared.

126
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,520
That's a day worth celebrating.

127
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Let's all calm down.

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
No need to get so worked up.

129
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,280
Boss Jin,

130
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,680
just tell everyone exactly what happened.

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,920
What really went on?

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
About the death of Lin Qiye's whole family,

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
and how you took over the Lin family's assets.

134
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,080
If none of this is true,

135
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,840
let's have a drink and call it even.

136
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
We'll wipe the slate clean.

137
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,480
But if you did kill them,

138
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
I'll have to follow the Guild Code.

139
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
You'll be beaten to death.

140
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
And the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng goes to the guild.

141
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,400
What does everyone think?

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
Duan Jiuye is fair

143
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,560
and makes clear judgments.

144
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,520
That's reasonable.

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
Of course I'm being framed.

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,920
But I have no proof.

147
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
None of you believe me.

148
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,520
How about this—

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll leave the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng with the guild for now.

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
In three days,

151
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
I'll find

152
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,080
evidence that convinces everyone.

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,960
That's straightforward.

154
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,640
But what if you can't produce it then?

155
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,520
The ginseng goes to the guild.

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,280
And you can do as you wish with me.

157
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,400
Then, in front of our founder,

158
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
it's a deal.

159
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
It's a deal.

160
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,680
It's a deal, it's a deal, it's a deal.

161
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,520
Look over there.

162
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,480
It's pitch black.

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Must be the bandits' lair.

164
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,960
Let me go and kill them.

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,960
I'll wipe them out completely.

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
Alright, alright.

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,680
Have some tea to soothe your throat, Jiuye.

168
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,120
Jiuye.

169
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Your methods are still the sharpest.

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
You won't let go of the Lin family case.

171
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Jin Shisan will never recover now.

172
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,400
Jiuye is like an old spirit in our northern woods,

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,040
a thousand-year-old monkey turned wise.

174
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
That little Jin brat,

175
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,360
no matter how he jumps, can't become wise.

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,840
He can't escape Jiuye's mystical power.

177
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Wu, have some tea too.

178
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,840
If you can't speak well, don't speak.

179
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,680
Don't flatter and end up embarrassing yourself.

180
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I—uh—

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Wu,

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Sit, sit.

183
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,400
Eunhee, you don't know this—

184
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,240
Wu never went to school.

185
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,480
He doesn't play mind games.

186
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,760
But he's truly loyal to me.

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
You two are both dear to me.

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Jiuye.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,680
This time, the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is in the guild's vault.

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
Which means it's in your pocket, Jiuye.

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
In three days, Jin Shisan will be executed.

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
Then the Nine Immortals' Compass will be yours too.

193
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
That's the first thing.

194
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,040
Watch Jin Shisan closely for the next three days.

195
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
Don't give him any chance to turn things around.

196
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,800
And the second thing—

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
In three days, the guild will put Jin Shisan on trial.

198
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,960
Use this chance to storm the Jin family.

199
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
Seize the Nine Immortals' Compass.

200
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,360
Don't let it slip away like three years ago.

201
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,520
Like how the Lin family got away.

202
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
Follow Jiuye's orders.

203
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,640
By the way—

204
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,680
The Yangs want to protect Jin.

205
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,120
Should we let them?

206
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,120
The Yang family's second miss isn't in charge.

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,040
Yang Baye isn't opposing the whole town.

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
He doesn't have the guts for that.

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,120
No need to worry.

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,360
Dad

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,240
You can't just let my sister

212
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
keep acting out like this.

213
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,560
She even took a worthless ginseng

214
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
to the Ginseng King Gathering and embarrassed us.

215
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
And now, look at this—

216
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
she's angered everyone in the Ginseng Guild

217
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,560
just to back Jin Shisan.

218
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
She’s dragging our Yang family into this mess.

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Now the whole town is laughing at us.

220
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,480
How can our Yang Ginseng Shop

221
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
ever survive in Songling Town after this?

222
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,240
Dad,

223
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
please, say something!

224
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,920
I'm done.

225
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
You need to make a decision.

226
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,600
If you’re done, get out.

227
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,920
Wait—

228
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,680
Dad,

229
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,360
this—

230
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Get out!

231
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Why?

232
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm this sick,

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,680
I can't deal with you and Duan Jiuye’s nonsense.

234
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,040
All those petty problems.

235
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Just because I ignore it doesn't mean I don't know.

236
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,120
Back then, Duan Jiuye and I dug for ginseng

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,120
risking our lives in the mountains.

238
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
That’s how we built this family business.

239
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
You little brat,

240
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
you’ve ruined my reputation.

241
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,360
Get out!

242
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm back.

243
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Got yelled at again.

244
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,480
Dad,

245
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
look what treasure I brought you.

246
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Nice.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,720
Phoenix’s Single Tear turned into a worthless ginseng.

248
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
Keep your wealth hidden.

249
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,920
No one will target our Yang family.

250
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
My child,

251
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
you’re thoughtful.

252
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
It’s all thanks to your father’s teaching.

253
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,880
Brother Jinzi,

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,920
Brother Jinzi,

255
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
I—I—

256
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,800
What are you doing?

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,360
Can’t you see?

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,920
Chopping wood.

259
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
Making a fire to cook.

260
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,920
We only have three days left.

261
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
Hurry and find some evidence.

262
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Otherwise, the two of us

263
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
will get eaten alive by them.

264
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,720
I can't help it either.

265
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,360
Besides,

266
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Old Lin really died right in front of us.

267
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,680
Is it dirty or not?

268
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,320
Is it dirty or not?

269
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,040
Brother,

270
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
You shouldn’t say things like that.

271
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Walls have ears.

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
What if someone overhears?

273
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,360
Got it!

274
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,800
Tonight,

275
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
we’re having braised ribs.

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
Darn it.

277
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
We agreed to work a few more days.

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
You work a few more days, then find someone else.

279
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,680
Why are you—

280
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,720
There’s no future following you guys.

281
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,480
Kicking me when I’m down.

282
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,120
What’s wrong?

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,040
It’s only been a day or two,

284
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,800
and rumors about you are all over town.

285
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
Good thing you didn’t go to the Ginseng King Gathering.

286
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,040
It was way too dangerous.

287
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,240
Blood was spilled at the slightest move.

288
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
If you’d gone with your small frame,

289
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
you’d be gone in a snap.

290
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,800
I’d have to look after you too.

291
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,600
Is this really the time for jokes?

292
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
All you’re good at is talking.

293
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,600
Where’s Brother Shisan?

294
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,480
The three-day deadline is almost up.

295
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,240
He’s just been sitting there.

296
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,040
Brother Luo is missing again.

297
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,440
I’m the only one worrying.

298
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
It’s like the emperor’s calm but the eunuch’s panicking.

299
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,480
No way.

300
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
I’ll go ask Sister Ruyi for advice.

301
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Report to Steward Cui.

302
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Jin Shisan is still the same.

303
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
What is he plotting?

304
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,560
Keep watching him.

305
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,560
Report back anytime.

306
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,560
Yes.

307
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,600
Where is he?

308
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,560
No idea.

309
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Can’t see from your side either?

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,480
Who is it?

311
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,680
It’s late at night.

312
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,040
Can’t people get some sleep?

313
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Haiyue.

314
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Haiyue.

315
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,560
Miss Yang the Second.

316
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,360
Keep your voice down.

317
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,320
We’re here to save you.

318
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,680
You won’t survive the Ginseng Guild meeting tomorrow.

319
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,040
Haiyue and I have already come up with a plan for you.

320
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,920
Come with us, quick.

321
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,920
Change your clothes first.

322
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,240
What are you doing?

323
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,040
Where are we going?

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,240
Wait—

325
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,720
What are you two up to at this hour?

326
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,360
My family happens to have business with Korea.

327
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,360
You two will disguise yourselves as ginseng buyers.

328
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,000
Blend in with our trade caravan.

329
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Once you reach Korea,

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
I’ve arranged for someone to meet you at the post station.

331
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
You’ll quietly leave the caravan.

332
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Then hide out in Pyongyang.

333
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,800
I can’t leave.

334
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,360
Right.

335
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,480
I won’t leave either.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,240
At the very least,

337
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,800
we should steal back the Divine Dragon’s Twin-Incense Ginseng.

338
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,360
Brother Jin risked his life for it.

339
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,800
We can’t just let them have it.

340
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,880
Foolish.

341
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,240
Baobao,

342
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,000
You’ll go but never come back alive.

343
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,600
Miss Yang the Second,

344
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
I appreciate you and Haiyue’s kindness.

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,680
But I can’t leave.

346
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,480
My father’s murder

347
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
is a hatred that cannot coexist.

348
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
Our ancestors left us teachings.

349
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,360
We must follow them.

350
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,240
Honor the Lord of the Mountain.

351
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
Blessings to all.

352
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,800
Greed and anger cloud judgment.

353
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,360
Heaven and earth will not allow it.

354
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
Jin Shisan.

355
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll give you one more chance.

356
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,600
Were you behind the Lin family's massacre?

357
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
No comment.

358
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
You promised everyone in the Guild.

359
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
To show proof in three days.

360
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,120
Do you have it today?

361
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,040
No.

362
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Kill! Kill! Kill!
