1
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,080
Cigarettes, matches.

2
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,200
Thank you, boss.

3
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Take care, sir.

4
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,880
Cigarettes, matches.

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
Selling cigarettes here!

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
Haiyue.

7
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Pastries.

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,760
Crispy and sweet pastries.

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,360
How about it?

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,920
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,080
Come and have a taste!

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,120
Boss, take a look at my ginseng.

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,760
Boss, I need your help this time.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,480
Please be careful with the goods during transport.

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,320
Sure, sure, don't worry.

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,440
Thank you, boss.

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,120
Thank you, boss.

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Thank you, boss.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
I think...

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
Jinzi is taking too big a risk this time.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,600
He agreed to Liuhe Tang's deal right away.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
There are only three days left.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
What if we can't deliver on time?

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't jinx it.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm jinxing it?

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,800
This time, Jinzi raised the market price

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,160
by twenty percent over the original.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,640
Those merchants

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,120
will definitely sell their ginseng to us.

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
All of Songling Town,

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
plus our supply from Korea,

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,280
we'll surely gather enough ginseng on time.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,480
That's right.

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,480
If we pull off this deal,

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
then our Jin Ginseng House in Songling Town

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,560
will outshine Duan and Yang Ginseng Houses.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
They'll all be beneath us.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
They'll all be beneath us.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
I've always been

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
watching their every move.

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,000
You did well this time.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Yes.

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
Keep watching them.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,920
Don't let them notice.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,920
Jiuye.

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll be going now.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Manager Cui is here.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
What's happening in Fengtian?

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Liuhe Tang is negotiating with the foreigners.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,680
They're planning to build a modern factory.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,440
They'll use machines to produce ginseng.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
The factory will be in Fengtian.

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,560
Jin Shisan signed a contract with Liuhe Tang.

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,240
That's seventy percent of Songling Town's ginseng.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
Delivery is due in three days.

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,080
Now, all of Guandong

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,520
has ninety percent of its ginseng in Songling Town.

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,280
And forty percent of Songling Town's ginseng is with us, Duan Ginseng House.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
Jin Shisan is out there

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
buying ginseng at forty percent above market price.

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,680
He's collecting ginseng everywhere.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
He doesn't have that much cash.

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,680
He mortgaged the entire Jin Ginseng House

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,680
to the bank and the money house.

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,960
So young, just like his father.

66
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,440
Neither of them are cut out for business.

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Duan Jiuye.

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
Our Duan Ginseng House's ginseng—

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
Should we sell it to him at a high price too?

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Notify all ginseng suppliers wanting to work with Duan Ginseng House.

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,680
I'll buy ginseng at fifty percent above market price.

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,080
I want to see what Jin Shisan

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,160
can possibly deliver to Liuhe Tang.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,960
Duan Jiuye.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,320
If Jin Shisan can't deliver on time,

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,080
Liuhe Tang won't even need to act.

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,680
The banks and money houses

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,440
will eat him alive, leaving nothing behind.

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Look at this plump crown.

80
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,240
The lines and grooves are clear.

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Excellent quality.

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
When it comes to judging ginseng,

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
around here,

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Boss Jin, you're the top expert.

85
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
The ginseng sent to your house

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
is always the finest wild ginseng.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,800
From now on,

88
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,240
anything good, just send it over.

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
However much you send,

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll buy it all.

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,080
Boss Jin.

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,800
Rest assured.

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,240
Besides my family,

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,080
the Qi, Liang, and Li families—

95
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,320
I've spoken to all of them.

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
We Mountain Ginseng Gatherers

97
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
aren't that skilled,

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,240
but we're united.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,400
By the way, Boss Jin—

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,880
We've arranged to deliver the goods to you.

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
How about the payment?

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,320
Wasn't the price already agreed?

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Boss Jin.

104
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,600
You know as well as I do,

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
we Mountain Ginseng Gatherers

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,600
risk our lives digging in the dirt to survive.

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,880
Please show us some understanding.

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
We're just poor folks.

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
And there are others

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
offering even higher prices to buy.

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Brother Liu.

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm offering forty percent above market price.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,880
I can go up to fifty percent too.

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,880
Duan Jiuye.

115
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,040
Boss Jin is here.

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
Liu Datou—

117
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,680
You little rascal.

118
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,680
My accountant has your silver notes ready.

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Why haven't you picked them up?

120
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
What are you showing off here for?

121
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Do you even know what fifty percent above market price

122
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
actually means?

123
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,120
I know.

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
If you don't want it, I'll find someone else.

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,400
No, no, don't!

126
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Thank you, Duan Jiuye, for your generosity.

127
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
We Mountain Ginseng Gatherers

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,320
are united.

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
My family, Qi family, and Liang family—

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
will deliver wild ginseng to your house tomorrow.

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
Boss Jin, it's all just business.

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,840
Don't take it personally.

133
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,720
Just joking.

134
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Farewell.

135
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,840
Farewell.

136
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Boss Jin.

137
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
Long time no see.

138
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,800
I've missed you.

139
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Duan Jiuye, it's truly been a while.

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,160
Since we parted at the last Mountain Gathering,

141
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,560
I've really missed you.

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,120
About what happened last time—

143
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
I was worried you'd hold a grudge.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,400
So I didn't dare come see you.

145
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,840
Before our founder,

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
didn't we already

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,840
make a gentleman's agreement?

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
The Mountain Gathering is in the past.

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,440
Boss Jin.

150
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
So young,

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
yet generous and kind.

152
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,000
Just like Old Master back in the day.

153
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
It's moving.

154
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,000
My father taught me well.

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
He said,

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,960
when dealing with people,

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
it's like digging for ginseng.

158
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
You can't be too ruthless digging ginseng.

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
Same with people—

160
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
don't go too far in your actions.

161
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,520
That's right.

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Except for two things.

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Which two?

164
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,600
Punish the wicked without mercy.

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
Eradicate evil completely.

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
Your father taught you that?

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
I said it myself.

168
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
Well said.

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,000
Sharp tongue.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
The young are truly impressive.

171
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,080
Boss Jin, so young now,

172
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
and already doing great business.

173
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,520
Even Liuhe Tang recognizes you.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,720
Look at what you've achieved.

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,600
If your father knew,

176
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,120
how well you're doing now,

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
he could rest in peace in the afterlife.

178
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Don't you have a pocket watch?

179
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,120
Why ask me the time?

180
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Lost it.

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,960
Seeing it reminds me of someone.

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,840
Boss Jin.

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Why do you look so pale?

184
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,520
I'm sick.

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,720
It's nothing.

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
Seeing your watch

187
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,000
brought back old memories.

188
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
It's all my fault, this gold watch.

189
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
That was Old Master's

190
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,960
most treasured item, never left his side.

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,720
You know?

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Back then, Old Master was just like you now.

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
His business was booming.

194
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
But as it grew bigger,

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
the risks grew too.

196
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
Eventually, he hit trouble.

197
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
He had to turn to my Duan Ginseng House for help.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,560
He gave me this gold watch as thanks.

199
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,280
So tell me,

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
how about this—

201
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
today,

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,000
I return it to its rightful owner?

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,000
No need.

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,120
Since my father gave it to you,

205
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
I won't take it back.

206
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,960
Don't say that.

207
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,800
You should take it.

208
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,720
Your business is getting bigger now.

209
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,160
Big business means big risks.

210
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
If one day

211
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,840
you face trouble like your father did,

212
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,800
you'll need Duan Ginseng House again.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Then you can return the watch as thanks.

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
When Duan Jiuye steps in,

215
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
it's always fifty percent above market price.

216
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
You've helped me a lot.

217
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,400
Business is give and take.

218
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,120
What?

219
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,120
Holding a grudge?

220
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
It's a misunderstanding, Duan Jiuye.

221
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,560
Please, take the watch back.

222
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,120
If Duan Ginseng House

223
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,560
ever faces trouble,

224
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,080
I'll come for it then.

225
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,720
Why does it sound like you're cursing me?

226
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,280
No, Duan Jiuye, that's not it.

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
It's just a joke.

228
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
It's just business.

229
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
The bigger it gets,

230
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,280
the greater the risk.

231
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,840
I'll leave it here.

232
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
Here it is for you.

233
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
Come, come, this box.

234
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,960
Thank you.

235
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Alright, let's go.

236
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,960
Okay.

237
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,080
I'll come again another day.

238
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,600
I'll come again another day.

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,360
Boss, you—

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,080
You—

241
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Let's go to this one.

242
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's go.

243
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Boss, boss!

244
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Come on, let's go.

245
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
That's odd.

246
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,520
Just days ago, they were so polite.

247
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,080
Now they act like strangers.

248
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,360
It's all that old fox Duan Jiuye's doing.

249
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I don't buy it.

250
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,080
Songling Town is huge.

251
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,080
That old fox Duan—

252
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,960
can he really control every ginseng farmer and house?

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
We'll ask each one.

254
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,040
Let's go.

255
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,360
Let's go.

256
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,840
No, no, no.

257
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,400
Hurry, let's go.

258
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,160
Go.

259
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Sir, you have ginseng but won't sell to us?

260
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,200
Why not?

261
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
Enough, enough.

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,520
Just give up.

263
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Might as well rename Songling Town.

264
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,360
Call it Duan Town, since he owns it all.

265
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Let's keep looking.

266
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,960
Go.

267
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Sister Haitang.

268
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,920
Can we raise the price

269
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
of that batch by another ten percent?

270
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,600
No.

271
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
That batch was already bought at a high price.

272
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Let's work together next time.

273
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,200
But—

274
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
Didn't we already agree on the price?

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
It's all settled.

276
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,600
You may go.

277
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,160
Yes.

278
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,080
Duan Jiuye.

279
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,960
The ledger.

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Duan Jiuye.

281
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
Right now, we hold

282
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
half of Songling Town's ginseng.

283
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Jin Shisan won't be able to deliver this time.

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,080
Should we keep buying?

285
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,840
Keep buying.

286
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,520
But Jin Shisan has raised the price

287
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,920
to sixty percent above market.

288
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,840
At the current price,

289
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,920
to buy seventy percent of Songling Town's ginseng

290
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,600
will cost a fortune.

291
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
Don't worry about that.

292
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
I just want Liuhe Tang to know

293
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,600
if they want to do business here,

294
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
they must work with Duan Ginseng House.

295
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
As for Jin Shisan,

296
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,720
he'll have to risk everything

297
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,280
to compete with us.

298
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Good.

299
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
I'd be worried if he didn't fight.

300
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,480
If he does, he's fallen for the same trap as his father.

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,040
How I took down his father back then—

302
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,720
I'll do the same to him now.

303
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,280
Jin Shisan has no money.

304
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's see how he explains that to Liuhe Tang.

305
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
If it comes to that,

306
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Jin Shisan won't survive.

307
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,840
I'll be the Jin family's great benefactor.

308
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,960
As long as the boy isn't as stubborn as his father,

309
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,080
he'll hand over The Nine Immortals' Compass.

310
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
And the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

311
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,160
Maybe I'll even play the good guy,

312
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,520
give him silver to escape overseas.

313
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,160
But, Duan Jiuye,

314
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
aren't you afraid Jin Shisan

315
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,720
will find the Ginseng King and get rich himself?

316
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,360
You little fool,

317
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
think carefully.

318
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,160
If Jin Shisan knew about the Ginseng King,

319
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,160
when he gets the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

320
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,360
why wouldn't he dig it up himself?

321
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,640
Why bother playing business games with us?

322
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,920
That's true.

323
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,400
Jin Shisan

324
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,160
We've already raised the price.

325
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,960
Still, we barely bought any ginseng.

326
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,520
Raise the price by ten percent tomorrow.

327
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,920
Jinzi

328
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,160
Easy, don't move so much.

329
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,760
Jinzi

330
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
I said easy, you're still moving.

331
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Bro, we caught a thief.

332
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,200
Nonsense.

333
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm a chivalrous bandit, thank you.

334
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
Isn't that still a thief?

335
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
Don't look at this bandit's face.

336
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,640
Wait, who are you?

337
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,720
Why are you so loud?

338
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,840
May I ask your name, miss?

339
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
She seems to be a friend of Ruiyi.

340
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,720
Her name is Bai Tao.

341
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,960
Bai Tao.

342
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,080
Ruiyi.

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,600
I heard Jin Shisan

344
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
is having trouble gathering ginseng.

345
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,960
So I bought—

346
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,840
No, wait—

347
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,840
I stole some fine ginseng just for you.

348
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,960
To help you out in a pinch.

349
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Thank you, Miss Bai.

350
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,160
Don't worry.

351
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,720
Until Ruiyi returns,

352
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,080
I'll help you through this rough patch.

353
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,280
By the way—

354
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,160
Any love letters for her

355
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,280
you want me to deliver?

356
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Happy to help.

357
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Bai.

358
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,400
But this ginseng—

359
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
It's the lowest grade, just garden ginseng.

360
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,600
It won't fetch a good price.

361
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
No way!

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,400
I paid a fortune for it!

363
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
The seller swore it was top quality.

364
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,400
Darn it.

365
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Rats are gnawing on your ginseng.

366
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,040
What kind of friends did Dog Nose make?

367
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
What are you saying?

368
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,360
Maybe they meant well.

369
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,600
As for this ginseng—

370
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,360
Just slice it for tea.
