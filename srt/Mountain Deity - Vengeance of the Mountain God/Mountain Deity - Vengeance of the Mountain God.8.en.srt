1
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Brother

2
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,760
You're back.

3
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,040
Dinner's ready.

4
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Jin Shisan is back.

5
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,040
You've grown taller.

6
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,040
You rascal, always out and about—

7
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
What are you showing off for outside?

8
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
You never come home to practice your skills.

9
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,760
Enough, come eat now.

10
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Eat up, brother.

11
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,440
Come eat, child.

12
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm calling you—come eat!

13
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,160
Come here.

14
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,800
Are you spaced out?

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
Hurry, it's still hot.

16
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,120
What are you doing?

17
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm calling you—come eat!

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,200
Come here.

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,400
Come eat now.

20
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Come on, don't just stand there—eat!

21
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,200
This kid...

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,680
Come on, come here, brother.

23
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,400
Time to eat.

24
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm back.

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Jin family

26
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,760
Ancestors above,

27
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,040
Three years ago,

28
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
My father, Jin Buhuan,

29
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
led our kin to the mountain to honor the spirits.

30
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,680
He was betrayed by villains.

31
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Our whole clan was slaughtered.

32
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Only Jin Shisan survived.

33
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Jin Shisan has lived in hiding for years.

34
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I dared not seek death.

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,760
Only to return to the Ginseng Expedition today.

36
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,040
To uncover the truth.

37
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,200
For my father,

38
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
for my whole clan,

39
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,400
to avenge our blood.

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,840
Restore

41
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
Jin Ginseng House.

42
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,480
Ancestors, I beg you

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,960
for guidance and protection.

44
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,680
Miss Yang, you really like watching
people from the shadows.

45
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,080
But right now, you're the one
hiding in the dark.

46
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
I, Yang Ruyi, always speak and act
with honesty and integrity.

47
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
Honest people don't speak in riddles.

48
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,080
Fine.

49
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Then let's be direct and speak openly.

50
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,760
Miss Yang, what brings you here?

51
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
I just wanted to ask you something.

52
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,920
That day in the woods—

53
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
Why did you shield me from that arrow?

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Miss Yang, you misunderstood.

55
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,240
No.

56
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
I blocked it for you.

57
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,080
But I didn't want you to block it for me.

58
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,240
That arrow was meant for me.

59
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,520
So you're in a dangerous position now.

60
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
You hold the Divine Disk now.

61
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,960
All the ginseng clans

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
will be watching you like hawks.

63
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,800
So your Yang family

64
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,960
became the first to try and seize the Divine Disk.

65
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,960
My brother was just used as a pawn.

66
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,760
And what about you?

67
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
I want to form an alliance with you.

68
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,920
My brother uses force,

69
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
while I use words.

70
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
If we can't take it, we win you over.

71
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
No wonder you're called Yang Ruyi.

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,080
Your Yang family's schemes

73
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,560
have reached all the way to my Jin family shrine.

74
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,040
Fine.

75
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Since Boss Jin isn't interested,

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
just pretend I was never here.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,360
Goodbye.

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
I don't wish to be your enemy.

79
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
But we can't be friends either.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
I wonder what Brother Shisan

81
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
is talking about with Sister Ruyi inside.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,360
They've been talking for so long.

83
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
What are you mumbling about?

84
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Reciting scriptures.

85
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,800
Scriptures?

86
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,120
What scriptures are you reciting?

87
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,680
The Classic of Mountains and Seas.

88
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Cui—

89
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Haiyue.

90
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
Can you teach me some Ginseng Expedition rules?

91
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,040
In a few days,

92
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,680
I'll join Brother Jin on the Ginseng Expedition.

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
I don't want to hold him back.

94
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
You think you can just call her Haiyue?

95
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,520
Go on, get out of here.

96
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Go play somewhere else.

97
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
Look at my sister Haiyue—

98
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
she's adorable even when she's angry.

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,640
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

100
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,680
So young, yet already a Hunt Master.

101
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,200
That's top status in the Changbai ginseng clan.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
Way better than Yang Ruyi.

103
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Don't say that about Sister Ruyi.

104
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,120
She once dug up a Six-Petiole Wild Ginseng.

105
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
So what?

106
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,360
We'll just dig up an even higher-grade ginseng.

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,840
Haiyue.

108
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
You're so skilled—

109
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
teach me, will you?

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Alright.

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Let me explain it to you.

112
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
First of all,

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
when starting a Ginseng Expedition,

114
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,120
you must pick an auspicious day.

115
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
A team can be big or small,

116
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,360
but the Hunt Master decides who joins.

117
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,680
The Hunt Master

118
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,200
is the lead stick of the team.

119
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,760
Mainly responsible for scouting and finding ginseng.

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
The others

121
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
line up in a row behind.

122
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,040
The one behind the Hunt Master is the waist stick.

123
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,400
They help the lead stick cover any gaps.

124
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
After finding ginseng,

125
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,400
it's mainly their job

126
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,240
to dig it up with the lead stick's help.

127
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,960
Those beside the waist stick are the side sticks.

128
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,080
They search the edges for ginseng

129
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,360
and handle the team's safety.

130
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,120
They guard against sudden attacks by beasts or snakes.

131
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,480
I can do that job!

132
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,680
You?

133
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,040
Oh, right—

134
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,240
there's one more role.

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,080
The helper.

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,960
They handle all the logistics.

137
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm not doing that.

138
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,360
Haiyue, protect me!

139
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,360
Brother Shisan.

140
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,040
Tomorrow is the Ginseng Expedition Gathering.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,360
We still have a lot to prepare.

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Jin—

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
I found two shotguns in the backyard.

144
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800
Both were used by your father.

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
This one's a German twelve-shot.

146
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,240
And this one—

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,680
your father bought it from the Russians, a repeating rifle.

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
This Ginseng Expedition is risky.

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,240
Let's bring them all.

150
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,360
Brother Luo—

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
Ginseng hunters can't say unlucky things.

152
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,360
We must say we'll turn misfortune to fortune.

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Great luck and prosperity.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Darn, my big mouth.

155
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,240
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

157
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,560
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

158
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
Great luck and prosperity.

159
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Great luck and prosperity.

160
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
That old Duan Jiu—

161
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
I feel sick just seeing him now.

162
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,360
I've had enough of days like this.

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,040
I followed him when I was still a young woman.

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,560
And in the end—

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
the old man never gave me anything real.

166
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,360
He owns dozens of ginseng houses,

167
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
but won't let me touch any business.

168
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,680
Why are you getting angry as you talk?

169
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,240
You...

170
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
Just wait a little longer.

171
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
Once I take over the Yang family,

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,560
you won't have to serve Duan Jiu anymore.

173
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
But I really can't wait any longer.

174
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,560
At this Ginseng Expedition Gathering,

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
if we dig up the Ginseng King,

176
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,120
we'll leave and start a new life.

177
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Ginseng King...

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,360
That's easier said than done.

179
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
We can't count on the Jin family.

180
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,120
Only if Yang and Duan join forces

181
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll go persuade Old Duan Jiu.

182
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,120
This time,

183
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
we can only rely on your sister, Yang Ruyi,

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
to compete with Jin Shisan.

185
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Alright.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We'll do as you say.

187
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,880
Okay?

188
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,360
Jin Shisan

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Is this The Nine Immortals' Compass?

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Can I take a look at it?

191
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,240
You're Cui Haiyue's younger sister, right?

192
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
My name is Cui Enxi.

193
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,240
Just call me Enxi from now on.

194
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,360
Miss Enxi, is there something you need?

195
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,120
Jin Shisan

196
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
You're really in the spotlight now.

197
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,560
Your future looks bright.

198
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,680
And you manage such a big family business.

199
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,800
You must need a capable assistant.

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
By your side, right?

201
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,120
Is this Cui Haiyue's idea?

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,440
Of course not.

203
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,040
My sister is honest but naive.

204
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
She wouldn't think of this.

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Besides,

206
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,800
my sister's personality

207
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
is easy to be manipulated.

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
She gets pushed around.

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,360
Father made her Hunt Master

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,120
just because she's the eldest.

211
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
And I'm the youngest.

212
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
But if you talk about skill and brains,

213
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm better than her.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,240
You and Cui Haiyue are nothing alike.

215
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,240
Jin Shisan

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm just a blunt person.

217
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,680
Don't take it personally.

218
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
I think the people around you,

219
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
like Chief Luo,

220
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,040
and that Yan... Bao guy,

221
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
aren't cut out for business.

222
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
One's a bandit.

223
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,560
The other acts like a fool.

224
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,920
My sister told me

225
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
you rescued him from some blood slave den.

226
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
You saved him.

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,560
No parents, no family.

228
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Well,

229
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
Chief Luo and Bao

230
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,000
are my brothers through thick and thin.

231
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Cui Haiyue saved my life.

232
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,120
Miss Enxi,

233
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,000
look,

234
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
our Jin Ginseng House isn't big.

235
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Just this small courtyard.

236
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
Three or four people.

237
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
It's already crowded.

238
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
And lively enough.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
If you have nothing else,

240
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,480
please head back.

241
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,680
Darn it, kindness wasted.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
We'll see.

243
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,560
Enxi.

244
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,360
Sis.

245
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
When did you get here?

246
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,120
I already greeted Jin Shisan.

247
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,560
More than just a greeting.

248
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
They're all useless.

249
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,680
Not one is worth mentioning.

250
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
Useless? What do you mean?

251
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,360
Who are you talking about? Me?

252
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
I don't really get what you mean.

253
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,480
Sis, can't you see?

254
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,920
That Divine Serpent Gallbladder

255
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,480
was wasted for nothing.

256
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,680
That Jin guy just wants to take advantage of us.

257
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,560
He doesn't plan to give us anything.

258
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,680
Enxi.

259
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
I never thought about

260
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,800
benefits or losses.

261
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,920
That gallbladder

262
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,320
was found by Jin Shisan's father

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,120
and our father during a Ginseng Expedition.

264
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
Our father survived the Divine Serpent

265
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
thanks to Old Jin, the Hunt Master.

266
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,800
The Jin family helped our father.

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
They helped our Cui family.

268
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
Cui Haiyue,

269
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm your real sister.

270
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
You won't speak up for me,

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
but you help outsiders.

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,360
Enxi.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,680
Do you remember what our father said

274
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,120
right before he died?

275
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,560
Always put morality

276
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,920
before personal gain.

277
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Morality, morality...

278
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
You all talk about morality.

279
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,800
But in the end,

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,680
father was still hounded to death by creditors.

281
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Fine, Cui Haiyue.

282
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
Hold on to your morality

283
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
and stay with these useless people.

284
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,240
Enxi.

285
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,120
Move aside.

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,360
Haiyue, your cooking is amazing.

287
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
You could open a restaurant.

288
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
Even eating can't shut you up.

289
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Jinzi.

290
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
Everything's almost packed.

291
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
You're the Hunt Master.

292
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
Assign everyone their tasks.

293
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Alright.

294
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll take the lead stick.

295
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
For the middle stick,

296
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,680
Haiyue,

297
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,480
you take it.

298
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
You have more experience.

299
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,800
Uncle Luo,

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,560
you and Bao take the side sticks.

301
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
One left, one right.

302
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,120
Jin Shisan

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,800
Have you decided where we'll start tomorrow?

304
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,600
Gale Pass.
