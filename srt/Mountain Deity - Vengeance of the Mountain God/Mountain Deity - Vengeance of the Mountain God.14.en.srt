1
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,680
Kill! Kill! Kill!

2
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,600
You can mess around if you want,

3
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
but don't drag the Yang family in.

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,760
I know what I'm doing.

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,440
Stay out of my business.

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,000
Kill! Kill! Kill!

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,880
What are you laughing at?

8
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,480
Kill! Kill! Kill!

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Me.

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Why am I laughing?

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm laughing at you.

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,720
You... you...

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,880
You... you...

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,240
All of you,

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,880
always reciting the Guild's rules,

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
but in your hearts,

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,920
you're all scheming.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,120
You honor the Mountain God out loud,

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
but inside,

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,920
you're thinking of crooked ways.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,280
Isn't that right?

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,560
My father always told me,

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
the heroes of the Ginseng Guild

24
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
were all Mountain Ginseng Gatherers.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
They weren't well-educated,

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,600
but their hearts were pure.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,920
But now,

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,080
you've turned the Guild

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,840
into a band of thieves.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,960
Arrogant.

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Just speaking the truth.

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
Such a defiant youngster—

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,200
how should he be punished?

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Cudgel Execution! Cudgel Execution!

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,560
Haiyue.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,720
How is it?

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,640
There's no other way out.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
We have to break him out.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,920
Let me confirm one last time.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,040
You grab that pile of hay,

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
go to the back door and set the woodshed on fire.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll go in while the smoke is thick,

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,600
and rescue Brother Jin.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,720
Let's split up, then.

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,480
Meet at Uncle Jin's grave before dark.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Haiyue.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,600
If something goes wrong,

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
and I get caught by those bastards,

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,240
run away fast.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,920
Stay alive.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Don't jinx it.

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Cui Haiyue.

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,000
I lo... lo... love...

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
Love... I... I love... I love...

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Don't forget me.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,200
Protect me.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
Cudgel Execution! Kneel!

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,920
Cudgel Execution!

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,400
Kneel!

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
Cudgel Execution! Cudgel Execution!

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
Mountain Ginseng Gatherers kneel to the Mountain God,

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
kneel to the ancestors and parents,

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,920
but never kneel to scoundrels.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
I told you not to kneel!

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,640
I don't care if you stand or kneel.

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Hurry up and do it!

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,040
I'll do it myself.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Who?

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Who are you?

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,200
Haitang.

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,360
This is more exciting than your stage play.

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
Isn't it?

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Thanks to Boss He for showing me the world.

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Boss Jin.

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,640
What kind of show is this?

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Boss He, please don't laugh.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,920
It's just a little misunderstanding.

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
That's good.

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,120
Touching Boss Jin means touching Liuhe Tang.

80
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,280
No one wants to tear off this mask.

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Boss He.

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,760
You came without even giving notice.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,200
When did Jin Shisan call for Liuhe Tang?

84
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,640
No idea.

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,960
Please, take a seat.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Boss Jin.

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,240
Boss Jin.

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,680
Why is no one saving you a seat?

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
He's saved!

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,360
He's saved!

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
Brother Jin is saved!

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,080
Jiu Ye.

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,520
Harmony brings wealth.

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,640
If our Boss Jin did anything wrong,

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,520
and offended your Guild brothers,

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,240
I, on behalf of Liuhe Tang, apologize to the Guild.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
Boss He, that's too much.

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
You're shortening my life with this.

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Brother Shisan.

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
Your uncle is getting old.

101
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Sometimes he sticks to old ways.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
His mind isn't as sharp.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,960
How could I have a misunderstanding with Liuhe Tang?

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
Help me explain.

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Jiu Ye.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
About Boss Lin—

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,480
I really can't find any evidence.

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,360
Maybe you should just keep punishing me.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
No, no, no.

110
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,360
Wait.

111
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
The Boss Lin you're talking about—

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
is it Boss Lin from Songling Town's Lin Ginseng Shop?

113
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Alright.

114
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,400
Jiu Ye.

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Let me air my grievances, too.

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,760
Please judge for me.

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,040
Not long ago,

118
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,760
the Master asked specifically for the Seven Fairies.

119
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
He sent me to buy them.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Boss Lin said he had them,

121
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
and sold them to me at a high price.

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
I was careless,

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
and didn't see it was fake ginseng.

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,120
The Master has such sharp eyes,

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
he spotted the fake instantly.

126
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,800
He was truly furious.

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,240
I nearly lost my head,

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
and your whole Songling Town almost vanished.

129
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Luckily, Boss Jin saved everyone.

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,800
He offered his family's Seven Fairies.

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,120
Only then did the Master calm down.

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
That freed me up,

133
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,360
so Boss Lin's whole family learned

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,960
there's no medicine for regret in this world.

135
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,800
What... what's going on?

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,800
It's about time.

137
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,640
Listen up, all of you!

138
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,960
Whoever gets the Nine Immortals' Compass first—

139
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
Jiu Ye will guarantee him a lifetime of riches.

140
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Yes!

141
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,200
Go!

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,280
Wait!

143
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
Manager Cui.

144
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,400
Jiu Ye has new orders.

145
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,240
Speak.

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,520
Jiu Ye says to withdraw.

147
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Withdraw!

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Has Boss Jin's misunderstanding with everyone
been resolved?

149
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,960
There was never any misunderstanding.

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,040
Brother Shisan,

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,080
all of us in the Ginseng Guild

152
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,760
pay our respects to Boss Jin.

153
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Jiu Ye,

154
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,680
everyone,

155
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
please rise, please rise, please rise.

156
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,200
Let this matter be put to rest.

157
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Boss Jin is generous and magnanimous.

158
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Yes, yes.

159
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,960
Thank you, Boss Jin. Thank you, Boss Jin.

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Alright.

161
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
The misunderstanding is cleared up.

162
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
Now, let me get to business.

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,800
Our Liuhe Tang will open ten ginseng shops
in Fengtian.

164
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,520
Ten shops, ten in total.

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,920
These ten ginseng shops

166
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,080
will all be managed by Boss Jin.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,760
He'll handle all ten shops.

168
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
Can he manage them all?

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,040
That's none of your concern.

170
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,920
Boss He, rest assured.

171
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
Fengtian is a place full of all sorts.

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,800
Good ginseng is priceless and rare.

173
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,800
But our Songling Town ginseng

174
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,360
is abundant and of high quality.

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
And our Mountain Ginseng Gatherer skills

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
are passed down from our ancestors.

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
They're renowned throughout the Northeast.

178
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,920
Isn't that right?

179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Yes, that's right, yes.

180
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,320
Good.

181
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes, that's true.

182
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,920
Let's do business together.

183
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Let's prosper together.

184
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,040
As for how you work with the other
Ginseng Guild bosses,

185
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
how you cooperate,

186
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I won't interfere.

187
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
It's all up to you.

188
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,720
Jiu Ye,

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
the one lying on the ground

190
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,320
has the deepest misunderstanding
with Liuhe Tang.

191
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
I'd like to invite him to the capital
for a drink.

192
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
To clear up the misunderstanding.

193
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,720
Is that alright?

194
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
Boss He has spoken.

195
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Do as you please.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,480
Then I'll take him with me.

197
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,800
Jiu Ye,

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Save me, Jiu Ye!

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm your favorite, you know!

200
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Jiu Ye, save me!

201
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,720
Everyone,

202
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,480
let's thank Boss Jin.

203
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you, Boss Jin. Much appreciated.

204
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,120
You're all too kind.

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
Thank you, Boss Jin. Much appreciated.

206
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Thank you, Boss Jin.

207
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,120
You're all too polite, too polite.

208
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,680
Thank you so much. We'll rely on Boss Jin.

209
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,240
Thank you, thank you.

210
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,880
Boss Jin, thanks. We'll count on you
from now on.

211
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
We'll rely on Boss Jin. Thank you.

212
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,560
Boss He,

213
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,720
Boss He,

214
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,920
Are you satisfied?

215
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,680
Phoenix's Single Tear.

216
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That's a fine name.

217
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,480
The Elder Master of the Hall

218
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
is like a phoenix descending from the heavens.

219
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,320
When the elder heard this name,

220
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
she believed it was a heavenly blessing.

221
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,320
She sent me here in a hurry.

222
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,040
Boss Jin loves to keep people guessing.

223
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
He only said it was an important guest.

224
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
When I met Boss He,

225
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
I realized it was Liuhe Tang's business.

226
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Here.

227
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
You're giving too much.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,120
If the Elder Master is happy,

229
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,480
we errand runners get some luck too.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Boss Jin,

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,360
I've left another batch at your place.

232
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Remember to check the goods.

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Alright.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Boss He, take care.

235
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,720
Jin Shisan,

236
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,600
you've worried me to death these days.

237
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,240
Do you know that?

238
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
You say nothing at all.

239
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
You just watch us all get anxious.

240
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Does that make you happy?

241
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,320
No.

242
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
I had already arranged with Boss He

243
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,440
to buy your ginseng.

244
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,480
And to do you a favor.

245
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
But I didn't expect

246
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
you'd act against me so quickly.

247
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,560
And ran right into Liuhe Tang's jaws.

248
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
You helped me sell the ginseng
at a sky-high price.

249
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,120
At least let me treat you to a meal.

250
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,000
Another day.

251
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
Boss He left some goods.

252
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,480
I need to go check them.

253
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,320
I'll head out first.

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,880
Boss He,

255
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,800
Boss He, please wait.

256
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,720
May I have a word with you?

257
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,040
Boss He,

258
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,240
There's a rumor in the Ginseng Guild

259
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,000
that Liuhe Tang and the foreigners
plan to open a factory in Fengtian.

260
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,360
It's true.

261
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
But the foreigners' terms

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,600
didn't satisfy the Elder Master.

263
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
It's already fallen through.

264
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,120
Boss He,

265
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
I have a request.

266
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,720
Could you hold off on releasing
this news

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,680
until three days from now?

268
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,800
I just need three days.

269
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Once it's done,

270
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,040
I'll give you all of Duan Jiu's assets.

271
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
All will be yours, Boss He.

272
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Looks like Boss Jin is confident.

273
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,800
Alright.

274
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll play along with you.

275
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
Thank you, Boss He.

276
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,800
Baobao,

277
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
go keep watch outside.

278
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,360
Don't worry, brother.

279
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,920
Spare me, Master!

280
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,680
Spare me, Master!

281
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
It's all that old Duan's fault.

282
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
He made me do it.

283
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Tell me something I don't know.

284
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,360
Maybe I'll let you live.

285
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
Duan wants to take from you

286
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,000
the Dragon's Twin Incense and
the Nine Immortals' Compass.

287
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,360
That's right.

288
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
When Duan was drunk once,

289
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
he let slip

290
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,680
that the Jin family's massacre
at the Mountain God Temple

291
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,920
was all Duan's scheme.

292
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Dad

293
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
You're in such good spirits today.

294
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,680
Ruyi,

295
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,680
This is the banknote from selling
Phoenix's Single Tear.

296
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,560
Please take a look.

297
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,360
From now on,

298
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
any business transactions on the books

299
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,800
handled by you don't need to be reported to me.

300
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,240
Just hand them straight to the accountant.

301
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160
I understand.

302
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,720
It's just that this deal is so big,

303
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,360
I felt I should at least let you know.

304
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560
To me, this deal

305
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
isn't about the money.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,120
It's Jin Shisan himself

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
who's truly valuable.

308
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,480
Ruyi,

309
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,880
you're the one who really gained from this deal.

310
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,800
Dad, I...

311
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
I've been through all this before.

312
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,600
You think I don't know what's on your mind?

313
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Ruyi,

314
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,320
invite Jin Shisan over to our home.

315
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
I'll help you check him out.

316
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Okay.

317
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,480
Alright, alright, alright.

318
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,040
Thank you, thank you. Congratulations!

319
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,720
Please come in, come inside.

320
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,360
Congratulations, thank you.

321
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,120
Come in, come in. Congratulations, thank you.

322
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,440
Congratulations, congratulations! Please come in.

323
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,680
Come in, come in, come in. Thank you.

324
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,560
Congratulations, Boss Jin. Best wishes.

325
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
Thank you. Congratulations! Please come in.

326
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Come in. Congratulations.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
Jiu Ye, please calm down.

328
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,040
Take a look.

329
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,480
What do you think of this one?

330
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,160
Come here, miss.

331
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,720
Take a look.

332
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,160
Looks nice.

333
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,800
Buy it.

334
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,440
Let's go with this one.

335
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,920
It's like the popular style in the capital.

336
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,920
Looks good.

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,560
Buy it.

338
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
You're thinking about Jin Shisan, aren't you?

339
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,880
It's pretty.

340
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,440
Buy it.

341
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
You're definitely distracted.

342
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,240
Come on, tell me.

343
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,320
I'll help you figure it out.

344
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
My dad wants to meet him.

345
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,800
Meeting the parents?

346
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
That's moving fast.

347
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Keep your voice down.

348
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,800
How far have you two gotten?

349
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,680
Holding hands.

350
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,040
Kissing.

351
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,120
Or have you gone all the way?

352
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Miss,

353
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I don't care about my reputation.

354
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,120
Sorry, sorry.

355
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,800
Let's get back to business.

356
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,920
Go ahead.

357
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,240
Jin Shisan is so closed-off.

358
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,000
He never says flattering things.

359
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,240
What if he upsets my dad?

360
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,880
If he doesn't approve,

361
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
then just elope.

362
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't worry.

363
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll cover for you two when you run away.

364
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I'll handle everything.

365
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,360
I knew I couldn't count on you.
