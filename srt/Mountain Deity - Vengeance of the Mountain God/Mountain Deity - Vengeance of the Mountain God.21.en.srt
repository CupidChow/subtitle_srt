1
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,440
It's all men over there.

2
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Can I sleep with you guys?

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Sure, Enxi.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
Then sleep here with me.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Go stay over there.

6
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,320
Don't act like everyone owes you.

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
This is Haiyue's spot.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,080
Sister Ruyi.

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,320
Didn't you hear what I said?

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,240
I told you to go over there.

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,040
If you don't want to stay there,

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,040
then get out.

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
Who spoiled you with these bad habits?

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,520
Speaking of Nanpo,

15
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,400
No one knows it better than Yang Baye.

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
Ever since five years ago,

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,560
he came to Nanpo for wild ginseng.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,560
I've never been to Nanpo.

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm not familiar with it.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,880
Brother.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,040
Kid.

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,920
Why are you here?

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,320
Where are your parents?

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,520
Aren't they right here?

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Don't talk to him.

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
Come on, let's go.

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,600
Go, go, go.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,560
Go, go, hurry up.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
Hurry, let's go. We're leaving.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
It's going to be lively today.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
It's a good day.

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,640
Slow down.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,480
Careful, careful.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,480
Wait a moment.

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Excuse me,

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
where are you all headed?

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
This is Bangchui Tun.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
We're going to honor the Venerable Grandfather and Grandmother.

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,200
Who are you?

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,400
Venerable Grandfather, Venerable Grandmother.

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Try this.

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,560
Here, let me fill it up for you.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Drink some more.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,760
Thank you, thank you.

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,200
Here.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,400
This tastes good.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Eat this, eat this.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,640
This is delicious.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,280
Ancient Grandfather and Grandmother are here.

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,200
They've arrived.

52
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,120
They're here, they're here!

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,280
Everyone, have a drink.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Alright, alright.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,480
Make way.

56
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,640
What are you doing?

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
What are you all doing?

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,840
Ancient Grandfather and Grandmother.

59
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,760
Grandmother, here, here.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,040
Why are you pushing?

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,040
Move aside.

62
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,040
Thank you, Grandmother.

63
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,400
Such a nice face.

64
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
Stay here.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,640
Grandmother will find you a wife and give you children.

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
That's right, stay here.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Stay here.

68
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,800
Stay here, stay here, stay here.

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Young man, stay here.

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Stay here, stay here, stay here.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,680
Stay, stay.

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Stay here, stay here, stay here.

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
Stay, stay.

74
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
Stay here.

75
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Stay, stay, stay.

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,080
Stay here.

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,040
Jerk.

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,240
Luo Shu.

79
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,480
Jinzi.

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,280
Something's up.

81
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,680
Let's go!

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Go!

83
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,240
Chase them!

84
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,920
Retreat!

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,960
Come.

86
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,520
These aren't Duan Jiuye's men.

87
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Who wants us dead?

88
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,080
It's empty.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,960
How is that possible?

90
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,560
I've been guarding it well.

91
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,280
It's gone.

92
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,080
Was it when Enxi bumped into you?

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
We should've noticed earlier.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,680
I'll go find her now.

95
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,840
Get back the Sacred Ginseng and Compass.

96
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,480
She chose to steal them.

97
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
She definitely won't return them.

98
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,680
I think this Enxi

99
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
never saw you as family.

100
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,800
It's my fault.

101
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,360
I didn't protect it well.

102
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,960
It's not your fault.

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,280
Everyone, don't worry.

104
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,360
I'll figure something out.

105
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,960
Jiuye.

106
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,040
It's in hand.

107
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Enxi won't let you down, Jiuye.

108
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
The Nine Immortals' Compass.

109
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

110
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Enxi.

111
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,520
You did a great job this time.

112
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
I'll reward you.

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,200
Enxi is willing to serve Jiuye.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Next is the location of the treasure cave.

115
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,520
This Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is king of all ginseng.

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,840
The place where the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is

117
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Could it be

118
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
the blessed land?

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,480
Let's go.

120
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,520
Jinzi.

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,800
Should we go find Duan Jiuye

122
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,680
and take back the ginseng and compass?

123
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,960
No.

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,640
They have more people.

125
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,800
And more weapons.

126
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,080
We're at a disadvantage.

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,760
Then what do we do?

128
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,840
That damn Enxi.

129
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
She followed us halfway last time.

130
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,480
She surely remembers the way back.

131
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
Now we have the Sacred Ginseng
and the Compass.

132
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
Doesn't that mean...

133
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,520
That's right.

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,640
If this treasure cave is truly linked
to your foster father...

135
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,680
Are we really going to let Duan Jiuye...

136
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,800
It's fine.

137
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,800
The southern woods

138
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
are denser than the west and north.

139
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Even if we mark the path,

140
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
it's still hard to find a way out.

141
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Spirit Wall incidents happen often.

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,040
We can try to look around.

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,320
Yes.

144
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,360
You're right.

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
This forest is so vast.

146
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,040
Finding the treasure cave isn't easy.

147
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,800
But finding a group of people is much easier.

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
As long as they're still in these woods,

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
there will be traces.

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,240
Let's make things simpler.

151
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,800
Find the people first.

152
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,240
Jinzi.

153
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
This branch was cut with a knife.

154
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,320
Look.

155
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,560
Someone must've been here, right?

156
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,720
Luo Shu.

157
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
Aren't these Duan Jiuye's men?

158
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Who would be so ruthless?

159
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,480
Both were killed with a single strike.

160
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
Knowing Duan Jiuye's character,

161
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,040
these two being left here

162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
must mean they found the treasure cave.

163
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,240
Thirteen.

164
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,560
Look.

165
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,920
Jinzi.

166
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
There are friends here.

167
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,360
These guys' personalities...

168
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,480
No,

169
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,880
they're all pretty quiet.

170
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,040
They don't chat much, do they?

171
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,480
How do you know they're guys?

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
Maybe they're girls.

173
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,360
Impossible.

174
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
We've said so much already,

175
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
and not a single reply.

176
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,440
Only men act like that.

177
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,800
Why does this look like a coffin?

178
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,480
Brother Luo.

179
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
Don't scare us.

180
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
White means evil energy.

181
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,360
There's heavy gloom here.

182
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,880
I get it now.

183
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,000
There are eight of them.

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,480
They represent the eight directions
of the Bagua.

185
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,240
And the five of us

186
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
match the five elements.

187
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
Metal, wood, water, fire, earth.

188
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,120
Qian and Dui are metal.

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,040
Zhen and Xun are wood.

190
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Kun and Gen are earth.

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,000
Li is fire.

192
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,920
Kan is water.

193
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Old rules.

194
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Take the Qian position.

195
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,720
Brother.

196
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,120
So it's them.

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,720
It's all miasma.

198
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,800
Put it down.

199
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,360
Let's go.

200
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,800
Is this some earthly paradise?

201
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
The ground is covered with big bangchui.

202
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,040
Are you okay?

203
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,040
Luo Shu.

204
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,160
Brother Luo.

205
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,440
Brother Luo.

206
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
Brother Luo, Chief Luo, Brother Luo.

207
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
Brother Luo, Luo Shu.

208
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,680
How are you feeling?

209
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm fine.

210
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,800
Luo Shu.

211
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,160
Luo Shu.

212
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,480
Luo Shu.

213
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,360
From the Jin family.

214
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,480
I... I've returned it.

215
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,240
Jinzi, I can't protect you anymore.

216
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Brother Luo.

217
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Brother Luo, Luo Shu.

218
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,720
Brother Luo, Brother Luo.

219
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,680
Brother Jinzi.

220
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,480
He's not dead.

221
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,680
Brother Luo won't die.

222
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Where's your medicine?

223
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Get your medicine out.

224
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
Save him!

225
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,680
Brother Luo.

226
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,800
Kid.

227
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,040
Let me tell you.

228
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,120
A man's knees are worth gold.

229
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Kneel to heaven, earth, and parents.

230
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,800
Never kneel to anything else.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,040
Get up.

232
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Brother Luo.

233
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
You're missing that girl, aren't you?

234
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm not missing her.

235
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
Why would I miss her?

236
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm just worried she'll distract Jinzi.

237
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Why miss her?

238
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,360
I do miss her.

239
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
You...

240
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,880
Our Haiyue is really something.

241
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,560
Oh, right.

242
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
I brought you some snacks from the capital.

243
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,480
Put them away quickly.

244
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Don't let that kid eat them all.

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
Chief Luo.

246
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,560
He's a hero.

247
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,920
He truly is a hero.

248
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,720
But Luo Shu,

249
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,320
why did you have to be a hero?

250
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,720
You should be at the mortuary
with your brothers,

251
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,800
drinking and feasting,

252
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,080
living freely for the rest of your life.

253
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,600
You should marry a good wife,

254
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
have a son,

255
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,600
and enjoy your grandchildren.

256
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,560
I shouldn't have brought you into the mountains.

257
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
Making you live in constant fear,

258
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
enduring hardship and sleeping outdoors.

259
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,200
I put you through this.

260
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Don't think that way.

261
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,440
Thirteen.

262
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,320
We've all received Old Chief Jin's kindness.

263
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
You saved Baobao from a pile of corpses.

264
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,840
We're all willing

265
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
to go through this with you.

266
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,200
That's right.

267
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,440
Brother Jinzi.

268
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
We're all doing this willingly.

269
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Old Chief Jin's and Chief Luo's vengeance—

270
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,640
we all must avenge them.
