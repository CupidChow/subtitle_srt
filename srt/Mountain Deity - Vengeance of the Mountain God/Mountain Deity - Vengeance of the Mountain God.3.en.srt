1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,400
Want it

2
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,320
This fills you up, but it's not good

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,720
You don't know shit

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,400
This is good stuff, we all eat it

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
This ginseng is thick at the top, thin at the bottom

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
Look at its lines and grooves

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,200
And its ginseng roots

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,160
This is cultivated ginseng

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
It's worthless

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
You can tell ginseng apart

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Where are you from

12
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Me

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
I... I used to help my parents

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Worked odd jobs at a ginseng shop

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
So I know a bit

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,560
But this is just cultivated ginseng

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,520
It can't nourish blood

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,160
What's the point of knowing that

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,280
Knowing this

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
Can save your life

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Save your life

22
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
Boss, you're here

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
Boss, the batch you wanted

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,920
I've raised them all for you

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,640
I followed your orders strictly

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,120
Fed these blood slaves plenty of premium ginseng

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,200
Take a look

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
There's a very special one here

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
It's top quality

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,240
About the final payment

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,960
Can you pay a bit more, right

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Boss, may I speak with you privately

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,920
May I speak with you privately

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,920
Come

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,920
Please tell the financier for me

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Let him rest assured

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
His ritual

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Will go smoothly, no problems

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,560
Yes, yes, yes

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,760
Pull it out and take a look

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
This specimen is really good

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
Let's stick to the old rules

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
Pay first, check the goods after, okay

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,720
Uh, uh

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
You don't know the rules

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Don't know the rules

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
Since you don't know the rules

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Then you can't leave

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,280
Leave the money

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,920
Or leave your life

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,560
Three

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,480
Two

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,080
One

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,200
Shoot

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Don't let him get away

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
Hurry, go

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,840
Go, go, stop looking, hurry

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
Don't run, don't run

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
Stop! Where are you running

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,080
Still trying to run

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,280
Go

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,040
Push hard

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,040
Come on

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
We're not out of danger yet

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,840
We need to hurry

66
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
Brother, sorry about this

67
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
Actually, when I first saw you

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,320
I knew you were that Jin Shisan kid

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,360
Do you know me

70
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,280
Qiao San'er, I'll kill you

71
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
Kid, you're tough to kill

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,040
The debt I mentioned

73
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
Was about the Lin family's eldest son

74
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Since I saved you

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
You should do a good deed to the end

76
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Repay my debt with your life

77
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Take the money and go

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,480
Thank you, Third Master

79
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
You're holding it pretty tight

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Who dares take anyone's money

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
It's your turn

82
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,160
I heard your eyes

83
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,040
One's black, one's green

84
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,160
If I dig out the green one

85
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Will it still be green

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,360
Wait

87
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
Aren't you after money

88
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,440
Instead of taking my eyes

89
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Why not use my eyes

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
To show you a way to fortune

91
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,880
Dozens of boxes of premium ginseng

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
You know their value

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
No need to explain

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
Even if you follow Lin Wancheng all your life

95
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,040
You'd never touch them

96
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
Just don't know

97
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,600
If you have the guts to take them

98
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,280
Give me some

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,440
Eat, eat

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Come

101
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,160
Go

102
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,040
Is it here

103
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,280
Go

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,160
We're here

105
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,440
See it

106
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,840
It's on that table

107
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Take as much as you can carry

108
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,720
At this time

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,760
The traffickers should be

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,600
Drinking at the tavern to the east

111
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,480
You can act now

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,320
Qiao San'er

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
The warehouse is guarded on all sides

114
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,960
Only one exit at the back

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,240
Leads straight to Changbai Shan's southwest

116
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,000
If I die

117
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,640
Who'll get you out

118
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,000
So you planned it all

119
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,520
Go

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,000
You guys, open it and check

121
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,880
Come here, come here

122
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,560
Okay

123
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,000
Go, that way

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,440
You guys, grab those over there

125
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,320
Thief! Thief!

126
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,440
Thief! Thief!

127
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,200
What's going on, thief!

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,120
Don't kill me

129
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Thank you

130
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,000
No need to thank me

131
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
I should thank you

132
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,640
How did you know

133
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,760
Bro

134
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
This warehouse has so many windows

135
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,120
You spoke near mine on purpose

136
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
So I'd hear you, right

137
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,880
Your trick lured them in and used others to kill

138
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,760
Brilliant

139
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
Without your midnight warning

140
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
This wouldn't have worked

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,000
Same to you

142
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,200
I have to save someone

143
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Hurry, go, go

144
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Can't let them escape

145
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,320
Chase them

146
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,800
Chase

147
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,560
Follow

148
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,640
Don't let him run, catch him, go

149
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,680
Go, go, go

150
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,800
Bro,

151
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
I can't run anymore.

152
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
Unless the King of Hell takes me away,

153
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
no one can make me take another step.

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,320
Where do we go next?

155
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Follow this road and we'll reach Black Dragon River.

156
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Then we'll get out of the mountains.

157
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
Let's go.

158
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,680
Bro,

159
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,560
Leave me, just go.

160
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,680
What are you saying?

161
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,880
If it weren't for you,

162
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,440
I'd have been drained dry as a blood slave.

163
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
From now on, my life is yours.

164
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,200
Go.

165
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,960
Jin Shisan.

166
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,440
Interesting.

167
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,160
You're exactly who I'm looking for.
