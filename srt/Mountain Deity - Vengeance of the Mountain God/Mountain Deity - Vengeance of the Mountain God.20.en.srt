1
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,840
Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang,
please get up.

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,520
You're so devoted.

3
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,680
You're a true saint.

4
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
But I'm begging you.

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,960
Please get up first.

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
Let's go back to the Yang family
and settle the accounts, okay?

7
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,640
Young Master Yang.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,480
Young Master Yang, don't lie down.

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Is this enough?

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,640
Miss Ruyi.

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,320
That's enough, that's enough.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,560
You may go.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Alright.

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Thank you, Miss Ruyi.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,200
Brother.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,320
Waiter.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
So drunk like this...

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,200
Get up, I'll take you home.

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Yang Tingxuan.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,080
Wake up.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
Wake up.

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Ruyi...

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,200
Do you know who I am now?

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,200
Ruyi.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Come on, I'll take you home.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,240
Don't embarrass yourself here.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,480
I'm the one embarrassing myself?

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,520
Jiu'er and I truly love each other.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,360
What about you?

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't throw yourself at him.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Girl.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't throw yourself at him.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Brother Jinzi, Brother Luo.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
Put the guns down.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,080
It's fine.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Better to resolve grudges than make them.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
We're not here to fight today.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,400
I've forgotten everything before.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Boss Duan.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,440
You came with guns

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
to settle things with us?

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,400
Jin Shisan.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
Nothing gets past you.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Boss He.

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Eunhee.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
Sit down.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,120
Shisan.

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Let's not mention what happened in the woods.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,280
It's all in the past.

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
Which thing in the woods aren't we mentioning?

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
It's not you, kid...

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,040
Jiuye.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Let me talk to Boss Jin alone.

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Let's go.

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,680
Jiuye.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Brother Shisan.

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,040
No need to say why I'm here this time.

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Please be direct, Boss He.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
Brother Shisan.

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
It's just us now.

61
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
No need to put on airs.

62
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
Here's a hint.

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
Nine Immortals Compass.

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,680
Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Brother Shisan.

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,200
Since we started working together,

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,560
you've made a lot of money for Liuhe Tang.

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,560
Lin Family Ginseng Shop.

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
And this time,

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,320
you helped me acquire all of Duan Jiu's shops.

71
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Now Liuhe Tang's ginseng business in Songling Town

72
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,600
controls half the market.

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
You even got me the Phoenix's Single Tear.

74
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,480
All these businesses,

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,280
you took nothing for yourself.

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,280
I know it well in my heart.

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,720
I treat you like family.

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
But you sure keep secrets tight.

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,840
The Celestial Grotto.

80
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,440
This treasure trove, rich as a nation.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
You haven't let slip a single word.

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,120
So you're saying...

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,000
Boss He, you took Duan Jiu away?

84
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Brother Shisan.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
What kind of person do you think I am?

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
Duan Jiu has targeted you many times.

87
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
Every time, I stepped in for you.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,680
How could I ever harm you?

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,000
But then again,

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
Though Duan Jiu is greedy,

91
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,440
and ruthless in business,

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,320
you've already ruined him.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Why push him to the brink?

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
In business,

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,880
he can't recover now.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,560
Boss He.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
You know

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm not greedy for money or profit.

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
My grudge with Duan Jiu

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
isn't just about business.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So what's the real feud between you?

102
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
He killed my father.

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
It's a hatred that can't be forgiven.

104
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,760
Such a deep, bloody grudge...

105
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,840
Why didn't you tell me sooner, Shisan?

106
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
Do you want my help?

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,440
No need.

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,880
Brother He.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
You can help with anything,

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
except this revenge.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I must do it myself.

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,880
I admire your spirit.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,000
If that's so, I won't insist.

114
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,000
But about the Celestial Grotto,

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
the Guild Master has asked about it.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,840
I...

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
It's hard for me to explain.

118
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,320
Brother He.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm very grateful for your warning.

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Without you,

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
I couldn't have

122
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
taken back the whole Jin family.

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
The Celestial Grotto—

124
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,160
I'll go for you.

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,720
But I have one condition.

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Go ahead, brother.

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll support you in anything.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
I want Duan Jiu to go into the mountains with me.

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,000
I understand your intention.

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,280
That's easy.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,880
I'll arrange it right away.

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Did something big happen?

133
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,600
Why all the rush?

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
How do you still have the mood

135
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,000
to play with knives and shovels here?

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,000
What's wrong?

137
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Who took our Miss Baitao's ticket?

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
It was snatched away.

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,400
It was your lover.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,160
Jin Shisan.

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
I heard he's going into the mountains
with Duan Jiuye.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
To look for some Celestial Grotto or something.

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Who knows what's so special about it.

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
They're heading to the Celestial Temple now.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Aren't you going

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to check it out?

147
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,280
Scatter the five grains.

148
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,160
Scatter the eastern Jia and Yi wood.

149
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
From now on, every home prospers.

150
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,720
Two scatter to the south, Bing and Ding fire.

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,720
Descendants in every house prosper.

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,040
Three scatter in all directions, Geng and Xin metal.

153
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,960
Descendants gain great wealth and fortune.

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Four scatter to the north, Ren and Gui water.

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,480
Gold, pearls, and treasures pile up.

156
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,480
Five scatter to the center, Wu and Ji earth.

157
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,480
Descendants live long and prosper like Pengzu.

158
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,480
Pray to the Mountain Spirit.

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,160
Brother Jin.

160
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Don't worry.

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,240
This time into the mountains,

162
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
I, Old Luo, will protect you with my life.

163
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
I'll keep Jin safe.

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,520
When your family's injustice is finally cleared,

165
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I'll return to your grave.

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Pour a pot of old wine.

167
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,800
We'll have a good drink together.

168
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,480
Immortals above,

169
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
please bless my brother Jin.

170
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,040
Let Chief Luo's journey go smoothly.

171
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,040
If I don't make it back this time,

172
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
please let my sister Haiyue marry well.

173
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,040
May she be happy all her life.

174
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Mountain Spirit,

175
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,280
please protect us, turn misfortune to luck.

176
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,160
Great fortune and prosperity.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
Also, keep Eunhee safe and sound.

178
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
Jin Shisan.

179
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
Whatever you want to do,

180
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,920
may the Mountain Spirit help you succeed.

181
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
Mountain Spirit above,

182
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,280
Jin Shisan of Jin Family Ginseng House,

183
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,360
bows here today with family and friends.

184
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,840
I dare not ask for much.

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,520
Just wish for blessings on Luo Shanqi,

186
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,600
Yan Baobao, Cui Haiyue, Ruyi, all four.

187
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,600
May we go and return together.

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
Turn misfortune to fortune.

189
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
Ancestors of the Jin family above,

190
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,960
our clan died here, wronged for years.

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,160
The truth is still unknown.

192
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
I, Shisan, am ashamed before you.

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
But I've never forgotten all these years.

194
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,960
This time, I must find the truth.

195
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,520
Restore justice to the Jin family.

196
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Jin Shisan.

197
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,720
Don't worry, I'm not here for answers.

198
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,240
In my heart,

199
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,920
I already know the answer.

200
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
But this has nothing to do with you.

201
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,040
You don't have to go.

202
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
Last Grand Mountain Assembly,

203
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,400
you said I wanted fame,

204
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,480
you were risking your life.

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,840
We're on different paths.

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,920
I came today to tell you

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
from now on,

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
your business is my business.

209
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
Wherever you go, I go.

210
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
To the ends of the earth, through fire and blade,

211
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
I'll be with you.

212
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,480
Yang.

213
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,800
Second Miss Yang.

214
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,920
Ruyi.

215
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,600
Call me Ruyi.

216
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm just an ordinary woman.

217
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,240
I want to share my beloved's burdens.

218
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
If you don't want that,

219
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,720
I'll leave right now.

220
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,720
And never see you again.

221
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,040
If you do,

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,600
let me go with you this time.

223
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,800
Alright.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,360
Let's go, let's move.

225
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,840
Haiyue.

226
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,520
I got this at the Earth Temple.

227
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,160
It's especially effective.

228
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Before, with Brother Jin,

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
when we dug for Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

230
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,280
I wore it then.

231
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Now you wear it.

232
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,800
Okay.

233
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,160
With this talisman on me,

234
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,840
you'd better stick close to me.

235
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,480
Time to get to work.

236
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,640
You don't have to take risks with me.

237
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
It's because there's danger

238
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
that I want to be with you.

239
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,240
Alright.

240
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,240
Fine.

241
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
The goal is clear now.

242
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,840
No need to split up.

243
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,720
We'll follow your lead.

244
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,720
Go with you.

245
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,040
Since that's the case,

246
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
let's take the old route.

247
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
This is the way.

248
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Duan Jiuye might have a tough time.

249
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,280
Back when I went to the mountains with your dad,

250
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,400
you hadn't even grown all your teeth.

251
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,280
Enough talk.

252
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Lead the way.

253
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,960
Alright.

254
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,280
Let's go.

255
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,960
We're off.

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,520
Okay.

257
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay.

258
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,600
Eunhee.

259
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Take care of yourself.

260
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Mind your own business.

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:13,960
Go.

262
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,600
We're here.

263
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,960
I'll go down first.

264
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
I'll wait for you below.

265
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,160
Let's get our gear down too.

266
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes, alright, yes.

267
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Come, let's do it together.

268
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Give me a hand, come on.

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,400
Go, go.

270
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
The skin, get the skin.

271
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Here.

272
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,480
Go.

273
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,920
Go, let's go, move.

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Eunhee, get up.

275
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,720
Jin Shisan.

276
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Did you pick this route
on purpose?

277
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Such a tough path
to walk?

278
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,720
Trying to wear us out?

279
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,280
Eunhee.

280
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,400
This really is the path
we took last time.

281
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,280
Up ahead is the shelter
we built before.

282
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,960
No.

283
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,480
Can you stop using
your narrow mind

284
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,160
to judge people?

285
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,920
Come here, come on.

286
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,840
Come here.

287
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,600
Eunhee.

288
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,960
Boss Jin does things
openly and honestly.

289
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,280
He wouldn't use
underhanded tricks.

290
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,280
If he really did that,

291
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
what good would it
do him?

292
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm just carrying out
someone's request.

293
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Fulfilling a duty
for another.

294
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Besides,

295
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,040
how could I let my brother
suffer for nothing?

296
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
The shelter we built
is just ahead.

297
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
It's getting late.

298
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,960
Let's head over
and eat quickly.

299
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,040
Let's go.

300
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,800
Let's move.

301
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
Here, I've washed it.

302
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,520
There's not enough wood.

303
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Go gather some
yourself.

304
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,800
That's odd.

305
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,400
Eunhee.

306
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Eat with us.

307
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,640
No need.

308
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
Who knows what spices
you've added?

309
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
You think we're
being nice to you?

310
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,360
You...

311
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,840
I really doubt you
and Haiyue share a mother.

312
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,600
Speaking of this
southern slope,

313
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,040
Old Master Yang knows
it best.

314
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,720
Old Master Yang.

315
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,400
He came here for the
Grand Mountain Assembly
five years ago.

316
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
He didn't have the skill
or the luck.

317
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,520
Entered the Celestial Grotto
but took no treasure.

318
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,240
He thought he was
being discreet.

319
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
But he forgot about
the Changbai Ginseng Guild.

320
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,520
Nothing escapes
my eyes.

321
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,440
Let's eat.
