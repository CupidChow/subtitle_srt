Gu Dequan, come out!

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
- What do you want?
- Come out!

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,760
Let's talk it out.

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,000
Gu Dequan, come out!

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
Hear me out! Believe me!

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,240
You can talk to me.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,960
Gu Dequan! Gu Dequan!

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,600
Let's go, Mom.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,080
Come.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,840
Here.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,200
We will explain everything!

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,880
Go home! We will explain everything.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,960
Hear me out.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,200
It's a misunderstanding.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
- It's a false rumor!
- What misunderstanding?

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,560
You can trust me on this.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,360
Let's talk.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
Trust me. Please leave.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,560
Please leave. I will explain everything!

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,800
Come out!

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,040
Jing.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,840
The whole village thinks

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,120
you're smart and capable.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
You sold the fruits

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
at a price several times higher.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,800
I am so proud of you.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,800
Mom.

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,080
Your enemy hasn't made a move.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,850
Maybe they are
preparing something worse.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,680
Calm down.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,640
Jing.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,360
What should we do next?

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,840
I haven't decided yet, Mom.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,040
Very well.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Dig in.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,560
Thank you.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,160
Good morning.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
Clothes, shoes, and bags.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,560
And cosmetics.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,120
These are all yours.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,480
What is the meaning of this?

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,240
I talked to Jiahui about

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,480
how you conspired with Li Xiaolian.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
We are not telling his mother.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,760
Just tell her.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,160
I was tricked into doing it.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
Don't be so stubborn.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,440
After much thinking,

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,840
you have to get a proper job.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,520
You can't keep wasting your life away.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,400
I have an idea.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
Jiahui and I will pay

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,850
for you to get a bakery
course in Shanghai.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Or maybe a modeling course.

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,120
What do you think?

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
Don't be so full of yourself.

58
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,880
The school fees will cost a fortune.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Chen Guihua will never agree with it.

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,560
You don't understand your aunt.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,920
She isn't like that.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
I know she will say yes.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
She isn't as mean

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
as her words.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,080
If she didn't say yes,

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,760
there'd be one reason.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,400
She'd probably

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
miss you too much.

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
We can find out.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,160
How?

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,560
- Get me some someday.
- The corn is now on the market.

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,160
Get me some.

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
This tastes good.

74
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,520
Take some.

75
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,560
The corn is on the market.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,160
Really?

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,600
What's wrong?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,600
Silly girl.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,840
Try some.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,790
- This tastes good.
- Thanks.

81
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
What is it you want?

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,240
Chun

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
is an adult now.

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
She should get married.

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
But she doesn't have a suitor.

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,360
She is just a kid.

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,440
She doesn't have a job or a skill.

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,280
She can't keep wasting her life away.

89
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
That has been my concern for years.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
So,

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
what skill should she get?

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,680
Skill?

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,840
Forget about it.

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
Any course will cost thousands.

95
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,200
You wouldn't say yes.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm not as stingy as you think.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
I even have her dowry ready.

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,520
I've saved up
a hundred thousand for her.

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
A hundred thousand?

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,640
I've raised her for years.

101
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
She is like a daughter to me.

102
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,400
We might squabble sometimes,

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
but we are very close.

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Sure.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll send her

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
to Shanghai soon.

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,760
Shanghai?

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,520
No.

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
That's too far away.

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,840
You'll miss her?

111
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,840
She has never left home
for somewhere so far away.

112
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,480
What about when she gets married?

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
She has to travel far.

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,320
She is too young for that.

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,400
She will get bullied for sure.

116
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,450
Are you going to
take care of her forever?

117
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,000
If she's fine with it,

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,040
what's wrong with living with me?

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,320
I can take care of her.

120
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Aunt.

121
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,800
Aunt.

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,840
You're too nice to me.

123
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,640
I know what I did wrong.

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
I'll accept my punishment.

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
It's all right.

126
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,400
It's all right, girl.

127
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,240
Aunt.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Don't cry.

129
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,640
It's all right.

130
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
Come on, Chun.

131
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,240
Jing.

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,240
Stop crying.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,600
If you want to
study in Shanghai, go ahead.

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,080
I can afford it.

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Remember to come home often.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
I got it, Aunt.

137
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
But...

138
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
There's something I haven't told you.

139
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
What is it?

140
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
Well...

141
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,960
This is it.
