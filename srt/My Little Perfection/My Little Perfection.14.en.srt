(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

2
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
Who is it?

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,480
Mom.

5
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
Mom, it's me.

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,240
Jing.

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,600
Have you seen Jiahui?

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,880
Jiahui?

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,560
He's out of bed?

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,320
He woke up before you did?

11
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,960
Never mind, Mom.

12
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,920
I'll look for him.

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,930
What's the matter?

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,480
Jiahui never came home last night.

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
He's an adult.

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,280
He's probably all right.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
You can go back to sleep.

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,640
Thanks.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,640
Mr. Gu, a token of appreciation.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
Thank you for the help.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Xiaolian.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Keep the money safe.

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,760
Fruit farmers

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
can't have a backlog.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,760
They would rather sell
at a much lower price.

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,440
We couldn't sell our cherries.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
But Mr. Gu contacted the buyers for us.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,160
He helped a lot of people.

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,600
Don't mention it.

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,880
Don't worry.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,280
The buyers I contacted

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,800
will give you the best price.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
You know you can trust me.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
Yeah.

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,280
See them off.

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
This way.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,400
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
(Cursed Gu Dequan.)

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
(He'd go as far
as to exploit the villagers.)

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,040
Jing.

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,920
You're here too.

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Have a seat.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,520
Sure.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,720
Jing.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
You still haven't

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
properly checked out the village.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,800
I think

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,360
the weather is nice today.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
Let's take a stroll.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,720
Sure.

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
No problem.

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
Sit tight.

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,800
Certainly.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,040
Mr. Gu.

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,320
You're looking spirited today.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,560
Not bad.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,120
This is my daughter-in-law.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,600
She is from the city.

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
(Did Gu Dequan)

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,820
(take me out
to show me off to the villagers?)

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,640
See the houses, the plantation,

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,360
and the crop field?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
These are all mine.

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
If you'll become a mother,

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
these can be yours.

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
I've made it very clear.

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
A child shouldn't be used
as a tool to get the family wealth

68
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,920
or to fulfill anyone's desire.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,280
That would be unfair to the child.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,840
Yu Jing.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,080
I've given you many chances.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
You failed

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,160
to cherish it.

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,400
Mr. Gu!

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,080
Yu Jing!

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
How could you?

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,440
How could you hurt

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
your father-in-law?

79
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,680
You're evil.

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Gu! Are you hurt?
I'll help you up.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Come on.

82
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
You are too vile!

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,080
He is dying from cancer.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
How could you do this to him?

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
He fell on his own.

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,120
Liar!

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,480
I saw you pushing him!

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
Who would risk their life for this?

89
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,400
Yeah. We saw the whole thing.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
She pushed him.

91
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,160
See? There are witnesses!

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,240
But I...

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,440
Nonsense!

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,840
Jing is not a bad person.

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,840
She would never do such a thing.

96
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,570
Let's go.

97
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,560
Let's leave.

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,760
Jing.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,080
I know this is Gu Dequan's dirty trick.

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Just ignore him.

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Mom.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
Thank you for believing me.

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,160
Have you found Jiahui?

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,200
Jiahui?

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,400
You haven't found him?

106
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,680
But...

107
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,320
But...

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,840
Where could he be?
