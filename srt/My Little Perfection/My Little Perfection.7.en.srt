=Episode 7=

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,640
Here.

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,720
Here.

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,240
Hello?

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,480
I sent you the video.

7
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,150
I'll leave the rest to you, Mom.

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
Aren't you a famous star?

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,920
You bought so many things.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,080
It must cost a lot.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,800
Have you

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,720
become friends with Xiao Shan?

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
No, it's not true.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,890
You're hiding from me.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
I could tell last night

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
that you and Xiao Shan
must have something going on.

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,160
Actually,

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,400
I don't mind if your brother
divorces your sister-in-law.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,480
I just want to find a good woman

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,640
to give me a grandchild.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,520
What do you

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
think of Xiao Shan?

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,400
She's pretty good.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,880
Yes, she's good,

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
but she's a bit scheming.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,880
Shan.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
Think carefully.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,080
Did he come at 6 PM or 8 PM?

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,160
Since he was the one who forced you,

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
how come there is
a lipstick mark on his neck?

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,000
I...

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,760
I...

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
I don't know.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,720
I...

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
I was

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,200
probably drunk too.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
I really can't remember.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,920
You must remember, my dear.

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,520
The police will ask
about these details later.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't force me.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,120
Since you already know he's a scum,

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,240
let's just let this go.

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
All right.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,600
I won't ask anymore.

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Calm down.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Have a sip of water and calm down.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Last night,

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,440
we were both in a daze.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,800
At first,

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,280
I thought you set it up.

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Then I realized

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,360
it couldn't be.

53
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,640
You're not that smart.

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
Who?

55
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
Are you looking down on me?

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Of course.

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,760
Out of the four of us in our family,
aren't you the dumbest?

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,200
You didn't get into college
and don't have a stable job.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,960
Look at Xiao Shan.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,840
She has a high IQ and EQ.
What a beauty in the modern city.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
She's just so-so.

62
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,990
If it weren't for me,

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,680
she wouldn't succeed.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,280
All right.

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,720
So you both
are really working with each other.

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,280
Tell me!

67
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,040
What did she give you?

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,720
Not much.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
Just five thousand.

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Xiao Shan and I got Jiahui drunk

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
and knocked him out.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Then we sent him to Xiao Shan's house.

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
You're so dumb.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,480
How does your brother
divorcing his wife benefit you?

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
Didn't you also cause chaos to them?

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,520
I...

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm just following you.

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,200
You...

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
You brat!

80
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,660
(Record)

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,680
Hello?

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Jiahui.

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,520
I got the evidence from Yu Chun.

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,300
(Record)

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,760
I went to see Shan yesterday.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
Why did you come?

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,080
To make a deal with you.

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Just based on this?

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
Yes.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If Jing sees it,
she'll definitely divorce my brother.

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
It's quite impactful.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,200
So,

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
you should give me three thousand.

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,240
I'll give you five thousand.

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
Help me with something.

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,000
(So, I went to find my brother.)
Open the window!

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Why?

98
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,990
Shan wants to meet you.

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
(I took him to Shan's house.)

100
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,680
(Later, I called you.)

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,640
Hello?

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,960
You woke up.

103
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,920
(I locked my brother in the room.)

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Open the door, Chun.

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
(I heard noises from the outside.)

106
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,600
Calm down.

107
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Tell me,

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
do you like

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,480
the gentle way

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
or

111
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
the exciting way?

112
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
(I swear nothing happened between them.)

113
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Why don't you turn around?

114
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
Let me tell you what I like.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
Such a playboy.

116
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
(After that...)

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
(You know the rest.)

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,760
So why did you and Xiao Shan do this?

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,560
I don't know why Xiao Shan did this.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
I did it for money,

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,360
as you know.

122
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,600
It's just five thousand.

123
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
It's all here.

124
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,080
Even rabbits know not to eat
near where they live.

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
She wants to be the third party.

126
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,320
I'll go find Xiao Shan
and clarify things.

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,920
I consider you my best friend.

128
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,740
Why did you want
to break up me and Gu Jiahui?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,520
How much have you
suffered during this time?

130
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't you know?

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,760
This is my life, Shan.

132
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
You shouldn't interfere
with my life, okay?

133
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Shouldn't I?

134
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,800
Didn't we agree to focus
on our careers together?

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
You promised me at the time.

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
We'll definitely secure this project.

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
It's a rare opportunity we fought for.

138
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,960
How can we turn things around
now that it's become like this?

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
It's because of
these things dragging you down

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
that we missed the opportunity.

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,960
Shan.

142
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,280
Let's just split up.

143
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
I'll have a lawyer settle the assets.

144
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,440
I'll give you what you deserve

145
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
according to your shares.

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
How could you give up on our business

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
for Gu Jiahui?

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,200
You're my best friend,

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
but he's my family.

150
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
Why do you keep forcing me to choose?

151
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm sorry, Jing.

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,440
Jing.

153
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,400
Jing, I was wrong, sorry.

154
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,840
I didn't mean

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,520
to break you and Jiahui apart.

156
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
A major investor approached me.

157
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,000
She said she would give us
a large sum of money

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,720
as long as you don't have a child.

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,520
Once we have the money,

160
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,880
we'll realize our dreams.

161
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
Not having a child?

162
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Hello, Darling.

163
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,050
Xiao Shan said there's an investor.

164
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Hello, Miss Li.

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,800
I've arranged to meet my partner
at our usual place.

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,640
Miss Li.

167
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,000
It's you?

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Well.

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,640
I was wondering who's behind this.

170
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
It turns out to be you, a mistress!
