(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,880
Look at the time now.

4
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,080
Hurry up and come over here.

5
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,120
Mom.

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,400
You're being rude.

7
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,190
The male host hasn't started eating yet,
and you're already eating.

8
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
He's your host, not mine.

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
What are you saying?

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
Stand up now!

11
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,000
So what?

12
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Who do you think you are?

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
Why are you bossing around here?

14
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
Who am I?

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,190
I'm the hostess
of this house, do you understand?

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,080
Mom.

17
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,960
- Mom!
- Hostess?

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Kneel!

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,890
It's the modern era,
why are you still making people kneel?

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,700
When can the younger generation

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,040
interfere in the elderly's affairs?

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Child.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,480
Since your parents didn't teach you,

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
let me teach you.

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
When visiting someone's home,

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
it's unreasonable

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,920
to wake up later than the host

28
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,440
and shout around.

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Are you saying the elderly can't interfere
in the young people's affairs?

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,450
Then your wanting to have a grandchild
has nothing to do with us, right?

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Of course,

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,520
especially for those with bad manners.

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Let's sit.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Mom, have a seat.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,320
Sit.

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,920
There's no need to be polite.
We're not guests.

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,600
We're here to collect a debt.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,110
There's no need for formalities.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,600
You...

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,800
Lian.

41
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Don't be too calculative.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
They'll understand sooner or later.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,960
Without rules, there's no order.

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
Not following the rules

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,160
will lead to losses.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
Are what you said rules?

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,580
Aren't those outdated customs?

48
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
That's awesome!

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm so happy!

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,240
I've never seen him look so grim before.

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,680
Mom.

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,360
With us here, you don't have to
be afraid of him anymore.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
Why be afraid?

54
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,560
What's he going to do to you?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,640
Thank you.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
After all these years,

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,960
I can finally breathe smoothly.

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,000
Mom.

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
I just checked the yard.

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,490
The corridor light bulb is loose,
and there're wild cats in the yard.

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,440
There's no ghost.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,600
I think

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
all of this is done by Gu Dequan.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
See, Mom?

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
What did I say?

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,400
There are no ghosts in this world.

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,700
You have to believe in science.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
I believe in you.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
Whatever you say is right.

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
They're really outrageous.

72
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,990
They dare to treat you like this.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Chen Guihua is too foolish.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,560
She can't handle Yu Jing.

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,480
You do it.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,990
It doesn't matter whether she
or Chunsheng's family have a kid first,

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
as long as someone gives birth,

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
the family property will be yours.

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
All right, don't worry.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,320
I'll handle it.

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,600
Here, drink this.

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
What's this?

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
This is a nourishing soup.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
It nourishes your body.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
No, thank you.

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
What do you mean?

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,840
You must drink it.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,990
This was specially bought
for you by your father.

89
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
Let me tell you,

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,960
my father would never force me
to drink such strange things.

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,640
If I want to have a child,

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,680
it's my own choice.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,480
Even my own parents

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
can't force me.

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,080
You...

96
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,280
You're outrageous.

97
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
Who's the master?

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
Times have changed.

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,400
It's best for you
to care more about yourselves.

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,330
The mindset of the previous generation
can't restrict young people's freedom.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,720
Your ideas can't control us.

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's go.

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
Why didn't you dodge just now?

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
You're next to me, why would I dodge?

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,680
This way, it's cooler and more imposing.

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,040
So you were using my care
for you to show off.

107
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
(Local cherry  40 yuan/kg)

108
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
So many cherries.

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,840
How much is your cherry per catty?

110
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,290
Are you the daughter-in-law
of the Gu family?

111
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,890
It's free for you,
take as much as you want.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,960
Why is it free
for the Gu family's daughter-in-law?

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,090
Every year, the sales
of our cherries are bad.

114
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,090
All thanks to Mr. Gu
who contacted buyers for us.

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
He helped many of us.

116
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
We couldn't thank him more.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
How could we ask you for money?

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Bad sales?

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Gu.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Calm down.

121
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,760
Your health is important.

122
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
Take your medicine.

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,240
No!

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
No one has ever dared

125
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
to oppose me like this.

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,200
Go.

127
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
Give Yu Jing a lesson.

128
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,240
All right, I understand.
