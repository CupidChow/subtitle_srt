(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,620
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,720
Jiahui, you woke up.

4
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,840
Jing.

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,440
You brat!

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
- You brat!
- Mom!

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,600
Mom!

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,040
You unfilial child!

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,040
- Mom!
- Aunt!

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,960
You know I hate cheating men
the most in my life.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,560
- Aunt!
- You're just like your father!

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,320
It's all a misunderstanding.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,560
- It really wasn't me.
- Aunt!

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,680
How dare you cheat with other women?

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Wait, let me explain.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,720
Wait.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,080
Jing.

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,160
Take this.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,160
Hit him hard to vent your anger.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
Let me explain.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,160
It's all a misunderstanding, Jing.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,120
Gu Jiahui.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,560
I want to hear your explanation.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,680
This is all a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,120
I...

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,320
I was drunk

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,170
and I got knocked out.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,450
Then, I woke up like this.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,090
Don't believe me? Ask Chun.

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,200
I don't know anything.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,120
Gu Jiahui. What are you trying to defend?

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,200
You were the one
who texted me to complain.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,190
You were the one who refused
to leave when you were drunk.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Jing, look.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
This is the evidence.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
This is the good man you talked about.

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,700
(Shan, are home?
Let's have a drink.)

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
I have evidence too.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
She asked me to look
at the contract, that's why I came.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,760
I have evidence.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
It was deleted.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,390
Someone must have
deleted it from my phone.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,280
I really didn't send it, Jing.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
This is your true self, isn't it?

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
No, it's not.

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,800
There's no need to say anything more.

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's get a divorce.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Jing, don't go.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,760
- Jing, it's really not like that.
- Jing.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,600
Jing!

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,160
Jing.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
Don't worry.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880
I will accompany you

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
through this difficult time.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,240
Let's focus on our careers in the future

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
and be good friends for life.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,480
Jing is back.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Darling.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,400
Listen to me, listen to my explanation.

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,560
The message was sent

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,560
at 8 PM.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,310
But I arrived
at Xiao Shan's house at 6 PM.

63
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,480
The real message was deleted.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
It wasn't the one you saw.

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,960
Besides, why would I have an affair
with your good friend behind your back?

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,240
That's right, Jing.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Divorce is such a big deal.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
It can't be said casually.

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,320
Jing.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,120
Jing.

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,600
Listen to me.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,990
Meet at the Civil Affairs Bureau
tomorrow morning.

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,440
Listen to me.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,640
No way.

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600
I mustn't get a divorce.

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
I have to prove my innocence.

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,840
Mom.

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
You have to help me, okay?

79
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,500
(Four years ago)

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
(Darling, trust me.)

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,950
(I will definitely prove my innocence.)

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
I was drunk, and then I got knocked out.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,880
Then, I woke up like this.

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,950
You were the one
who texted me to complain.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,690
You were the drunk one who refused
to leave.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
This is the evidence.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
This is the good man you talked about.

88
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,760
(Jiahui doesn't like
to use punctuation marks.)

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
(Was it him
who sent the message that day?)

90
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,320
Jing.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Shan.

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,640
I thought about it carefully last night.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
You're my best friend,

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't let you be wronged.

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Look.

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,080
Gu Jiahui is such a scum.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
I must make him go to jail.

98
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,200
You...

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,120
Are you planning to call the police?

100
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,440
Of course.

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Shan.

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,680
You have to tell me everything

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,840
that happened that night.

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
We can't let him get away.

105
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,550
I will definitely stand by your side.

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
You've been wronged.
