(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

2
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,240
You went to the city today.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,000
You ran out of medicine.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
I went to get you more.

6
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,920
Why didn't you tell me?

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
You were still asleep this morning.

8
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,760
I...

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,360
This should teach you a lesson!

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
There's something I haven't told you.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,520
What is it?

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
Well...

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,800
This is it.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,080
What is this?

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,320
Li Xiaolian's dirty little secret.

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
Her son, Gu Chunsheng,

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,240
isn't Gu Dequan's son.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
Heaven is fair to us all!

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,240
Karma found its way to him!

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Mom.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,360
I want the world to see this!

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,640
Mom!

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
I want the world to see this!

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,800
Mom.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Aunt.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
You can't do this.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
Why not?

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Why can't I?

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
I know you've endured for years.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
But doing this

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,360
would be too cruel.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,520
Gu Dequan is a loathsome man,

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,680
but he is dying from cancer.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
For him,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
raising someone else's son

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,960
is already retribution.

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,200
We can't decimate him with this secret.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040
He is evil!

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
He deserves this.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,640
Mom.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,440
Jing.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I can't...

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,560
I...

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
I can't swallow this!

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,560
He lied to me and hurt me.

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,920
He robbed me of my dowry.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,760
I've suffered so much in this life.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,120
I want him to know

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,480
he's done me wrong.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,600
He owes it to me!

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,680
Mom.

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,080
You can't just sit and watch

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,680
as Li Xiaolian takes from us.

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,280
We've suffered so much because of her.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Will you do nothing
and let her bully me?

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,040
I will never rest in peace

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
until I get my share of the will!

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Mom, don't worry.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,720
He will see the error of his way.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,480
Chun.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
We will work together as a family.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
We will give you
the justice you deserve.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,760
Yeah.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,080
We will take your side and help you.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't cry, Mom.

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Chun.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
I didn't think you'd contact me.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
I was

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
terrified the other day.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,520
That's why I put the blame on you.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
You are their family.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,840
They'd never call the police on you.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,280
This tastes good. Try some.

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,960
No.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
I don't want your snack.

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,690
We'll go our separate ways.

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Why?

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,120
You are too dense.

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait, Chun!

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,960
Explain yourself.

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,200
You are

82
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,080
too nice to the man.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
The more you care,

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
the more he ignores you.

85
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
Gu Dequan

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
will never give you a cent.

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,780
Don't believe me?

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,760
We'll see about that.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,040
Chun!

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
I am making money to
pay for my husband's medical bill.

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
He has cancer.

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
He doesn't have much time left.

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,520
The villagers have misunderstood him.

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
He has cancer,

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,960
so I want to earn as much as I can

96
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
to get him treated.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
Sorry, everybody.

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
I have a guest.

99
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,560
See you next time.

100
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,840
Goodbye, everybody.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
Live-streaming?

102
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,200
What do you want?

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
I do live-streams, too.

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,320
I bet your sad cancer story

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
garnered a lot of fans.

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
Why do you care?

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
You've made a fortune.

108
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,840
But sadly,

109
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,960
your husband took everything.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
You never got paid a cent.

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,400
How do you know?

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,160
(Just as I expected.)

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,820
Anyone in the right mind can tell.

114
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
You see him as your husband,

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
but you're just a free caretaker to him.

116
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,920
No!

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
The cherries look nice.

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,280
Take it easy!

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
You can't even wash my feet!

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
You're useless!

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
You see him as your husband,

122
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,880
but you're just a free caretaker to him.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Li Xiaolian.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Are you out of your mind?

125
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,320
Yes!

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,400
You will pay for my service every day!

127
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,240
Otherwise,

128
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,640
I'll never serve you for free!

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,200
Xiaolian!

130
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,400
You...

131
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Come back here!

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,840
Come back!
