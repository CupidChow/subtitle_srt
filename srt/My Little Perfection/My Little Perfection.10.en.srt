(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,800
I've rented this building

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,480
for three times its price.

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,400
So,

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,480
today, you must move out!

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,780
What are you doing?

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
Tear it if you want.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,240
I have plenty.
It's useless even if you tear it.

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,920
Old mistress!

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,790
I'm going to fight you!

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,120
Mom!

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,040
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

14
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,080
- Stop it!
- You're a bully!

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,000
- Stop it!
- You're a bully!

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,360
Mom!

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Stop it!

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,000
You're a bully!

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,640
Stop it!

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,080
Mom!

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,160
Don't stop me!

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,490
- Calm down.
- I'm going to fight her!

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,680
We'll leave. You'd better not regret it.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
Regret?

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,560
I've never!

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,480
Jiahui.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
Pack up and we'll leave immediately.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,560
What should we do?

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,960
Since that's the case,
let's take Mom back.

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
No need to leave. I have a way.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,000
I know where to go.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Mom, you and Chun pack your things.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,200
This place is nice.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Where are we going?

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,120
Aunt.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
Jing and Jiahui are going
to your ex-husband's house.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,920
To his house?

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Jing.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
We can't go there.

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,320
Let's just find a random place

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,400
or sleep in the car.

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,400
Mom.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,250
You just said you wanted
to expose their lair.

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,560
Why are you hesitating now?

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm just having PDF.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,640
It's PTSD,
post-traumatic stress disorder.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't care about P or D.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,320
I...

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
When I see that old man,

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,080
I'll...

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
I'll tremble.

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
Mom.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Don't be nervous.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,640
Jing and I are here.

55
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Mom.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
I'll help you.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,580
What are you doing in our house?

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,440
Get out!

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
We're staying here tonight.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
In your dreams.

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,000
Why are you nervous?

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
Weren't you confident just now?

63
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,160
She's nervous, of course.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,990
Gu Dequan wants a grandchild so badly.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,440
He won't drive us away.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,600
It's you who wants to drive us away.

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,880
You're two-faced.

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
You even drive us out.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,480
It's despicable!

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,960
Jiahui, Jing.

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
Why don't we stay in a hotel?

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Leave here now!

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
Go away!

74
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,160
Since you're here,

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
just stay.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
You've been married for three years
and still haven't had children.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,690
Have you been
to the hospital for a check-up?

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,480
We don't need a check-up.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,720
Even if it's another three years,

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
we don't plan to have children.

81
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,160
Jing.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
Don't say that.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,600
You know I don't have much time left.

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,440
My last wish before I die
is to have a grandchild.

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Just consider it
as pity for an old man like me.

86
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,560
You didn't accumulate
enough virtue in the past.

87
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,590
Now that you want to have a grandchild,

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
aren't you being too selfish?

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,920
Chen Guihua.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,920
Without me,

91
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,960
look at how you've raised your son.

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,640
I think Mom
has educated Jiahui very well.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
He's kind,

94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,480
cherishes his family,

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,160
and respects women.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,520
Lian.

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,280
This is my own son.

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
That's my daughter-in-law.

99
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,000
Show them the way.

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Let them stay as long as they like.

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,920
Let's go. This way.

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Mom, you go first.

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
Why do we have to stay here?

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,920
You two, think about what to do next.

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,480
Mom.

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,600
Let's take it step by step.

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,640
It's midnight and I'm sleepy.

108
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,240
But...

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
It's already midnight, Mom.

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,840
- Let's take it step by step.
- Tomorrow...

111
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,890
They haven't made a move yet.

112
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
Let's sleep first, okay?
Discuss it tomorrow.

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
Sleep well. Shh, don't say anything.

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,890
- How can I sleep?
- Goodnight, Mom.

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,560
Goodnight.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,720
What a bad child.

117
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,400
Do we let them stay here?

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
They are already trapped here.

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
They can only obediently
follow what we say.

120
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,960
Aunt!

121
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
You scared me, you brat!

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
Aunt! There's a ghost in the Gu family.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
I just fell asleep

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,960
and heard a baby crying.

125
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,830
Stop making things up.

126
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,720
What kind of ghost?

127
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
It's true, Aunt.

128
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,760
Last time, Xiaolian
went for an abortion.

129
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,990
It was instructed by Gu Dequan.

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Could it be...
