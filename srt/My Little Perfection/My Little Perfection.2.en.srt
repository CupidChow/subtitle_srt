00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,700
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
The doctor said

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,200
both of you have to take this medicine.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,440
Why did you vomit it?

6
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
This medicine is quite expensive.

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Are you okay?

8
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,320
The doctor
said this medicine has to be finished.

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,160
Mom.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Go to the hospital with us.

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,560
We're really worried about you.

12
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,840
Understood, Mom.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,760
Give it to me.

14
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,000
As long as I finish all the medicine,

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,360
you'll go to the hospital, right?

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,160
What?

17
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,660
We've finished the medicine.

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,790
You have to go to the hospital.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,320
Don't pour it away.

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,460
You haven't even gotten pregnant yet.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,760
Darling.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
What's wrong?

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
No way.

24
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,400
We must take her to the hospital.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Mom!

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,660
- What?
- Listen to me.

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,230
Listen to me.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,720
Mom.

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,990
- I'm not going!
- Go to the hospital.

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:33,840
Put me down!

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,690
- You must go.
- Mom!

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,790
- Put me down!
- Listen to me.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,150
- Mom.
- Don't come here.

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Calm down.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,240
Mom.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,550
- Go to the hospital!
- You promised.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
You promised
to let me have a grandchild.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
Now you're forcing me
to go to the hospital.

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,830
You must go to the hospital today.

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,280
If I don't have a grandchild,

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
what's the point of living?

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,200
- Wait!
- Mom!

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
What should we do now?

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,190
We can't let her have her way anymore.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
I know.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm also confused right now.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Have you slept?

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,400
Yes, I have.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
I prepared some milk for you
to drink before bed.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,560
Here, drink it.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
It'll make the baby fair and chubby.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,520
Mom.

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,360
I've already brushed my teeth.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
I'll drink it.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,360
No, Jiahui.

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,840
This is for you.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Come on, drink it.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
They left, don't drink it.

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,840
You had a hard time.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,520
Don't drink it next time.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Darling.

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,660
As long as
she doesn't go to the hospital,

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
we have to drink it every day.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,040
Don't you find it strange?

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
She's a cancer patient,

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
yet she looks so healthy every day.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,080
When we tried
to take her to the hospital,

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,950
she could still struggle
free from your grasp.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Is that reasonable?

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,120
How's everything at Chen Guihua's side?

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,590
Preparing for pregnancy?

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,280
We need to start taking action.

73
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,580
(Compound Vitamin B Tablets)

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,840
Who's there?

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Chun, Mom, it's me.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Jing, it's so early.

77
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,120
What's going on?

78
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Mom.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,440
Look.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
This medicine you're taking is fake.

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Were you deceived by the doctor in the hometown?

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,840
Yes.

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,880
I was fooled.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
This quack...

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,080
Look.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,160
Luckily, I found out early.

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,200
Here, Mom.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
From now on, take this.

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
What's this?

90
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,580
This is imported medicine
I bought through a friend.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Not only does it

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
prevent the spread of cancer cells,

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,240
but it also has a therapeutic effect
if taken long-term.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Imported?

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,320
It must be expensive.

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
Don't care about the price.

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
Don't worry.

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,990
Just focus on taking care
of your health.

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
Thanks, Jing.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
It's nothing, Mom.

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm telling you, Yu Jing,

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm the man in this family.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,180
Whether to sell the house
or the car is my decision.

104
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
You're a man,

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,920
but most of the money
in this family is earned by me.

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,120
When I say sell the house, we sell it.

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
That's not right.

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
Back then, Jiahui supported you
in starting your business.

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
He sold the house and the car.

110
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,040
Mom.

111
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,760
Why are you arguing with me?

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
Who was it all for?

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
Wasn't it for you?

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,880
For me?

115
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you mean?

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
To buy the medicine
worth tens of thousands yuan for you,

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,390
we had to
mortgage the car and the house.

118
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,150
Was it the medicine
Jing said this morning?

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,920
Tens of thousands?

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,040
Yes.

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,400
No, I don't need it.

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
I...

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
My illness doesn't matter.

124
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,720
Save it for my grandchild.

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
That's right, Jing.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,280
Once you mortgage the house,
where can you stay?

127
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
As long as you're healthy,

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,190
I don't need to hurry
to prepare for pregnancy.

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,890
I can earn money together with Jiahui

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,560
in the future.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,750
The contracts only need the signatures
of both parties to take effect.

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Come on, sign it.

133
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,400
I still feel something's not right.

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,830
Let's think about it again.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Gu Jiahui.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,920
Are you a man?

137
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,440
Is money or a person's life
more important?

138
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
This is your mother!

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
You're right.

140
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,840
This is my mother.

141
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,590
Even if we have to sell everything,
we must cure her illness.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,400
I'll sign.

143
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,440
No!

144
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
It's fake.

145
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
Yu Chun, tell them.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
Aunt's cancer is fake.

147
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
The medical report
was edited by someone online.

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
So, don't sell the house or the car.

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Fine.

150
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,760
I genuinely cared for you,

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
but what I got in return
was your lies, right?

152
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
I really feel sad for myself.

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,440
It's all because
you didn't have a kid in three years.

154
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,000
What can I do?

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Mom.

156
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,990
I'm not good with sweet talk.

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,840
I rarely

158
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,080
serve you and take care of you well,

159
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,320
but I give you money every year.

160
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,840
I express my filial piety in my own way.

161
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,240
However,

162
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
by doing this,

163
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,320
you've really hurt me.

164
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
Jing.

165
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
There's no need
to say anything else, Mom.

166
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,200
I want to be alone and calm down.

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Jing.

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,400
Since it's fake,

169
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
let's return the medicine.

170
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,520
The medicine?

171
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,660
It was bought online
for less than a hundred.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,790
That's calcium tablets.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,480
Gu Jiahui.

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,760
Look at this.

175
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,690
She's not sick after all.

176
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,920
Wait.

177
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,080
That's too much.

178
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
She's pretending to be sick.

179
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,600
From now on, cooperate with me.

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
This is

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,280
beating her

182
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
at her own game.

183
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,360
It smells great.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Aunt, are you planning something big?

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,800
I must let her know

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,760
that Chen Guihua
isn't easy to deal with.
