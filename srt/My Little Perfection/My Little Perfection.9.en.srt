3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,880
Madam, please have a seat.

4
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,180
I'll go in and check on my mother.

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,520
You're back.

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,200
Here.

7
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,650
- Have some sunflower seeds.
- Mom?

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,120
You're back!

9
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,880
Mom.

10
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,790
I told you he would be back, right?

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,240
Mom.

12
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,330
Weren't you involved in an accident?

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,280
I faked it.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,990
You're lying to me again.

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,000
I just want you to come back.

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,680
The relatives and friends
said they want to welcome you.

17
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,080
Show some respect.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
Come, we'll chat later.

19
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,200
Help me with some chores.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,200
Come, let's eat.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,280
Let's eat.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,920
I'm such a fool.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
You would even make up a car accident

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
to lure me back for the inheritance.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Jing.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,360
You're back now.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Don't overthink it.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,760
Stay a few more days.
I'll take you cherry-picking.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,160
The cherries here are so sweet.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,640
Stop thinking about it.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
Let me solemnly declare my stance.

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,880
I will not get involved in this matter.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,840
Yes.

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,990
I support Jing too.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
After dinner, we'll drive back.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,040
Fine.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,640
You can go back.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,480
Come.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,160
Let's eat.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
Eat more.

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
I can't keep you here either.

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,000
Eat up.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,490
I made this meal with so much effort

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,600
but you're not eating.

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Just eat it.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,720
It's not poisoned.

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,880
Look.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,320
Eat it.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
Mom, why are you laughing?

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
This dish doesn't taste right.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
There's wine in it.

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh no, I forgot.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
You two have to drive back, right?

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,320
I love to cook with wine.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
Get your coats.

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll call a ride now.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
It's not available here.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,640
Mom.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Jiahui!

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't be angry.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
I really don't understand.

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,800
What's the difference between staying
one more night or one less night?

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,600
Ignore her.

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
We'll go back early tomorrow.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,990
Look at these conditions.

66
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,920
Duh.

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Jiahui?

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
It's just an old thing.

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,260
I'll go out for a while.

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,360
Coming.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,600
Mom.

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
How could you do this?

73
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,720
- I...
- Save your effort.

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Jing won't stay.

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,240
Neither will I.

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Jiahui.

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,880
Mom, what's going on?

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
That's Gu Dequan's...

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,520
No.

80
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,160
It's Jiahui's father's old tie.

81
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,480
Jiahui has been treasuring it.

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,080
Jiahui.

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,840
Thanks.

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,490
Mom, I understand now.

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll go find him.

86
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,290
You've never told me
about these things before.

87
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,240
Don't mind her.

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
It's all childhood matters.

89
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,480
Let's go inside.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,880
Darling.

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
Let's stay.

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,680
He's dying.

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't want you to have regrets

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,000
in life.

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,360
Calm down.

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
It's all a setup by my mother.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,480
I can't let you face this pain alone.

98
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
So,

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm willing to enter this setup.

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,480
That's great, Jing!

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,640
I knew

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,560
you're a good-hearted child.

103
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,640
With our efforts,

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,680
we'll surely break that old man's plot.

105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,840
Who's there?

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Old mistress.

107
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,480
It's not the festive season now.

108
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
You don't have to be so formal.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,760
What brings you here?

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
I've rented this building

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
for three times its price.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,680
So,

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,640
today, you must move out!
