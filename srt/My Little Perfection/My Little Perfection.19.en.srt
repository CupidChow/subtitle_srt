=Episode 19=

3
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Who are these flowers from?

4
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
My son.

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
It's Mother's Day today.

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,760
My son says all mothers are noble.

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,680
Here, a flower for you.

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,280
Take it.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,840
- Happy Mother's Day.
- You too.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Li Xiaolian.

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,920
It's Mother's Day.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,440
Let's set our differences aside.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,200
Here.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,520
A flower for you.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,480
Happy Mother's Day.

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,980
I don't need that.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't throw away the beautiful flower.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Take it. It's a gift.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,040
We saw everything that day.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
We saw how that fiend

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,280
treated you.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,920
I have some medicine in my room.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,320
I'll get it for you.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,340
You've gone through
a lot over the decades.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,760
Here.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,280
Take this.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,280
See? It's a rose.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
It has thorns.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
If he ever hits you again,

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
prick him with this flower.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,460
- Happy Mother's Day.
- I don't need it.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,560
You're welcome.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,360
What is that?

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,040
A rose.

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,560
Where did you get it?

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,960
It's Mother's Day.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
This is a gift.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,660
Are you worthy

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
of celebrating Mother's Day?

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Why not?

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,550
You have only given birth
to one over the past 30 years.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,600
You think you're worthy?

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
If your belly was any good,

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,440
I would've had a big family.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,890
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm here to Chen Guihua.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,560
She is not here.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Who is visiting at this hour?

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,640
Guihua.

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,980
What are you doing here?

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
I made some snacks.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,870
I hope you like them.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Who cares about your snacks?

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
What's wrong with your hand?

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,440
It's nothing.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
Just some small cuts.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,000
Sister.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,360
I've thought it through.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,280
Perhaps

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,800
we can join hands.

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,160
Guihua.

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,390
Women shouldn't make life difficult
for each other.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Very well.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,440
Aunt!

65
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
How can you say yes so easily?

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Don't take it too lightly.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
You know nothing.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,040
Do you know how we suffered
back in the days

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
and how Gu Dequan mistreated us?

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,200
Xiaolian.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,840
Come.

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
We'll talk inside.

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,160
How does it taste?

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,240
This is pretty good.

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,180
Eat as much as you want.

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Look at that stinky old geezer.

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,600
He thinks he's above us all

78
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,400
and acts like an emperor
now that he is rich.

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,400
Indeed.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,880
You know what?

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,240
He has other mistresses.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,360
Other mistresses?

83
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Disgusting!

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
Where are your son and his wife?

86
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,240
I overate.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,490
- Take it slowly.
- Try some of these.

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
What is taking them so long?

89
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,390
Did they run into Li Xiaolian?

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,120
They are back.

91
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,990
Did Li Xiaolian suspect anything?

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,090
Chunsheng doesn't want
to be part of this.

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
He said yes instantly.

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Don't worry, Mom.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Tomorrow,

96
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
we'll stir up a huge commotion.

97
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes.

98
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
Tomorrow,

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,200
we will proceed as planned.

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes.

102
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
Hello? Chunsheng?

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,800
How is it going?

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Mom, I've told you.

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
I can't have children.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,590
I don't want the inheritance.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Don't be silly.

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
Stop forcing me.

109
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,200
I only want to live my life.

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
- Hurry!
- Okay.

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,160
- I'm on my way.
- Over here.

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,840
- Quick!
- Wait.

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,720
Quick.

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
Quick! Slay it!

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Over here!

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,640
Not there!

117
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,520
It's here. See that?

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
You took the wrong path, pal.

119
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Did I?

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,800
Wait.

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,880
What now?

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
Now that you've ruined my reputation,

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,680
are you taking my house too?

124
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,880
Dad.

125
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,960
Don't say that.

126
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
I thought you'd feel

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
too lonely here.

128
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
So, Jiahui and I came to
keep you company.

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah.

130
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
If Jing didn't convince me,

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
I'd hate to spend another minute here.

132
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Carry on.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,400
Rush!

134
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm coming.

135
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Dad.

136
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
The thing is,

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,160
Jiahui is your son by blood.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,720
It's our duty to take care of you
in your final days.

139
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,400
Right?

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
It's getting late.

141
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
We should head back.
