=My Little Perfection=
(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

2
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,580
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,600
How is it?

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
The fetal heartbeat is very strong,
indicating a vigorous vitality.

5
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,760
Listen to it.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,360
Let me listen.

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
That's true.

8
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,180
Later, there'll be
an important live broadcast

9
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,390
that determines
whether we can secure the investment.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
Gu Jiahui didn't think
about helping you with this.

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,600
He's actually

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,520
pretty good to me.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,720
You're

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,240
a hopeless romantic.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,560
If you had put
this much effort into your career,

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,720
the company would have expanded by now.

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,320
We wouldn't be dealing with this mess.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,800
Forget it.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,750
Are you still trying
to convince me to divorce?

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,000
I won't.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
I'll fight to the end.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,960
(Jing, don't worry.)

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,590
(I'll definitely save you from this mess.)

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,280
Anyway, I've already
given the machine to Jing.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,960
Whenever you want to use it,

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
just use it.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,960
Xiao Shan, you're so kind.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,360
It's nothing, Madam.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
Jing is pregnant now.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,760
She needs to go out
and get some sun for calcium.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,200
She needs to attend the maternity school

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
to learn how to take care of newborns.

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,540
Yes, go to a maternity school.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,880
There's a good one nearby.

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,390
I heard the reviews are good too.

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,790
I'll pay the fee in the afternoon.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Go, you must go.

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,520
Thank you, Miss Xiao.

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,480
Jing can rest assured now.

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,240
You'd better
send your mother away quickly.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
You can fool her
with a fake pregnancy just for a while,

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
but not forever.

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
Do well in the live broadcast later.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,660
I'll meet the investors first.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,240
Aunt!

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
I discovered something!

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
What could you have discovered?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
You don't understand.

49
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,800
The fetal heart rate monitor

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
is quite useful.

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,240
This time, her pregnancy
is one hundred percent real.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
Mom, I'm going
to register at the maternity school.

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
- I won't be back for dinner.
- Okay!

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,520
Be careful.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm also going out.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Where are you going?

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,980
The samples are all at the back.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Xiao Shan has already
gone to meet the clients,

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
and the venue is all set up.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,200
We can go there directly.

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,320
I hope this will be successful

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,680
so that we can expand our company.

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,040
Then, we can buy a house and a car.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,560
I just don't know

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
when these troublesome matters
will come to an end.

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Don't worry, Darling.

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
I won't hold you back.

68
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,800
Considering
your good performance recently,

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll forgive you.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,600
Let's go.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,120
Are you Miss Li?

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
I understand your situation.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
I like your hosts.

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm willing to invest

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,400
this amount.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,160
However,

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
I have some concerns.

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
You're extorting us.

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,280
What?

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
You are my own cousin and cousin-in-law.

81
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,000
I helped you to keep the secret
of your fake pregnancy from Aunt.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,470
What are you doing sneaking out?

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Take me with you.

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,520
Tell me.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,040
What are you up to?

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,640
I want to become an internet celebrity.

87
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,880
I'm sure I can become
a famous top internet celebrity.

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,840
Hurry up.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
Otherwise,

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,760
I'll tell Jing that you're hiding money.

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,280
Shh.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,800
It's all here.

93
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,590
Another thousand for you.

94
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,640
Don't follow us.

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,880
Leave now.

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,640
Thanks.

97
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,320
What were you just talking about?

98
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Nothing.

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,520
She's still young
and isn't well-behaved.

100
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,360
Later, Mr. Zhao and the investor
will enter the live broadcast room.

101
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,320
When the live broadcast starts,

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,590
I'll give you a cue.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
We must do our best

104
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,720
and get the business done.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
Here, take this.

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
All the best!

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,350
All right.

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,800
It's starting.

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,720
Hello, everyone. I'm Jiahui.

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm Jing's husband.

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
Today, let me introduce
this baby product to you.

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,960
I hope all fathers and mothers

113
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,760
can join us in our discussion.

114
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,160
As you can see, the atmosphere
in our live stream is very good.

115
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,720
The host has very rich experience.

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,520
Moreover, after this live stream ends,

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,240
we will have long-term cooperation

118
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,450
with one of the top five global
mother and baby brands.

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,040
Hello, dear fathers and mothers,

120
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm Jing.

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Next, let's showcase our products.

122
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
This baby carrier

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,360
can protect the mother's waist

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
and prevent injuries,

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
making it easier and more convenient

126
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
to carry the baby.

127
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,360
Next,

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
we want to introduce to you...

129
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
What are you doing?

130
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,680
It's very eco-friendly.

131
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Hello, dear mothers.

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,360
Please remember our product.

133
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,560
It is very helpful
for the physical and mental health

134
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
of mothers.

135
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,760
- This product...
- Um...

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
This was deliberately
planned by our host.

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
As you know,

138
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,800
reverse marketing is also one
of our commonly used marketing methods.

139
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
Let me introduce you.

140
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
This is my cousin

141
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
and also a staff member in our company.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,840
Chun, go and monitor the data for us.

143
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
Okay!

144
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,440
All right.

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,690
Coming up next, we will continue
to explain another product.

146
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Before using this product,
it is recommended

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,000
to steam it for two to three minutes

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
or boil it in water
for thirty seconds to disinfect it.

149
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,790
- That's right, Dar...
- For daily use...

150
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,190
We'll pause the live stream for now.

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Dear fathers and mothers,
please have a rest.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,580
What do you think we should do, Yu Chun?

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Do you know how important
this live broadcast is to me?

154
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,360
I just want to be famous.

155
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
If I become famous,

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
wouldn't that be good for you too?

157
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
You want to be famous.

158
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Let me tell you, it won't work with me.

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Think of another plan.

160
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,190
Then I'll tell my aunt
about your fake pregnancy.

161
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Go and tell her.

162
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Quick.

163
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,560
Gu Jiahui.

164
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Send your cousin away!

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Why are you acting like a minion?

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,920
You listen to your wife in everything.

167
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm your cousin sister, after all.

168
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
If I become famous,

169
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,720
we'll share the money together.

170
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm warning you,

171
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,880
stop daydreaming.

172
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,480
Leave!

173
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,920
I don't have parents,

174
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,440
you and Jing don't want kids anyway.

175
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,320
How about treating me like your daughter

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,360
and giving me money to spend?

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Nonsense!

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Let's go!

179
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
- Come here.
- I'm not going back.

180
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,840
Let me tell you,

181
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
you'd better stay home today.

182
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't mess around with them.

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,840
Jing is pregnant.

184
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,860
Looks nice, right?

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,760
Her pregnancy

186
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,840
is fake!

187
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,620
Don't talk nonsense.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,560
I heard the fetal heartbeat.

189
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,480
Stop messing around.

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
It's a voice recorder.

191
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,960
Is it fake?
