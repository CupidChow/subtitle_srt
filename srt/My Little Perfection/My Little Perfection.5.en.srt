=My Little Perfection=
(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,120
=Episode 5=
I watched the live broadcast,

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,560
=Episode 5=
and I didn't expect such basic mistakes.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,880
It's so disappointing.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,120
Let's go find her now.

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,440
Do you know where Jing is?

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,580
I don't think
we have anything to talk about.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,440
Mr. Zhao.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,360
Let me explain.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,800
Nowadays, the most popular thing

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,640
in live broadcasting is bold innovation.

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,890
Although it may seem like
a mistake on the surface,

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,400
it's actually
intentionally designed by us.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,160
Please don't mind.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,640
Wow.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,650
So, you don't want to get pregnant

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,120
because of this man, right?

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
Mom, why are you here?

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,720
Why wouldn't I be?

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,720
If I hadn't come,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,960
I wouldn't have known
you're having an affair behind Jiahui.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
Mom, what are you talking about?

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,120
I...

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,990
- Let me tell you.
- Mom.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Yu Jing is married.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,400
Do you know?

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,790
- You're the third party!
- Mr. Zhao.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,880
- Crazy.
- Mom!

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't go!

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
- I caught you red-handed.
- Mom!

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
- Aunt, be careful.
- Come. Take a video.

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,000
- Let go!
- Come back!

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,160
Mr. Zhao.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,520
Mom!

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,800
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mom!

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,400
Enough!

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,320
It's fine
when you cause trouble at home,

38
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,760
but now I'm doing business outside.

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,150
What are you making a fuss about?

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm making a fuss?

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,560
Who's making a fuss?

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,000
Your pregnancy is fake, right?

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
The maternity school is fake, right?

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,160
The fetal heart rate monitor
is fake, right?

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,580
You don't take me seriously at all!

46
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,560
Fine.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
Since you knew it, let me tell you.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,960
I have no intention of having children,

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
not even the slightest.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,480
What you say doesn't count.

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,720
As long as I'm alive,

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,720
you won't have a say in this family.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,320
Well.

54
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,880
Let's wait and see.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,930
If she doesn't want to give birth,
then divorce.

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,360
If I can't have a grandchild

57
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,090
or reclaim the family property,

58
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,920
my life will be in vain.

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,160
Is it necessary for the sake
of the small amount?

60
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,440
Where can we find someone
as wealthy as my sister-in-law?

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Madam, Chun,

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,320
if you're free,
come to my house for a drink.

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,640
Madam,

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,320
I just want to remind you.

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,600
Jing is very career-oriented.

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,580
She doesn't plan to have children
in the next two or three years.

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
If you really want a grandchild,

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,200
you'll have to find another way.

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
Another way?

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
She's my daughter-in-law.

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,160
If she doesn't do it,

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,160
who can?

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Madam, don't be mad.

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,480
What if

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,440
she is no longer your daughter-in-law?

76
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,120
What do you mean?

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,040
There must be a way.

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
The key is

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
whether you accept it or not.

80
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
What way?

81
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Just say it directly.

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,040
Actually, since I first met Jiahui,

83
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
I've admired him a lot.

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
Whoever marries him

85
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,560
is truly lucky.

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,840
Moreover,

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,880
there's a reasonable
mother-in-law like you.

88
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,280
It's a pity

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
that Jing

90
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
doesn't appreciate this.

91
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
What exactly are you trying to say?

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
Actually, Jiahui is the kind of man

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
that makes one want to have a child

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
with him at first sight.

95
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,480
Unfortunately, he got married early.

96
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Shameless!

97
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,040
So you wanted to be a mistress.

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,960
Let me tell you.

99
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
I, Chen Guihua,

100
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
hate mistress the most in my life!

101
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Chun, let's go!

102
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay.

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,920
Here.

104
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
The last dish

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,440
is called 'Harmony'.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Mom.

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Jing.

108
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,800
There have been
many misunderstandings at home recently.

109
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,080
Here,

110
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
I offer everyone a toast.

111
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I hope you all can let things go.

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
You can't drink.

113
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
You still have to prepare for pregnancy.

114
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,800
We weren't planning
to prepare for pregnancy anyway.

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,640
Jiahui.

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,800
Drink this.

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,480
Yu Jing!

118
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm telling you,

119
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,990
now that you're part of the Gu family,

120
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,430
you have to listen to the Gu family.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,690
I'm the eldest in the Gu family.

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Let me tell you, I'm myself.

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,320
My surname is Yu, and this is my home.

124
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,630
If you want to
be the head of the family,

125
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
go back to your own home.

126
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,560
You're challenging me now!

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,320
So what?

128
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Today, I'm against everyone!

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,440
Jing, Mom.

130
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,480
You're married now.

132
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,920
You're now a member of the Gu family.

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,320
It's your duty
to have children for the Gu family.

134
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,720
My womb belongs to me.

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,200
If I want to have a child, I will.
I don't care what your surname is.

136
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,720
You...

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,600
What?

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,280
- Pointing fingers at me?
- Yes, I'm!

139
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,040
You still point?

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
You're so ill-mannered!

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
I am ill-mannered!

142
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Today, I'll teach you a lesson.

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,750
- Respect the elderly!
- Break your fingers!

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,680
Aunt!

145
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,360
- You're so ill-mannered!
- I'm not listening!

146
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,840
Enough!

147
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
- Let go of me!
- You must have children!

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,240
- Stop arguing.
- Stop arguing, Aunt.

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,560
- You're a part of the Gu family!
- I won't have any kids!

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
It's your duty to have a child!

151
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,400
Stop blocking me, I need to talk to her!

152
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,290
All right, don't mind her.

153
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,520
Darling, I'm sorry for yesterday.

154
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,920
I made a mistake and made you upset.

155
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,880
Jiahui, I'm sorry.

156
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
I made you sad yesterday.

157
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,520
- I apologize to you.
- You don't have to.

158
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,380
- Darling, have some sandwich.
- Jiahui, have some fried sticks.

159
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,890
- Sandwich is better, Darling.
- Fried sticks are better.

160
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,080
- Have some sandwich.
- Fried sticks.

161
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,640
Enough!

162
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,280
You can keep arguing.

163
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,990
It's best that you tear the roof off.

164
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't care anymore.

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,680
Jiahui!

166
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Open the window.

167
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,480
What?

168
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,990
Shan is looking for you.

169
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,920
Why did she ask you to come to me?

170
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,780
Let her come herself.

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,000
She knows you're quarreling
and feels awkward.

172
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,690
She wants you to see the contract.

173
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
Move aside. Stop being a hindrance here.

174
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,840
This is my house,
if there's any hindrance, it's you.

175
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm Jiahui's mother,

176
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,960
Jiahui's home is my home.

177
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,880
Jiahui is my husband.

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
I have the property certificate, do you?

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,960
I...

180
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,360
Hello?

181
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
Hello, Jing.

182
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,880
Come to Xiao Shan's house quickly.

183
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,280
Something happened to Jiahui.

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
- Chun!
- You're finally here!

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Where's Jiahui? What happened?

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,200
My brother used a belt
to press Shan against the door

187
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
like this.

188
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Men are not good.

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,780
Don't talk nonsense.

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Aunt!
