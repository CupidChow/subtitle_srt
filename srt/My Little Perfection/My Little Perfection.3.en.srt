(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
=Episode 3=
I recently contacted an investor.

3
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,040
She's very interested in us.

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,920
If everything goes smoothly,

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,920
we'll be able
to expand our business soon.

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,400
Xiao Shan, you're amazing.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
It's so late, and you're still working.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,480
You've worked so hard.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,920
Here.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
I made some chicken soup for you.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,200
Mom.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
This is our workplace.

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,590
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm here to apologize to Jing.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,960
Come, have some chicken soup.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,440
Mom.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
I'll drink the chicken soup

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,990
but there's no need to apologize.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,880
I've reflected on it.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,160
I've gone too far in the past few days.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,640
I formally apologize to you both.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,840
From now on,

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
you can focus on your work.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,350
I'll take care of the housework.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,320
Mom.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
It's not necessary.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,440
What about

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
having a child?

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,880
Let it happen naturally.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,440
Please keep your distance.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Beware of getting pregnant.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Mom.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,280
Beware of getting pregnant.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
Please keep your distance.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
No kissing.

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Beware of getting pregnant.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,480
No kissing.

38
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Beware of getting pregnant.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,360
Jiahui!

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
I'll sleep here tonight.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,920
Mom.

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,800
So comfortable.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,320
Gu Jiahui!

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Yu Jing! Yu...

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Mom!

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,920
You've gone too far.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
It's my fault.

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
I shouldn't have interfered.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,920
Mom.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,200
What's going on now?

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,880
Weren't you against having children?

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm afraid of you
accidentally getting pregnant.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Mom.

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,280
You don't need to apologize.

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
We should apologize to you instead.

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,120
I'm afraid
you're too young and impulsive

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
and will regret it later.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
I apologize to you both.

60
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,000
Mom.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
We should lead simple lives.

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll sleep separately
from Jiahui from now on.

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
All right?

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,160
You're still blaming me, aren't you?

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
Just forgive me!

66
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,040
Mom.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,600
Jing!

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Don't be like this.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
I should be the one apologizing to you.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm immature and disrespectful.

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
It was me being meddlesome.

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm talking nonsense.

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,280
Mom!

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm selfish.

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,880
I don't know how to respect my elders
and care for the young.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,560
Enough!

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,040
It's all my fault.

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,760
It's my fault.

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,200
All right?

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,480
All right?

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm not a good son.

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm not a good husband.

83
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,720
- Darling.
- It's all my fault.

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
It's all my fault.

85
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,040
Jiahui.

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,200
- It's not your fault.
- Stand up.

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,920
It's all my fault.

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
- Stand up first.
- It's all my fault.

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
- It's my fault.
- Jiahui.

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
- My fault!
- It's my fault.

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
It's all my fault, all right?

92
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,290
I should prepare
for pregnancy and have a child.

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,040
You said so yourself.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
I didn't force you.

95
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,680
If you want to have a child,

96
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,520
just go ahead.

97
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Are you okay?

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,880
Darling.

99
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,280
In my whole life,
I've been defeated by two women.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,920
You're one of them.

101
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Another one is Madam Chen Guihua.

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,160
May I

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
treat you to a meal?

104
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,190
I won't let her eat a single bite.

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,640
Your mother is too much.

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,600
She even curses herself with cancer.

107
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
Who knows what else she's holding back?

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,560
When did I buy the dotted design?

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,600
Aunt.

110
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,120
Let's poke some holes
so that they can get pregnant smoothly.

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Of course.

112
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,990
Let's wait for the one
that slipped through.

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
This isn't a dotted design.

114
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Obviously, it was poked.

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,080
Does this work?

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
They're genius.

117
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
Why are you still laughing?

118
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
How could you laugh?

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Why?

120
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,320
That's too much.

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,800
Hello, Miss Li.

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
I heard your partner
is planning to have a baby.

123
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
It must affect your career, right?

124
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,160
I think work
and personal life can be balanced.

125
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,420
It's best
that we communicate face-to-face.

126
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,780
Which one is the magnifying glass?

127
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
The one over there.

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
Jing, are you pregnant?

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,720
No, Mom.

130
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm going out for a bit.

131
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,460
Are you going to the hospital?

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
I'll go with you.

133
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,560
No, no.

134
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,840
Um...

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll be back soon.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Jiahui,

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
come back soon!

138
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
Your wife is pregnant!

139
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,720
Hello.

140
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
There's new information.

141
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
It seems my sister-in-law is pregnant.

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,040
Jing is back.

143
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,520
How's it going?

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,360
How's it going?

145
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
See for yourselves.

146
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Is it true?

147
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,790
Are you really pregnant?

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,360
That's great!

149
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm going to be a father!

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
However, sometimes

151
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm still quite childish.

152
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,840
No way.

153
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,190
I should be more mature

154
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,040
to take care of my big baby

155
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,040
and

156
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,760
little baby.

157
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
That's great!

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
I'm delighted!

159
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,600
Jing,

160
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,840
from now on,
you're the most important one at home.

161
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,800
Don't worry about work.

162
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Rest at home and give birth to the baby.

163
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
I'll stay at home
and do the laundry, mop the floor,

164
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
and help Jiahui wash his feet.

165
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,360
No.

166
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,840
You don't need to do these things.

167
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,040
Chun and I will take care of them.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you, Mom.

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
My waist hurts.

170
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,360
She's pregnant

171
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
and makes me so busy.

172
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,190
Why didn't I feel like this
when I was pregnant?

173
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,520
I didn't expect my shrewd aunt

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
to have such a miserable day.

175
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Chun.

176
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Since my cancer report
could be falsified,

177
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,680
could her pregnancy test report

178
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,000
be fake too?

179
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,160
It's possible.

180
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,640
I need to find a way to confirm it.

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Let her suspect.

182
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm not faking my pregnancy.

183
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,600
It's only been seven days
since your period ended.

184
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
When did you find out?

185
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
I knew it from the beginning.

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,320
The company is in a critical period now.

187
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,920
I can't stay at home
with her every day and waste time.

188
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
So, I thought

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,640
pretending to be pregnant
would calm her down for a while

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
even if it can only delay for a bit.

191
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
Then why did you lie to me too?

192
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,600
I didn't tell you

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,760
because I was afraid you wouldn't agree.

194
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
Anyway,

195
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll always stand by your side.

196
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,640
It seems Gu Jiahui's wife is pregnant.

197
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
What about Chunsheng?

198
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,800
I...

199
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
I haven't had a chance to go yet.
