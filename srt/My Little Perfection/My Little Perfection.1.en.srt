=Episode 1=

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,890
Great compassion and great mercy,
please bless me.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,990
Please grant me the fortune
of having a grandchild in three months.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,590
Great compassion and great mercy,
please bless me.

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,790
- Please grant me the fortune...
- Bad news!

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,600
You won't live long.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Listen to me.

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
Yes.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
I'll quickly go home and pack up.

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm going to my son's place

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,200
to urge them for a kid.

13
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Catch up.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Aunt, slow down.

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
We can't be slow.

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,380
I didn't agree
but you insisted on coming.

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
There's no time to waste.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
What did Mom say on the phone?

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
I guess...

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Let her be.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
I've made it clear to her.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,720
What if she insists that we have a kid?

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,680
How can that be?

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,440
We've arrived.

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Jiahui!

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,000
Jing!

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,200
Are you...

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,200
Chun.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Chun!

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
Jing!

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,880
This...

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Ouch!

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,320
Aunt.

34
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,290
What's that sound?

35
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,760
There's no sound.

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,120
No.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,480
Are you all right?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,480
Why are you inside?

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,390
I climbed in
through the window from the corridor.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Only a thief climbs through windows.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
Quick, help me up.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,880
I must come in through the front door.

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,640
Chun, turn on the lights.

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,080
Aunt, I can't find the lights.

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,960
Never mind.

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,040
Every second counts.

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,200
Grab the things.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,240
Let's go.

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,120
Darling, it seems
there really is a sound.

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll go check.

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Jing, it's us.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
It's us!

53
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,840
- Mom?
- Mom?

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
We formally inform you

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
that starting today,

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
Chun and I will be living here.

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,160
We'll leave as soon as

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
I have a grandchild.

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,240
Mom!

60
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Didn't we agree on the phone?

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,080
What are you doing?

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
By the time you two take action,
it'll be too late.

63
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Our neighbor's daughter
has had two children in three years.

64
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,160
You two have had too much free time.

65
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
It's time to focus.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,280
This is my KFC for the year.

67
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,320
If I don't accomplish it, I won't leave.

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Aunt, that's called KPI.

69
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,960
I don't care if it's K or P.

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,120
Jing,

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,120
from today onward, stop live streaming.

72
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Stay at home, learn to cook,

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,920
do housework,

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
and take care of your husband,

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,280
mother-in-law, and sister-in-law.

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,880
That's also a skill.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,240
That's right.

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,720
Mom.

79
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You're being a bit too much.

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm in a period
of career advancement now.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm already overwhelmed with work,

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,440
let alone housework and cooking.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,440
This...

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,480
Besides, whether to have a child

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,840
and when to have one

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
should be my decision.

87
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,440
That's right.

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,920
You!

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,590
A daughter-in-law like you
can't be trifled with.

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Do you want the Gu family
to have no progeny?

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,680
Aunt.

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,400
Aunt.

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Let me tell you the truth.

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,640
There's a reason we're urging you.

95
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,320
My aunt...

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,200
She... She has cancer.

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
It's lung cancer.

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,790
Let's go to the hospital.

99
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,990
She can't go to the hospital.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,000
She's afraid of going to the hospital.

101
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,920
Mom.

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
Don't worry.

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,990
We'll accompany you to the hospital.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
Let's pack up and go now.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,480
Let's go.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,240
Jiahui.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,120
Jiahui.

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
I think Mom's illness can't be delayed.

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,000
You're right.

110
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,660
Hurry up and take her to the hospital.

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,440
Jiahui!

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,800
Jing!

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,360
Don't worry about me.

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,090
We don't need to go to the hospital.

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,000
Spending at the hospital is worse

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
than saving money for my grandchild.

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,480
Mom.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,050
We can earn more money if we lose it,
but if we lose you, we lose everything.

119
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,380
You must listen to me

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,480
on this matter.

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm feeling dizzy.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,510
I'm feeling dizzy.

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
Aunt faints
at the thought of the hospital.

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,840
You're forcing her

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
to her death.

126
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
If there's no grandchild,

127
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,160
I won't go to the hospital.

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Mom.

129
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,560
As long as we prepare for pregnancy,
you'll go to the hospital, right?

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,280
Yes.

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,560
Once a promise is made,
it's hard to retract.

132
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
Chen Guihua

133
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,440
went to Jiahui's house
to urge for childbirth.

134
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,480
They've been divorced for so long,

135
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,440
yet they're still eyeing my inheritance.

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
Don't worry.

137
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,120
As long as Chunsheng gets pregnant first,

138
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,520
all my money

139
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
will be left to you.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
Got it.

141
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,760
We'll go to urge for childbirth tonight.
