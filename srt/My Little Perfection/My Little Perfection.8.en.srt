=Episode 8=
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,560
You should have let me scratch her face.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
You're so impulsive at your age.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,090
If we hadn't held you back, the passersby
would've called the police.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Bear with it.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,040
Jiahui.

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,040
It was my fault.

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,880
I really didn't know

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,080
that I was taken advantage of.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,600
I'll turn myself in.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,880
I hope you can forgive me.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Actually, I know

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
you genuinely care about Jing.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,590
It's just that you shouldn't
always think about breaking us up.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,080
No matter what happens,

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,160
I'll stand by her side.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
You don't need to apologize.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
Li Xiaolian and Gu Dequan
are a pair of venomous scorpions.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Anyone who crosses paths
with them loses out.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Aunt, please,

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
don't say so much.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,200
Come on, I haven't finished.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,200
Don't move.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,880
Be gentle.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm being very gentle, don't move.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,960
So you know you should come back.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,640
Chunsheng

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,920
let me stay at their house

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
for one more night.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,880
Really?

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,640
What happened

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,920
to your injury?

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
I was scratched by the cat downstairs

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
at Chunsheng's house.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,640
You're still lying!

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,360
Why did you go to Jiahui's house?

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,480
If someone lets me
have a grandchild first,

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,600
all my property
will be rewarded to them.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,760
Yes.

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
I'll hurry.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,320
Aunt.

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,650
Why do you still think
about how to urge them to have a kid?

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,240
No.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
I plan to bring Yujing back

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,200
and break that cunning man's plan.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,440
I brought Jing some fruits.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
- Move aside.
- Mom.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,560
You think I don't know
what you're plotting.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,320
You're trying to
drag her into this mess.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,200
No way.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,320
Mom.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,120
Jing.

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,360
Have some fruits.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,520
Are you tired?

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,160
I'll help you massage.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
Mom, what are you doing? Come out.

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,780
- I have something to say.
- Leave now.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
Jing.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm sad!

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
Jiahui's father

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
cheated during marriage.

64
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,400
He had a child with another woman

65
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,320
and took all the property
when he divorced.

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,880
He even cheated me out of my dowry.

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,040
Mom.

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,190
That's something from your generation.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
Don't involve her in it.
Sort it out yourselves.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,200
Go out.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,240
Jing.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,120
Gu Dequan is about to die.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,040
As long as we have a grandson,
we can inherit the property.

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,920
You can't just watch what belongs to us

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,360
fall into Li Xiaolian's hands.

76
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
Aunt, you're doing it again.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,260
It's none of your business.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,160
Jing, you saw that too.

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,080
Li Xiaolian has made us suffer a lot.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
Can you bear to let me go back alone

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,960
and be bullied by her?

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,780
If I can't get back the inheritance,

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
I won't rest in peace.

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
Mom, please stop.

85
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,640
Mom.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,120
You're overestimating my ability.

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
I don't have the ability
to help you reclaim the inheritance.

88
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,520
If you keep doing this,

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll have to stay in a hotel tomorrow.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,520
That's right, Aunt.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,800
We've caused them enough trouble.

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Forget it.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
Sorry for the trouble.

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,820
You don't need to stay in a hotel.

95
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
Tomorrow, I'll take Chun
back to our hometown.

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Okay.

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,800
I'll help you pack your things now.

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,520
My mother
is the most spoiled one in the family.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
She brought a lot of dowry

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,990
when she married
my financially struggling father.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,840
However,

102
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,250
during the demolition and relocation,
my father lied to her

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
and told her the divorce would be fake.

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
My father got a large sum of money.

105
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,160
When my mother
went back happily to marry him again,

106
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,850
she found out that he had been
with Li Xiaolian for a long time.

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,560
She was cheated like a fool

108
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,000
and lost her money.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,520
It's really not easy for her.

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,880
Jing.

111
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
Everyone has their own life.

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,580
You don't need to carry that burden.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Continue doing what you want to do.

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,360
The souvenirs
for the two aunts are in the trunk.

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
Mom, when you go back,
remember to send our regards.

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay.

117
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,640
You may go.

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,520
Be careful.

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,120
Go back.

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
Darling.

121
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,920
They really left.

122
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Why do I feel like I'm dreaming?

123
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,880
Darling.

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,080
You've been through a lot lately.

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,440
Thank you.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
It's nothing.

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
I should be the one thanking you.

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,080
Thank you for standing by me so firmly.

129
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,020
(Stranger: They're back)

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,120
Yu Chun.

131
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,120
Hello?

132
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,800
Jiahui!

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
Aunt is involved in an accident!

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Come back quickly!

135
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Mom had a car accident.
