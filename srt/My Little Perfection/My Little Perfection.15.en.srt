(Adapted from the novel 'Difficult Pregnancy')

=Episode 15=

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,040
Sir.

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Sir.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,960
Excuse me.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,640
Have you seen my husband today?

7
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,680
You're a pretty one,

8
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,000
but you are too vile.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,450
Can't find your husband?

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
Serves you right!

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,920
Jing?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,560
Jing?

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,040
I talked to the people.

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,880
No one has seen Jiahui.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,320
What do we do now?

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,920
Is he in trouble?

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't worry.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,040
Let's keep looking.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,920
Jiahui?

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,200
What was that for?

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,750
- What was that for?
- She is too vile.

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,180
She doesn't deserve to have a child.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,600
What was that?

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,400
Stop right there!

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Forget it, Mom.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,320
- Explain yourself!
- It's not worth it.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Forget it. Let's look for Jiahui.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
Chun, lead the way.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,030
We'll go to the police station.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
He is an adult.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
He's not missing.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Is this Gu Dequan's doing?

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,320
He wouldn't go that far.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
But Li Xiaolian would.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,240
You look exhausted.

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,560
You're recovering very well.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,200
I can sway the entire village
with just a few words.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
As long as you behave,

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,760
all of your problems

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
will be solved for you.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,280
Listen up.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
You may care about
what the villagers think,

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
but I couldn't care less.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Only the despicable

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,400
will care about having
a good reputation.

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
Our conscience is clear.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,600
Where is Jiahui?

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,400
Jiahui?

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,280
How dare you ask us?

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
He is missing.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Mom, let's go.

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,080
Jing.

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,280
Mom.

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Jing.

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
Why don't we file a police report?

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Don't worry, Mom.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Jiahui will be safe.

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,000
Wait here.

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,960
I'll be right back.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
Where are you going?

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Chun?

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
You're committing a crime.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Jiahui.

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
I know you wouldn't call the police.

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,320
Promise me.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I will let you go if you promise

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
not to tell Jing and Aunt.

68
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,880
You know I can't allow that.

69
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't get it.

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,150
Why are you betraying your own family?

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,920
You are not me.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,990
You don't understand what it's like
to be so dependent on others.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,440
Madam Lian gave me this.

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,320
She said

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
I'd get a share as long as

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,400
she got the family wealth.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
My mom sees you as her own.

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,640
She has never mistreated you.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
Why would you need the money?

80
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
Sees me as her own?

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
You only need

82
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
to give a dog some food
and water for it to live.

83
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
She has never cared about me.

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
I grew up an orphan.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
I never blame anyone for my fate.

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
But no one ever cared about me.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,920
Jiahui.

88
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,520
Promise me.

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
If I get the money,

90
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,720
you will get your cut.

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,520
We will always be a family.

92
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,440
Open your eyes.

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
How naive of you.

94
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
Chun.

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,160
He is your big brother.

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,120
How could you do this to him?

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,880
Brother?

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
More like a cousin.

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,120
Listen to yourself!

100
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,360
Your aunt would be
heartbroken to hear that.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
My aunt?

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
She doesn't even care about her own son.

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,280
Why would she care about me?

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
I grew up with my parents.

105
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,960
People said all sorts of
awful things to me.

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
Did she show any concern?

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
Did you?

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,560
I only want to have a home.

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
But you shouldn't have
trusted Li Xiaolian.

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Look at what you did to Jiahui.

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't you have a heart?

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,680
Trust me, she won't give you
even a penny.

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Stop daydreaming.

114
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,920
But I...

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,480
But only she knows

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,320
I love strawberry cakes.

117
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,420
She knows I'm afraid of cockroaches.

118
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,880
She was there to defend me when people
made fun of me for being an orphan.

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
She said

120
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
since she didn't have a daughter,

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,480
I was like a daughter to her.

122
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Chun.

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't be silly.

124
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
You can't trust her.

125
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,840
You can be your bottom dollar

126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
it was all just acting.

127
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
Hello? Chun?

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
What's wrong?

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Madam Lian.

130
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,520
Come to Jiahui's place.

131
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
He's in trouble.

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
Madam Lian!

133
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,080
Jiahui isn't breathing.

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,280
I have nothing to do with this.

135
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,000
It's you!

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,840
You tricked him...

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,280
You abducted him.

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,880
You...
