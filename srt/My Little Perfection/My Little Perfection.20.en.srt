=Episode 20=

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
Scoundrel! Come back here!

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,680
Stop running!

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,640
- Watch it!
- Come back here!

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,640
- Calm down.
- Listen up.

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,350
You don't care about me
now that you're married!

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
- I shouldn't have raised you!
- Mom!

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,630
Stop hitting me!

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,680
I'll kill you!

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,600
You are embarrassing yourself.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm going to end you!

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,040
- The wealth Gu Dequan gave you...
- Mom!

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,640
Put that down!

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,040
- You have to give it back!
- Put that down!

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,280
You...

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,290
You are embarrassing yourself!

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,480
- Listen up!
- Jiahui! Run!

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,080
- Stop!
- Worthless child!

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,280
- This has gone far enough!
- Aunt!

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,990
- I am going to...
- Aunt!

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,580
- Get it away from her!
- Gu Dequan gave you everything!

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
I deserve to have my share!

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,760
Listen up.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,120
That is my dowry!

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,240
- Mom.
- Give them back!

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,240
This is enough.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,840
- I deserve half of it.
- Mom.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,320
Mom.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,040
Stop fighting.

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,920
How could you?

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,580
You don't care
about your mother anymore!

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,080
- Jiahui, run!
- Today,

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
I'll teach you a lesson!

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,760
What did I do wrong?

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,280
Mom!

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Come back here!

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,240
No!

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,990
- Come back here!
- No!

40
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,290
- What are you looking at?
- Mom!

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,480
Why didn't you come home sooner?

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,240
You left the chores undone.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,840
Are you really going
to stand against me?

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,780
What are you staring at?

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm not dead yet.

46
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,760
If you want my money,

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,520
you should be nice to me.

48
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,880
Don't bring that up again.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,440
You said whoever gave birth
to a child would get the money.

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Yu Jing is not pregnant yet,

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,890
but you gave your money to Gu Jiahui.

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,200
What about me and Chunsheng?

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
I've served you for half my life.

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
But you chose the son
of your ex-wife over me?

55
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,480
Where did you learn this?

56
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,680
I never promised them a penny.

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,040
Anyone here?

58
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,040
What are you doing here?

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Dad.

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
Jiahui and I

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,040
thought it through.

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,160
We didn't carry out our duty
as your son and daughter.

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
We came to apologize.

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Dad, sorry.

65
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,860
I hope you can look past our mistakes.

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,160
I promise

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,320
Jiahui and I will do our best

68
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,080
to make it up to you.

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
We will take great care of you.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,280
Throw these away!

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Leave! Go away!

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
We don't need your stupid gifts!

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Sorry.

74
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Please forgive us.

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,360
Well...

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,480
Dad.

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
Calm down.

78
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
We'll head back now.

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Off you go.

80
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
Go away!

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,880
Stop denying it.

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
They are sending you gifts.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
You took all the money
from our live streams.

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,360
You give me false promises.

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,040
And now you gave them everything.

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
Gu Dequan, listen up!

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,920
I don't care if you live or die!

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
You are on your own!

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Xiao...

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,080
Xiaolian.

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,920
Xiaolian.

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,240
Xiaolian.

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,240
Have you seen my son and his wife?

94
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,560
What?

95
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,720
Came to gloat?

96
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
What do you mean?

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Think about it.

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,160
If Jiahui inherits everything,

99
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Jing will get it eventually.

100
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,200
How cunning.

101
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,320
It's a shame you're a woman.

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,160
Do not underestimate women.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
Especially the rebellious kind.

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't believe

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,250
Jiahui married a wife like you.

106
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
He's not like you.

107
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
Heed my advice.

108
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,720
Give Chen Guihua
what is rightfully hers.

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,080
Otherwise, things will get ugly for you.

110
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
As you know,

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
part of the family's wealth is my dowry.

112
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
After all that I've done,

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,280
I didn't get anything.

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,440
Your dowry?

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
I served him for half of my life.

116
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,280
He is always so stingy.

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,520
He abused Chunsheng and me.

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,920
I deserve the money.

119
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
You can't say that.

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,560
You two made a lot of money
selling produce on live streams.

121
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
What money?

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
The money goes to him.

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
You gave him all the money?

124
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,560
But...

125
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
You should keep the money to yourself.

126
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,160
You know

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
how stingy he is.

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,980
He won't give a penny.

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
You've served him for nothing.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,680
What else can I do?

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,840
I'm old and trapped in this sickness.

132
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,520
Otherwise, all of you
would be no match for me,

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
even if you worked together.

134
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,120
Before I die,

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,200
unless I see my grandchild,

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
I'll burn everything to the ground.

137
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,240
None of you will get anything from me.

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,360
And no one will show up at your funeral.

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,200
I've lived a long life.

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,320
I've seen my fair share of the world.

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Bring it on.

142
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,680
We'll see about that.

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,480
By the way,

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
a fair warning.

145
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,360
I will upload evidence
of your crimes and sins to the internet.

146
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,120
Including how you make money
with your fake backstory.
