=Episode 13=

3
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,040
Chun?

4
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
Young man.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
Be cautious.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,200
The solidarity star is born.

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,400
Calamity will befall us.

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
Please protect us.

9
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,040
Please protect us

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
from any forms of harm.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
- Aunt!
- Please protect us.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,120
- Bad news!
- Why you... You scared me.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
What is it now?

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Last night,

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
every bedroom in Gu Dequan's home

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
was haunted again.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,640
There are bloody palm prints everywhere.

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,840
Aunt.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
If you can't bring yourself to do it,

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know someone who can chase her away.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
Leave!

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Cursed jinx.

23
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Back to your city!

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,480
You are not welcome here!

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,760
Mom.

26
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,580
Is that what you think as well?

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,390
She carries the ill fate
of the solidarity star.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
She is a bad omen

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
to the elders and herself.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,040
Send her back to where she came from.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,320
I...

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,200
It's not up to me to decide.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,320
But Jing...

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Well...

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
It's better to believe
than to disbelieve.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Well...

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,080
Everyone says you can't bear a child,

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,600
and that you bring
ill fortune to the whole family.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,640
Yeah!

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Leave now!

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,920
Leave.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Do you think baseless rumors
can chase me away and stop me

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,040
from becoming a mother?

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
You're getting ahead of yourself.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Listen closely.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,440
I decided to stay.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
There's no way I'm leaving.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,360
Fine.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Don't hurt her!

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm warning you.

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
You must leave today!

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,590
I don't care what excuses you have!

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,520
Lian, Aunt!

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,500
- I'm going nowhere!
- Calm down.

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,280
Calm down.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,040
- Mom.
- Aunt.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,890
Do you know why Li Xiaolian
doesn't want me to have a child?

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,640
If I ever have a child,

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,240
she won't inherit a thing.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:43,990
Why you...

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,760
Slandering won't work on us.

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,500
As long as she's here,

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,080
we won't live to spend

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
a penny of the will!

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,720
I'd love to see what you can do to me

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,760
if I refuse

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
to leave this home.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
You asked for this.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,750
See for yourselves.

70
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
My goodness, Lian.

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,400
You were behind this!

72
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Listen up.

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Lin Cuihua has been criticized

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,980
by the authority for spreading
superstitious beliefs.

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,520
What?

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
The fortune teller got arrested?

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,960
The solidarity star is born.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,320
Calamity will befall us.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,520
Is that so?

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,920
Hold on.

81
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,120
I can see it now.

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
You've been a fraud.

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,360
You will be sent to jail today.

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Lin Cuihua.

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,600
We received reports
you're spreading superstitious beliefs.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Come with us.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,490
Blame yourselves for being so foolish.

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,960
Lian!

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,800
You alienated me and my daughter-in-law!

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
- I'll make you pay!
- Let go of me!

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,560
- Aunt!
- Mom!

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
You are no better.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,360
You kicked me out
without telling Gu Dequan.

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm not afraid.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,240
I am the owner of this house.

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,280
I can decide whether or not
you should be kicked out.

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,040
The owner?

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
You're just a babysitter.

99
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,440
Why you...

100
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,640
Listen up.

101
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
He wants to make me pay,

102
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,360
not you.

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Relay a message for me.

104
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
I will never

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,640
have a child.

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,760
But whatever you took from my mother,

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
you must give them back.

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Fat chance!

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,680
Is that all you can do?

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
I can

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
take it from here.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,240
Keep an eye on Chunsheng.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,080
I want him to give me

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,320
a satisfying answer within three months.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Mom.

116
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,160
The doctor said

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
I'd never

118
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,160
have a child in this life.

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,360
Fine.

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
I will arrange it.

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
How is the investigation?

122
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,000
There's another matter.

123
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,920
I suspect Chun and Li Xiaolian

124
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
are working together.

125
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,400
(Did you see it?)

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,040
(Yeah.)

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,720
(I saw Chun taking the ghost doll
Li Xiaolian dropped.)

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,360
I see.

129
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
Chun lives with Mom.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
It's easy to use a haunting as a ruse.

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,920
Do not tell her about this.

132
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
I'll test her reactions.

133
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Sure.

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
Now you know

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,920
how intelligent

136
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,920
your husband is.

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,560
Bring your intelligent mind here.

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,680
It's pretty smart.

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,520
I can feel it.
