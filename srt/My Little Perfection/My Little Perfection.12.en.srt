=Episode 12=

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,960
Who's there?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Chun.

5
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,800
This kid.

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,960
Chun!

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,480
This kid.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,960
Why did she lock herself outside?

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,840
Aunt!

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
Chun.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Is that you, Chun?

12
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,960
Aunt!

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
Chun, what's wrong?

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,160
I just went out to drink some water,

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,760
and I felt like
someone was chasing me from behind.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm so scared.

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,560
Don't be afraid.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm here.

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
Aunt.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,280
What should we do now?

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,440
Have there been
any new faces around here recently?

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
My daughter-in-law is here

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,380
and will stay for two days.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
That's right.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,760
She's carrying a solitary star,

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
which means she's fated

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
to give a hard time
for the elderly and herself.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Let her go back to where she came from.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,720
Go back?

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,000
No way.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
What will I do if she leaves?

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
If you hesitate again,

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
one of you

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,000
will suffer

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,560
a disaster.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Here.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,200
Take this.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,000
Put it under your pillow.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
It will protect you in critical moments

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
and ensure your safety.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,960
Thank you.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,080
Thanks to you,

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
we managed to sell so many cherries

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,800
all at once.

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,360
You're welcome.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,880
I'll definitely
help my fellow villagers.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,960
Don't worry.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
The buyer I found

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
will offer the highest price.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
Yes.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,800
You're busy.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
We shall leave.

54
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,580
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Gu.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Goodbye.

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,040
Hello, Shan.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
I remember you have a friend
who is a fruit vendor.

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,240
Can you inquire

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
about this year's cherry market?

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,080
Mom.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,920
Why were you so flustered
early in the morning?

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll tell you later.

63
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
They are so strange.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Aunt, look.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,080
Aunt.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
The solitary star mole is true.

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,920
The next one is the disaster.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,800
The fortune teller said
that your zodiac signs don't match.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,360
The next unlucky one
will definitely be you.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,680
What should I do?

71
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,340
Didn't the fortune teller
give you a lot of things?

72
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,190
Let me get them for you.

73
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, yes.

74
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,440
Hurry up, give them to me.

75
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520
Blessings from the gods.

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,200
Here's more.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,890
Blessings from the gods.

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,760
This is the most important one.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,890
- The most important one.
- Where should I put it?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,390
The fortune teller said
it must be placed under the pillow.

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Okay.

82
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,690
Aunt, should we still
urge them to have a baby?

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,690
What's the point of having a baby
when we can't even save our lives?

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,160
Be careful, Aunt!

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,690
- You're so ominous.
- Mom, what happened?

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,280
Are you okay?

87
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,240
Does it hurt?

88
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,900
Don't come here.

89
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm okay.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm just afraid
you got hurt from the fall.

91
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,360
The floor is cold.

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
We like lying on the floor.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,330
- Yes.
- Don't come here.

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,560
No, it's okay.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
The bed is too soft.

96
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
My back hurts.

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,360
Then...

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,480
Um...

99
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,320
I...

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,160
I'll leave.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Go ahead.

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Do you mean that this year's
cherry market is in short supply?

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
The unified purchase price is not low.

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,240
Okay.

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,560
I got it.

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
What did you say just now?

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Darling.

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Just now, I...

109
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
What's wrong, Darling?

110
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,280
Chun and Mom look at me
like they've seen a ghost.

111
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
How is that possible?

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
I've never seen such a beautiful ghost.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Stop trying to mesmerize me.

115
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,000
Why don't you

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
go and gather some information for me?

117
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,120
Okay.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Since my wife has spoken,
how can I not go?

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,660
Let me go and see. You go to bed first.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,700
Don't wait for me.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
Jiahui.

122
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,080
Why don't you and Jing
go back to the city first?

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,430
- Mom.
- The fortune teller told us.

124
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,120
Jing has a solitary star fate.

125
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,360
If she stays here,

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,840
we'll die.

127
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,920
You must believe it.

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,680
The fortune teller said
I'll have a disaster today.

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,730
Let me tell you,

130
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,320
the photo frame
suddenly fell down just now.

131
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
I was right under it.

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
If Chun hadn't pulled me out,

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,840
I wouldn't have seen you today.

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,880
Photo frame?

135
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,200
(All four screws
fell out at the same time.)

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,080
(This is obviously intentional.)
