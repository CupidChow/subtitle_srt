=Episode 16=

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:52,840
You...

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,240
You set me up!

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,240
Li Xiaolian.

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,000
You are involved in an abduction.

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
If I call the police,

8
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
you won't get away with this.

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,040
No.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,920
It was her.

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,560
She knew Chen Guihua was superstitious.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,200
So,

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,680
she used the haunting to scare her!

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,520
It was her idea

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,560
to abduct Jiahui.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,760
Lies!

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,760
You knocked Jiahui out cold.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,840
You've been lying to me the whole time.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
No!

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,120
Li Xiaolian.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
You were the one who hit me.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,480
Don't put the blame on Chun.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,880
Li Xiaolian.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,200
You have two options.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,120
One,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,680
turn yourself in.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,760
We will plead with the authority

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,320
to give you a lighter sentence.

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
But I...

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,280
Two,

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,790
we call the police.

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,360
You'll be in jail for years.

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,920
I have faith in the law.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,200
Should we tell Mom

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,840
about Yu Chun?

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,520
Let's not.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
It would've broken her heart.

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Where were you?

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,040
Your brother is still missing.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
What do we do now?

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
He's right behind me.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,440
Behind you?

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,600
My son!

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,000
You're finally back!

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Where have you been? Are you hurt?

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm all right, Mom.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,840
See? I am perfectly fine.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,150
- I am all right.
- Yes, Mom.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
We just got home.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
Let Jiahui take a shower.

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,040
All is well.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,480
You're turning yourself in?

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
What happened?

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,440
I...

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
They uncovered my plan.

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,800
If I don't turn myself in,

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
they will call the police.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Please.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
Let them leave.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
I want to know

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,960
what leverage they have on you.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,240
Gu...

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Gu Jiahui was

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,480
abducted by me.

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,490
They are having a fight upstairs.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
A man is hitting a woman
in this day and age?

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,400
What is it?

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,360
Go away!

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,640
You can move back to your home.

71
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Are you all right?

72
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,640
We didn't think he'd...

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,120
I have some medicine in my room.

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
Let me get it for you.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't need your sympathy.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Leave now.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
I'll start packing.

78
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
Here, Mom.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,840
We're finally back on our turf!

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,400
- Wonderful!
- Here.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,040
I can carry it.

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,600
Jing.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,640
Impressive.

84
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
What did you say to her?

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
Why did she return the house?

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,400
She...

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,200
She...

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
It's because

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,520
they are worried we might get
too friendly with Gu Dequan.

90
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,200
Are you keeping secrets from me?

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,320
Where have you been all day?

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
Mom, I'm so itchy.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,120
It's the mosquitoes.

95
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,240
Can you get me some clothes
so I can get changed?

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,190
I want to take a shower.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,960
Can my clothes even fit?

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
Of course.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
I like wearing your clothes.

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,290
I'll get you the clothes.

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Let's go.

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,720
Where are you from, beauty?

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,200
Speak of yourself.

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
This is your fault.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
You made Mom and me worry.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
I'm all right now.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
It's over.

108
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
So,

109
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
let me join the village group.

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,840
What for?

111
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,360
Do you really want to
be the village beauty?

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Don't be silly.

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,400
Hi.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Nice to see you guys.

115
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Hello, everybody.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
All the soon-to-be mothers,

117
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,680
while you're pregnant,

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,600
remember to get
enough iron for your body.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,960
We ship our cherries
straight from the farm.

120
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,640
See?

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,400
There is a plantation right behind us.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
Let me try one for you.

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
See? This is a fresh cherry.

124
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
Freshly picked.

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Let me try another.

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
It's so sweet!

127
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,520
It's bursting with juice!

128
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,280
A lot of money.

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Our hard-earned money...

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
This is evil.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,760
That's a lot.

132
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
See? He's earned a fortune.

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Let's go.

134
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,000
Gu Dequan! Stop right there!

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
What are you doing? He is a patient!

136
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,720
He is a fraud!

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
See this? He is a fraud!

138
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
We saw the video.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,760
- You took our money!
- What do you want?

140
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,320
- He is still a patient!
- We suffered because of you!

141
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,680
Old man?

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,460
What's wrong?

143
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,160
Old man?

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,000
What's wrong?

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,640
Old man, you're scaring me!

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Stop scaring me!
