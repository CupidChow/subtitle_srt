1
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:46,025
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
I'll save you.

3
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,825
When the time comes,
whether you want it or not,

4
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,580
you need to come with me.

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,680
I might die there.

6
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Huai'en.

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
This is also a type of liking someone.

8
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,380
Where's my brother Xiaobao?

9
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,220
Brother.

10
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,171
Xiaoyu.

11
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,046
Xiaoyu.

12
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,884
Brother.

13
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,780
Xiaoyu.

14
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Young Master.

15
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,668
Brother.

16
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:58,893
Xiaoyu.

17
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,575
Let me look at you.

18
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,820
You look taller.

19
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,620
Right?

20
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,180
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,820
Did Huai'en bring you back?

22
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,860
Why is there blood on you?

23
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,100
Are you injured?

24
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,740
I-I'm not injured.

25
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,540
Then, why is there blood on you?

26
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,150
Xiaobao.

27
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,190
I think I heard Xiaoyu's voice.

28
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,175
Xiaoyu.

29
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,010
Mom.

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,500
Xiaoyu.

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,425
Come here.

32
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,745
Let me look at you.

33
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,900
Let me look at you.

34
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,230
Why didn't Huai'en come back with you?

35
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:41,660
He…

36
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,500
is gone.

37
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
He's gone?

38
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,540
Does he have something to do?

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,460
No.

40
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,823
He's royalty

41
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:49,900
and distinguished.

42
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,020
He went where he belongs.

43
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,620
No way.

44
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,860
Believe it or not.

45
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,525
Su Yin, you're lying to me, aren't you?

46
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,780
We grew up together.

47
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
I know when you're lying.

48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,180
Where is he?

49
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,659
What's wrong with him?

50
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,020
I told you

51
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,740
he was gone.

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,700
Su Yin, what happened to him?

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,140
Will you tell me the truth?

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,060
Tell me.

55
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,460
Since you want to know it,

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,780
I'll tell you.

57
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,020
He's dead.

58
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:23,817
No way.

59
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,180
You can ask Xiaoyu.

60
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,258
Xiaoyu.

61
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:38,518
It's not true.

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,140
Young Master.

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,620
Young Master.

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,300
It's not true.

65
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,672
He said

66
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,060
he would come back.

67
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,870
It's you.

68
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,070
You took the jade pendant he gave me, right?

69
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,942
What did you do to him?

70
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,310
He's dead.

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,670
I gave your jade pendant back to him.

72
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,550
It's not true.

73
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,990
It's not true.

74
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,270
He's really dead.

75
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,532
Even if he's dead, I want to see his body.

76
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:11,670
Where is he?

77
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,550
Jin Xiaobao.

78
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,630
He deliberately approached
and lied to you.

79
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,310
He destroyed your family

80
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,350
and got you poisoned.

81
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,599
He ruined your life,
and ruined everything for you.

82
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,745
Why do you have to pester him?

83
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,790
Jin Xiaobao.

84
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,550
You're self-contemptuous.

85
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,110
No way.

86
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,030
That's not true.

87
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:47,976
Huai'en.

88
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,896
He's still alive, isn't he?

89
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,445
Su Yin.

90
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:57,498
I know.

91
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,811
I'm sorry for you.

92
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,596
I always let you down.

93
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,745
You have suffered so much for me.

94
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:11,169
I'll never be able to pay you back.

95
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,009
If you want to kill me,

96
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,169
that's fine.

97
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,882
Please let him go, okay?

98
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,710
He has suffered enough over the years.

99
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,710
I promise you.

100
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,630
As long as you let him go,

101
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,150
I'm always at your disposal.

102
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,710
I'll never be with him again.

103
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,110
I'll do anything you say.

104
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,150
I'll do anything you say.

105
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,150
I'll have a wife and children.

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,670
I'll never see him again.

107
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,710
As long as you let him go.

108
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,383
Please, Su Yin.

109
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,959
Your Highness.

110
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,467
Your Highness.

111
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,217
Please don't make him feel embarrassed.

112
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,350
If you want to cure Jin Xiaobao,

113
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,670
you can't just use crimson dahlias.

114
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,950
We also need two people
with strong internal forces

115
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,750
to protect his heart meridian.

116
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,323
Otherwise, he could die at any moment.

117
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:03,246
It's hard to make it on your own.

118
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,790
Su Yin.

119
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,268
Su Yin, I'm begging you.

120
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:11,910
- Xiaobao.
- Su Yin, please.

121
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,670
- Young Master.
- Xiaobao.

122
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,270
Su Yin.

123
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,070
- Young Master.
- Xiaobao.

124
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,870
- Xiaobao.
- Don't do this.

125
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,710
He's alive. We still have a chance to save him.

126
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,950
Really? Let's go.

127
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,276
Really. Let's go.

128
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,550
Su Yin.

129
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,910
Zhaocai, Jinbao.

130
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,404
Take people to look for him.

131
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,044
Yes.

132
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:38,819
Be careful.

133
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,430
Huai'en.

134
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,490
You're awake.

135
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,950
Great.

136
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,656
I thought we couldn't save you.

137
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,590
Xiaobao.

138
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm here.

139
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm here.

140
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,243
I'm here.

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,070
Do you feel better?

142
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,990
You can't eat right now.

143
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,110
I asked someone to cook some porridge.

144
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,350
You can eat it later.

145
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,276
Take a rest first.

146
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,910
You are so sweet.

147
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,190
Put him down.

148
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,150
Put him down.

149
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,630
Let him examine you first.

150
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,710
Just lie down.

151
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,030
Easy on him.

152
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,830
Do you want to do it?

153
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,758
Jinbao.

154
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,250
Where is Su Yin?

155
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,470
Jin Xiaobao.

156
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,790
You grew a conscience?

157
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,910
You can still think of Su Yin.

158
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,150
You'd better worry about your life.

159
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,009
The weather official has figured out the time.

160
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,545
I'll treat you

161
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,465
in six days.

162
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:05,745
Whether you survive or not

163
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,480
depends on that.

164
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,110
Get ready.

165
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,910
Which one of you will do it first?

166
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,990
- Me.
- Me.

167
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,150
Why do you have to do it first?

168
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,590
Why do you have to do it first?

169
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,030
You go out and fight.

170
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,630
The one who's not dead is staying.

171
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,150
Don't blame me

172
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,990
if we miss the right time.

173
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,010
You do it first.

174
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,030
Why don't you go back now?

175
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,520
No, I want to be with you.

176
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,390
Can you suffer the pain for my young master?

177
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,790
Just go back.

178
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,950
You're an eyesore here.

179
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,890
Eat this.

180
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,290
Young Master.

181
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,550
Too much of this pill will make you silly.

182
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,070
But it's okay to eat less.

183
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,212
It won't hurt anymore after you eat it.

184
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:38,350
If it hurts,

185
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,736
you have to bear with it.

186
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:42,110
If you mess up and twist the needle,

187
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,150
you will suffer.

188
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,030
Don't sleep.

189
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,670
If you fall asleep, you will be boiled.

190
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,961
Tell me if it hurts.

191
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,081
Don't fall asleep.

192
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,190
Are your injuries getting better?

193
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,950
I'm all right.

194
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,390
Don't worry about me.

195
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,116
Am I invisible?

196
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,830
Oh, Jin Xiaobao.

197
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,750
I remember you promised me

198
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,990
you'd cut him off

199
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,270
as long as I let him go.

200
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,077
And you said you would have a big family

201
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:22,203
and live a happy life.

202
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,990
Well…

203
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,030
That's a band-aid solution.

204
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,110
Good for you.

205
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,430
You know band-aid solution.

206
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,190
Don't you insult him.

207
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:37,830
Jin Xiaobao.

208
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,270
You'd better wait to die.

209
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,112
Hang in there.

210
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:19,336
Xiaobao.

211
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:20,866
Hang in there.

212
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,550
Hang in there, Xiaobao.

213
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,350
Hang in there.

214
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,970
Hang in there.

215
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,250
It's okay.

216
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:38,859
Needle.

217
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,632
Xiaobao, hold on. Don't fall asleep.

218
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,450
Young Master, are you okay?

219
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,450
Wipe off my sweat.

220
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,930
Young Master, hold on. Don't fall asleep.

221
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,110
Don't think you can wipe out the Tong Sect
by arresting me.

222
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,790
I've worked hard for more than 20 years.

223
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:01,931
Even if I die,

224
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,310
my followers won't stop.

225
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,324
Zongzheng Yunlian

226
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,582
will not be in peace as emperor.

227
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,796
I'm not here

228
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,790
to hear you say that.

229
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,630
I want to talk to you

230
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,230
about Huai'en.

231
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,990
There's nothing for us to talk about.

232
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:33,484
Do you remember?

233
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,030
Tongen lost her mother from childhood.

234
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,710
Her father, Xue Wei,
had many wives and concubines.

235
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,470
He barely cared about her.

236
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:43,950
Tongen suffered a lot

237
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,830
as a child.

238
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,070
But she was kind.

239
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,510
She loved children.

240
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,310
She said if she had a child,

241
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,683
she would

242
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:00,443
keep him safe all her life

243
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,750
so he can do whatever he wants.

244
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,670
I told you.

245
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,230
There's nothing to talk about.

246
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,028
But you deprived her of her rights.

247
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,990
You made her child

248
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,990
lose his mother at birth.

249
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,590
Not only that,

250
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,430
but you tortured him,

251
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,230
twisted his mind,

252
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,847
deprived him

253
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,127
of the pleasures of the world.

254
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,510
He is Zongzheng Yunlian's son, not mine.

255
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,710
But you named him Huai'en.

256
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,550
He's Tongen's son.

257
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,070
Tongen was his image.

258
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:42,568
How could you

259
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,150
treat him meanly?

260
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,350
Why?

261
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,950
How dare you?

262
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,270
How dare you say you didn't like Tongen?

263
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,470
I'm not you.

264
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,590
To me,

265
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,170
Tongen was like my sister.

266
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,670
You said you would live for Tongen.

267
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:16,430
But

268
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,990
these are Tongen favorite foods.

269
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,395
What did you do?

270
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,835
You never looked at them.

271
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:33,493
Tongen.

272
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,110
Tongen.

273
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,870
No.

274
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:41,798
It's not my fault.

275
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,070
It's their fault.

276
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,350
They wanted to tear us apart.

277
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,390
I wanted to love Huai'en.

278
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,150
He's Tongen's son.

279
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,990
How could I not love him?

280
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,830
But…

281
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,430
But he's also Zongzheng Yunlian's son.

282
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,360
I hate him.

283
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,412
I hate him.

284
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:12,693
No.

285
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,133
You don't love anyone.

286
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,430
You only love yourself.

287
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,550
No.

288
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,790
No.

289
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,110
Get Huai'en to see me.

290
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,991
Get Huai'en to see me.

291
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:25,951
I promise you.

292
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,270
Get Huai'en to see me.

293
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,230
I'll order the Tong Sect

294
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,510
to cease their rebellion.

295
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,550
That way,

296
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,910
I can die in peace.

297
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,310
Tongen.

298
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,990
We'll meet soon.

299
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,350
He won't confess until he sees Huai'en?

300
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,197
Why?

301
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,077
I don't know.

302
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:30,710
You don't know?

303
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,485
You knew it.

304
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:35,070
And you knew Huai'en was my son.

305
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,390
I didn't know.

306
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,470
I just believed in Tongen.

307
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,710
Are you blaming me?

308
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,950
I don't dare.

309
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,616
Nonsense. You're blaming me.

310
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,310
You've probably cursed me in your mind.

311
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,030
I don't blame you.

312
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,790
I don't want to justify myself.

313
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,910
How is it going with the Tong Sect?

314
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,678
Everything has been deployed.

315
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:14,278
But

316
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,950
Zongzheng Yuzhan wanted Huai'en to meet him.

317
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,590
If Huai'en meets him,

318
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,670
maybe we can wipe out the Tong Sect

319
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,110
without fighting.

320
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,230
Are you going there

321
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,190
to stand up for Huai'en,

322
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,790
or do you want to use his guilt over Huai'en

323
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,110
to make him give in?

324
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,310
Leave it up to Huai'en.

325
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes.

326
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,896
Excuse me.

327
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,570
Tongen.

328
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,870
It's done.

329
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:58,430
Great.

330
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,070
Thank you, Miracle Doctor.

331
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,110
No need to thank me.

332
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,135
I'll take Jinbao with me.

333
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:08,830
We'll leave tomorrow.

334
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,150
Tomorrow?

335
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,710
Where are you going?

336
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,030
It has nothing to do with you.

337
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,550
Young Master, wherever we go,

338
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,750
I'll come back.

339
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,870
Don't worry.
We need to deliver medicine to you.

340
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,470
Let's go.

341
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,070
Young Master. Zhaocai.

342
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,498
I'll miss you.

343
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,470
Zhaocai.

344
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,590
Help me get back to rest.

345
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:32,660
Su Yin.

346
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,670
Su Yin, are you still mad at me?

347
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,270
What?

348
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,941
Who am I to be mad at you?

349
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,630
It's great.

350
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,350
It's great.

351
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,950
Remember,

352
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,550
don't lie to me again.

353
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,535
I'll never lie to you again.

354
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,310
By the way,

355
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,670
how is your bad dad?

356
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,510
He was thrown into prison.

357
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,070
I think

358
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,270
he'll be beheaded soon.

359
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,768
Then…

360
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:14,865
Would you miss him?

361
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:15,865
Of course not.

362
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,790
If it weren't for him,

363
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,790
our family wouldn't be where it is today.

364
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,670
If it weren't for him,

365
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,310
maybe your mother would still be alive.

366
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:29,471
I'll be with you from now on.

367
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,710
Okay?

368
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,230
Brother.

369
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,830
Brother. You're finally healed.

370
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,150
Yeah.
I'm healed.

371
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,276
I missed you.

372
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:48,983
I missed you too.

373
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,870
Young Master.

374
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,750
Jinbao.

375
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,190
You must eat well

376
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,470
without me around.

377
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,270
Jinbao.

378
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:08,974
Take good care of yourself.

379
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,781
You too, Zhaocai.

380
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,110
Jinbao.

381
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,710
Jinbao.

382
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,303
Young Master.

383
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,470
I'll miss you.

384
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,470
Young Master.

385
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,470
Take care of yourself.

386
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,670
Huai'en, don't bully our young master.

387
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,430
I can't stand it.

388
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:28,223
Young Master.

389
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:29,723
Young Master.

390
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:31,408
I can't bear to part with you.

391
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:32,030
Jinbao.

392
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,823
Young Master,
remember to take your medicine on time.

393
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:34,404
Zhaocai.

394
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:36,204
Don't let Huai'en bully our young master.

395
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,016
Jinbao.

396
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:38,710
Young Master.

397
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,936
- Jinbao.
- Young Master.

398
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:41,711
Young Master.

399
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,750
Young Master.

400
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,796
Go.

401
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,540
I'll come back to see you often.

402
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,176
Jinbao.

403
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,130
Young Master.

404
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,743
Go.

405
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:49,522
Jinbao.

406
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,550
Why are you sighing?

407
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:40,987
I don't know how to make you happy.

408
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,870
You want to make me happy?

409
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,350
Don't you hate me

410
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,870
for almost killing the person
you love the most?

411
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,969
I don't hate you

412
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:54,070
even if you kill both of us.

413
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,110
I owe you so much.

414
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,790
All right.

415
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,750
Cut the nonsense.

416
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:05,710
I know.

417
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,270
You are doing this for my own good.

418
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,203
You wanted to get me back on track.

419
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:13,750
So I can have a wife and children

420
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,230
instead of hanging out with a man.

421
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,950
So what?

422
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,950
You're still

423
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,790
hanging out with him.

424
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,421
Come on, Su Yin.

425
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,070
Since we met,

426
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,750
he has made mistakes,

427
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,318
and so have I.

428
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,830
Anyway, we are stuck together

429
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,790
and can't be separated.

430
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,550
My parents

431
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,470
are disillusioned with the world.

432
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,350
They are going to practice Buddhism.

433
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,710
When my family was powerful
and rich

434
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,270
in Jiangnan,

435
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,670
no serious girls liked me.

436
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,990
Now my family is poor.

437
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,550
Who would want to marry me?

438
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,990
Besides, the miracle doctor said

439
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:04,150
that I couldn't stop taking medication

440
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,150
for the rest of my life.

441
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,630
With my physical condition,

442
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,350
I'd better not hurt others.

443
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,135
I'll just be with Huai'en.

444
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:11,990
Don't worry.

445
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,870
I'm not going to make it easy for him

446
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,310
after he's with me.

447
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,510
Su Yin,

448
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,010
you've been worrying so much
about me for the past year.

449
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,550
You're getting old.

450
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,790
You're getting old.

451
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,550
Su Yin,

452
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,031
I meant what I said.

453
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:42,797
You are so kind to me.

454
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,917
I can't repay you.

455
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,110
Except for Huai'en's matter,

456
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,212
I'm willing to do

457
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:52,470
whatever you ask.

458
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,516
I'm even willing to die for you.

459
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,840
Ouch.

460
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,950
I went to a lot of trouble to save you.

461
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,790
What?

462
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,030
Do you want to die easily?

463
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,421
No, I'm wrong.

464
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:05,461
Let go.

465
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,350
I owed you in my last life.

466
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,910
In this life,

467
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,030
I'm here to repay you.

468
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,990
In this life, I owe you.

469
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,750
In my next life,

470
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,750
I'll repay you.

471
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,390
By the way,

472
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,689
Mr. Li is coming.

473
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:27,043
Mr. Li?

474
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:29,270
Do you mean Li Gongxiang?

475
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,070
Yes.

476
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,510
After the disaster relief in Yuxia,

477
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,270
the people are furious.

478
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,750
The disaster relief fund
from the Imperial Court

479
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,430
only made a small dent.

480
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,350
Mr. Li and I

481
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,950
will go back to Jiangnan and find a way.

482
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,750
Unfortunately, our family

483
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,270
is not what it used to be.

484
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,350
We can't help you anymore.

485
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,750
Please, sir.

486
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
Please, sir.

487
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,190
Please give me some food.

488
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:57,958
Please, sir.

489
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,230
Sir.

490
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,030
It belonged to your mother when she was alive.

491
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,350
The Empress was relegated to limbo

492
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,710
and not allowed to go out
for the rest of her life.

493
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,270
His Majesty

494
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,990
made Noble Consort Xue Empress Wenxiao.

495
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,270
Her coffin will be buried
in the imperial mausoleum.

496
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,790
But you should keep it to yourself.

497
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,696
He will be beheaded soon.

498
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,470
He wants to see you.

499
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,670
Who is he?

500
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,190
His bad father?

501
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,830
No, he's not going.

502
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,590
What's the good of seeing him?

503
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,950
Even if Huai'en will go, he won't be nice.

504
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,630
Look at Huai'en.

505
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,454
Hasn't he suffered enough?

506
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:08,414
I'm warning you.

507
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:09,975
I forbid you to go.

508
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,135
Look at yourself.

509
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,408
You're covered in wounds.

510
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,190
He's a freak.

511
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,149
If it weren't for him,

512
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:18,470
you wouldn't have lost your parents
since you were a child,

513
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,750
you wouldn't have become a killer,

514
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,790
and my parents wouldn't have been involved.

515
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,543
Even…

516
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,397
Even Xiaoyu's parents wouldn't have been dead.

517
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,597
He deserves to die.

518
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:29,043
He'll go to hell.

519
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,350
I listen to Xiaobao.

520
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,700
Xiaobao.

521
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,230
Don't be rude.

522
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,910
It's all right.

523
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:42,910
Something went wrong.

524
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,950
There are some refugees from Yuxia outside.

525
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,270
It's chaos up out there.

526
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:56,818
Please.

527
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:59,658
I haven't eaten in three days.

528
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,310
Don't crowd.

529
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,661
Stand back, everybody. Be careful.

530
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,535
One at a time.

531
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,950
Step back.

532
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,150
Don't crowd.

533
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,430
Don't crowd.

534
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,790
All right. Everyone will have it.

535
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,590
Everyone will have it.

536
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,430
Yuxia…

537
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,070
Wait for your turn.

538
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,552
Can't wait.

539
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,150
The immediate priority
is to reassure these victims.

540
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,510
If they stir things up,

541
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,390
there will be trouble.

542
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,150
If I were in Jiangnan,

543
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,510
I would…

544
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,430
Don't crowd.

545
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,750
Brother, why are there so many people?

546
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,550
What's the point of talking about that?

547
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,950
We can't even protect ourselves.

548
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,870
Really?

549
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,350
Dad, how many possessions

550
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,270
were you hiding?

551
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,150
Really?

552
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,230
That's so much.

553
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,330
Su Yin.

554
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:06,930
Su Yin.

555
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,790
We're saved.

556
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,550
You don't have to go to Jiangnan.

557
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,510
Huai'en didn't give the possessions my dad hid

558
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,110
to his bad dad.

559
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,823
We still have them. They are all yours.

560
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,590
Great.

561
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,350
Wait a second.

562
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,150
Wait a second.

563
00:37:32,956 --> 00:37:33,956
Wait for your turn.

564
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,470
Be careful.

565
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,150
Be careful.

566
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,070
Move forward.

567
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,543
Thank you.

568
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,390
Move forward.

569
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,310
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

570
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,450
Don't crowd.

571
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,238
Thank you.

572
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:56,050
Everyone will have it.

573
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,873
Everyone will have it.

574
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,310
Thank you.

575
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,110
Take it.

576
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:03,365
Move forward.

577
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,813
Here, take it.

578
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,099
No rush. Everyone will have it.

579
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,270
Here.

580
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,150
Here you are.

581
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,110
Wait for your turn.

582
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,910
Thank you.

583
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,470
Thank you.

584
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,350
Thank you.

585
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,390
Thank you.

586
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,630
Thank you.

587
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,430
Here.

588
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,990
Be careful.

589
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,630
Thank you.

590
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,470
Here.

591
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,184
Here you are.

592
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:28,864
Move forward.

593
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,750
Take care.

594
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,870
My father asked me to learn from you.

595
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,830
Don't think I asked him to come here.

596
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,910
Su Yin.

597
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,870
I don't know

598
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,390
when we'll see each other after you leave.

599
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,253
I haven't repaid you.

600
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:54,413
Come on.

601
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,190
I'm not dead.

602
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,252
You're a man.

603
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:02,190
Don't be such a baby.

604
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,150
It's none of your business.

605
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,710
How dare you be rude to me?

606
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,030
You're just the emperor's son.

607
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,390
Huai'en is also the emperor's son.

608
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,390
And he's your elder brother.

609
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:11,398
In that case,

610
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,110
I'm also your elder brother.

611
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,510
If you're so rude again,

612
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,774
I won't spare you.

613
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:17,454
I dare you.

614
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,239
Let's go.

615
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,073
Yin.

616
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:30,193
Wait for me.

617
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,270
Go.

618
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,440
Go.

619
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,040
Go.

620
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,600
Go.

621
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:51,911
Go.

622
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,550
Come on.

623
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,470
Let go of me.

624
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,488
Come on.

625
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,648
All right.

626
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:37,990
Xiaoyu, are you sure
you don't want to go with our parents?

627
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,709
There is no way to find out
what happened back then.

628
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:44,470
Your birth parents and brother

629
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,737
were no longer there.

630
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,910
Brother.

631
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,910
I don't understand adult business.

632
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,590
I just want to live with you.

633
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,870
Is that okay?

634
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,910
Of course.

635
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,356
Does he agree?

636
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,942
He wouldn't dare disagree.

637
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,809
Is it okay?

638
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,378
Higher.

639
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:18,030
How about now?

640
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,177
Higher.

641
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:19,737
Okay.

642
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,510
How about it?

643
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,230
It's great.

644
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,840
Put this plant over there.

645
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay.

646
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,760
There.

647
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:41,294
Put this over there.

648
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:42,230
Okay.

649
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,390
They're doing great.

650
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,830
One person can do the work of several people.

651
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,390
Yeah.

652
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,590
They're great.

653
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,126
Lord.

654
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:03,886
Lord.

655
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,562
Lord.

656
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:09,822
How are you, Lord?

657
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:19,652
All right.

658
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:21,346
Okay.

659
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,030
It's nice.

660
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,559
Jin's mansion.

661
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,070
Let's go.

662
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,550
Okay.

663
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,569
Put me down.
Put me down.

664
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:56,324
How about it?

665
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,047
It's beautiful.

666
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:58,607
Right?

667
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,889
Look.

668
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,668
That tree.

669
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,388
It looks good.

670
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:15,710
Good.

671
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,990
You're recovering fast.

672
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,230
It's scarred.

673
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:21,579
I told you that I'm fine.

674
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,059
You don't know what you were like at the time.

675
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,350
You were dying.

676
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,294
If I had arrived late…

677
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:29,430
If I had arrived late…

678
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,470
I won't die.

679
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,830
We've been through a lot.

680
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,710
We can't take risks in the future.

681
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,870
We should live a happy life.

682
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:47,990
I want to do business to revive our Jin family.

683
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,910
You can't give me a baby.

684
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:50,870
Then…

685
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,406
You could be my good wife.

686
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:54,366
How about it?

687
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,819
You have lost weight.

688
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,454
Of course.

689
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:05,694
You can see my collarbone.

690
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,203
Brother.

691
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:19,484
Brother.

692
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:20,724
- Crack walnuts for me.
- Xiaoyu.

693
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:23,828
Okay.

694
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,121
Crack walnuts.

695
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,041
Okay.

696
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,487
Crack walnuts.

697
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:38,447
Crack walnuts.

698
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,098
You look cute today.

699
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:56,609
What's wrong?

700
00:44:57,553 --> 00:44:58,753
Xiaoyu finally left.

701
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,750
Brother.

702
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,670
Your hands are nice.

703
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,630
Of course.

704
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:34,085
Brother.

705
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:05,707
Why are you everywhere?

706
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:23,784
Huai'en, look at mine.

707
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:27,731
It's so high.

708
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:35,854
You should…

709
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:37,926
Come on.

710
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:38,541
Okay.

711
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,758
Take it easy.

712
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:40,598
Don't rush.

713
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:42,110
That's right.

714
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,870
What are you looking at?

715
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,270
You look cute.

716
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,003
Are you shy?

717
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:06,910
Should we have a wedding?

718
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,550
We can make two identical wedding outfits.

719
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:12,710
Speaking of that,

720
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,630
I don't think I've ever seen you in red.

721
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,630
You must look good in it.

722
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,561
If you want to see it,

723
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:20,441
I'll wear it.

724
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,950
Okay.

725
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,910
We'll have our wedding in this yard.

726
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:28,550
We'll bring my parents back.

727
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,590
And we'll ask the miracle doctor
to bring Jinbao back.

728
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,470
And we'll send an invitation to Su Yin.

729
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:42,550
Come on.

730
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,595
I haven't seen Su Yin in a long time.

731
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:46,251
Besides,

732
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:48,491
I don't know how he's doing in Yuxia.

733
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,190
I haven't seen him for a long time.

734
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,350
I miss him.

735
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,610
Otherwise, we'll…

736
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:02,684
Let's go.

737
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:03,324
Where are we going?

738
00:48:03,324 --> 00:48:04,004
We are going to the bridal chamber.

739
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,790
What about the paper kites?

740
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,032
Come on.

741
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:07,872
We don't need them.

742
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:16,756
[Meet You at the Blossom]
