1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,920
The deceased emperor Jiayun was
fatuous and ruthless, and also dissipated.

2
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,640
He paid no attention to governing the country,
which caused chaos all over the nations.

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,440
People had nothing to depend on
for their living.

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,560
The courtiers decided to elect
the new emperor to the throne.

5
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,760
The Crown Prince Zongzheng Yunlian
was in the prime of his life,

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,720
and had great contributions,
standing high in popular favor.

7
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,880
However, Jiayun's second son Zongzheng Yuzhan
had wild ambitions.

8
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
He attempted to usurp the throne.

9
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,680
After the Crown Prince ascended the throne,
Yuzhan's title was abolished.

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
He was relegated to a commoner,
and exiled for thousands of miles away.

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,600
After the new emperor acceded to the throne,
he decisively rectified the nation,

12
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,760
resisted foreign aggression
and pacified the interior within a decade,

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,040
leading the Zhongzheng Dynasty
out of the turbulent era of hundreds of years.

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,200
Amazing!

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
Cloth tigers here. Come and have a look.

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Cloth tigers.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,200
Cloth tigers of great fun.

18
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
- Look at this.
- Look at these paintings.

19
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,880
- That's amazing.
- This is a real deal.

20
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Yes, you can't make it.

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
Neither can you.

22
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,720
My Master. The kite is flying up.

23
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
- Be careful.
- That's fun!

24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,720
Look, my Master.

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
Fly it higher, Master.

26
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,760
It's about to fly.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,480
It's flying.

28
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,600
You have to retract the line, my Master.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Hold on to it.

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,320
- Look at it.
- It's flying so high.

31
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,560
- Well done, my Master.
- It's flying so high.

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Flying really high there, my Master.

33
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,340
[Ten years later]

34
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,320
Uncle, I remember that
the Jins asked you to write

35
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,480
the history of how the Jinqian Gang
has become the richest

36
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
in areas south of the Yangtze, didn't they?

37
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,720
Then why do you praise them
throughout the article?

38
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
Master Sun.

39
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
Master Sun.

40
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
My Master Jin. You are here.

41
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,760
The book has been revised as you ordered.
Please take a look.

42
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
Look. It says that on the day when
the Young Master Jin was born,

43
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,600
the propitious Purple Air came from the east.

44
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,320
Since then on, everything of the
Zhongzheng Dynasty has taken on a new look

45
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,600
with bountiful goods and prosperous people.

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,520
The physiognomist said that you are
the auspicious sign coming to earth.

47
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,360
The Jins have then caught a break.

48
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,160
The Master Jin, your father,
has become very rich and honorable.

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,840
And the Jins' money house
has made a really big fortune.

50
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,560
- Besides, my Master is even more a gifted boy.
- Master Sun is really talented.

51
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,240
With just a little bit of prompt,
you are able to write such a masterpiece.

52
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,320
Thank you, my Master.

53
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,320
But I don't mean to brag about myself.

54
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,640
Well, I am here today
to propose a marriage to Miss Liu.

55
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:19,200
But before that, the girls everywhere
had some misunderstandings about me,

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,037
which failed all my previous marriages.

57
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,720
But now, given that you can help me
clarify this situation,

58
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,640
Miss Liu and I may be able
to put aside the prejudices of each other,

59
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,000
so as to tie the knot.

60
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, of course.

61
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,800
But, the diction in this book
still needs more discretion and effort.

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,180
Could you pick some words that I know?

63
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,140
[Mount Jinqi]

64
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,600
My Lord. The Lord is calling you in.

65
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Zongzheng Yunlian is preying on us covetously.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Laosi must have been already on the alert.

67
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,520
You must be quite careful
to finish this mission.

68
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,120
As long as you can successfully complete it,

69
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,320
I would give you whatever you want.

70
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Stop!

71
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,120
My Master.
Why do you have to set off at midnight?

72
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
It's really dark and windy outside.

73
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,200
- What if we come across something ghostly?
- Shut up.

74
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Stop talking about the sinister words.

75
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,640
My Master, if we keep staying here,
they may be angry with us,

76
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
and pay someone to kill us.

77
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,440
You're really a genius!

78
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,800
I just can't figure it out.

79
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,640
I am the young leader of the first gang
under heaven,

80
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,720
of good appearance, and commendable character.

81
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,280
Why is there no girl who adores me?

82
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,320
My Master.

83
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,040
You can't really blame them.

84
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,680
How could you propose a marriage
to three girls at the same time?

85
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,240
But the three girls are
all gorgeous beauties.

86
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
They all looked at me with smiling eyes.

87
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,320
Obviously they were interested in me.

88
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
So it was hard for me to make a choice.

89
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
This also put me in a dilemma.

90
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
You'd better think about
how to explain it to the Master.

91
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
You have been refused for numerous times.

92
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,280
I don't believe that I, Jin Xiaobao,
can not find someone to marry.

93
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,640
I will marry a woman
who is the most beautiful in the world.

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,240
I will give her
all the most precious treasures in the world.

95
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,783
I'll treat her as the apple of my eye
to piss off those senseless ones.

96
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,720
What happened?

97
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,160
We didn't really encounter
anything ghostly, right?

98
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
There's a fight.

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
They look skillful.

100
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
My Master.

101
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,600
A fairy.

102
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,160
The fairy descends to earth.

103
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Go to her rescue.
Hurry up. Help my wife.

104
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
What?

105
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,741
Help that fairy.

106
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,920
Is there any woman in the world
more beautiful than her?

107
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,520
God treats me so well.

108
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,560
I could actually meet such a stunning beauty.

109
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
Hurry up.

110
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,200
I won't marry anyone but her.

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
My Master, please calm down.

112
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,280
As novels say, such a woman
appearing at midnight in the deep forests

113
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
most likely isn't a good person.

114
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,440
She may be here specifically to cheat
those young men with pure goodness like you.

115
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,520
By the way, before going out,
the Master repeatedly instructed

116
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,440
Jinbao and me to protect you.

117
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,520
If anything happens to you,
how can we explain it to the Master?

118
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,240
That's a load of nonsense.
If you don't help her, I will.

119
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,280
Don't be afraid, my wife.

120
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,080
- Your husband is coming to help you.
- Be careful, my Master.

121
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,360
Please go in and hide.

122
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Come on. Let's go.

123
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,040
You're bleeding a lot.

124
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
Zhao... Zhaocai, Jinbao!

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,960
Call a doctor, now!

126
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,040
My Master. Please take a break.

127
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,440
You're making me so dizzy.

128
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm worrying about her.
The doctor's been inside for so long.

129
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
My wife will be fine, right?

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,906
Your marriage with her has not even
got to the first base!

131
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:10,280
And she comes from nowhere.
So just stop calling her your wife.

132
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,000
I like to call her this way.

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
Stop being suspicious of her origin.

134
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,560
I won't get married with anyone but her.

135
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,920
Be respectful to your future Lady.

136
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
She must be out visiting relatives.
And those bad guys coveted her beauty.

137
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,360
- Weitang...
- Where is this place?

138
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,120
Weitang Town. Jins' separate mansion.

139
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
- How far is this from Huaizhou?
- The gentlemen like me...

140
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
If the carriage keeps traveling day and night,
it will take only one day.

141
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,960
She must be deeply moved.

142
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I told you, I'll only marry
the most beautiful person in the world.

143
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,800
Who are the people out there?

144
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,280
- And I finally met her.
- Jin... Jinqian Gang's people.

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
Jinqian Gang?

146
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,680
I'll present my heart to her,
offer her the best treasures of the world,

147
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,120
and spare no efforts to serve her.

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I think, as long as I'm sincere enough to her,
we will then fall in love with each other.

149
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
She won't marry any men but me.

150
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,520
In this way, we are going to...

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,195
Doctor, how is my wife?

152
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,680
Your wife?

153
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,960
Fine. Pretty... pretty good.

154
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,000
She just needs to rest for a few days.

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,080
I have to go.

156
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,800
Hey, doctor.

157
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,840
Did my majestic figure frighten him?

158
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,680
Miss. Are you okay?

159
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,280
You need not be afraid.

160
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,840
My name is Jin Xiaobao,
the young leader of the Jinqian Gang.

161
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,400
I don't know whether
you have ever heard of it.

162
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,360
The young leader?

163
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,329
Don't worry.

164
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,040
Although I am not
from an ordinary family,

165
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm still a humble and courteous man.

166
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't save you from danger
regardless of my own safety last night, right?

167
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,040
By the way, I still don't know your name.

168
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
Zheng Huaien.

169
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,960
What a nice name!

170
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,560
Why were you alone in
that wilderness last night,

171
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,280
and why were you attacked by those
vicious people?

172
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,080
Have you encountered any trouble?

173
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,560
You can tell me, miss.

174
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
My family has some fame and prestige
in society.

175
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I am willing to help you out, doing my bit.

176
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,240
Thanks to Master Jin
for your righteousness and rescue.

177
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,120
It was just an accident last night.

178
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,880
Actually, I come to the south
to visit my relatives.

179
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,920
You don't have to worry about it.

180
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,880
Just as I expected.

181
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,080
But right now, I have an important business
to rush to Huaizhou.

182
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,960
I am wondering where you are headed to?

183
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,120
If we're going in different directions,
I have to take my leave.

184
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,720
You're also going to Huaizhou?
What a coincidence.

185
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,120
I am going there, too.

186
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,920
So, why don't we go there together?

187
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,440
Well, I'm afraid I have to bother you.

188
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,360
Let's set off now.

189
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,680
Take your time.

190
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,840
Look, you haven't recovered yet.

191
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,000
It's better to rest for a few days
before we set off, right?

192
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,680
Besides, Weitang Town has
lots of splendid sceneries.

193
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,840
Why don't we drink a cup of tea
and enjoy the scenery?

194
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
It won't take long.

195
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,560
I have something important to cope with,
so I cannot spent much time here.

196
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,000
If you don't agree, then thank you for
your rescue, I have to get on my way.

197
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,359
I didn't say no. I agree. Let's go now. Okay?

198
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,400
Zhaocai, Jinbao. Saddle up for departure.

199
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

200
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,280
Miss Zheng. Don't get me wrong.

201
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,880
I was killing mosquitoes for you just now.

202
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,920
You are unfamiliar with this place.
There are lots of mosquitoes in this forest.

203
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,960
You know, there's a big mosquito
watching you all the time just now.

204
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,280
Don't worry.
You can sleep soundly with me here.

205
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,320
Miss Zheng. You...

206
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
Miss Zheng.

207
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
You scared me to death.

208
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,720
My Master. The Master and Lady
are asking you to return home.

209
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,120
It is really time to go home.

210
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,840
You. Go and find two skilled fighters,
to protect your young Lady,

211
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,920
in case her enemies come after her again.

212
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,557
Got it.

213
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:36,680
But Master, I thought you said that Miss Zheng
was simply targeted by bad guys.

214
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,040
Just agree with what I say.

215
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,480
Are you disobeying me now?

216
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,800
Master's right.

217
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
By the way, keep this a secret from my father.

218
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Yes.

219
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,440
Mother, Father. I'm back.

220
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,840
Xiaobao.

221
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,920
You little brat.

222
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
I thought you had forgotten the way home.

223
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,520
This is my home. How's that possible?

224
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,240
Do you miss me, Mother?

225
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,000
I am glad that you are home.

226
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,040
I've got lots of souvenirs this time. I brought
you and Xiaoyu some beautiful silks and satins,

227
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,160
to make some beautiful clothes for you two.

228
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,560
Good.

229
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,200
Brother Xiaobao.

230
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,080
Brother Xiaobao.

231
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
Xiaoyu.

232
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,920
You got heavier.

233
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,240
- Be careful, don't fall.
- No, I didn't.

234
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
No, she won't.

235
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,240
Brother won't make me fall.

236
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,120
Come here, Xiaobao.
I need to ask you something.

237
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,640
You went to visit Miss Liu this time, right?
Do you like her?

238
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,360
Well, Miss Liu and I are not a good match.

239
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,160
Why?

240
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,920
The Lius is a centennial and noble family.

241
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,400
Miss Liu is both talented and beautiful.

242
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,800
It took your father and I lots of efforts
to ask Master Liu for a meeting of you two.

243
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,040
Well...

244
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Dear...

245
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,560
I will handle it.

246
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,680
Xiaobao. Come with me.

247
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,120
Okay, Father.

248
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,000
Brother.

249
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Alright. Xiaoyu and I are going
to check if dinner is ready.

250
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,760
Father.

251
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,640
Father. Why are you still coughing?

252
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,480
I sent back some medicine two days ago.
Have you received it?

253
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Yes.

254
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,680
How's it going?

255
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,840
I heard that you failed to propose
a marriage this time,

256
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,720
but brought back a stunning beauty halfway,
and declared that you'd marry no one but her.

257
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
- Father.
- You silly boy.

258
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,600
If you indulge yourself in beauty,
you will die from women sooner or later.

259
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,240
You will make a blunder because of women.

260
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,400
Father. She's different.

261
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,320
I am serious about her.

262
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
Serious about her?

263
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,320
What you said is what the girls in the
courtyard and Yicui Building are tired of.

264
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,560
Father. She is really different.

265
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,920
She's of refined temperament.

266
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,640
No matter how much gold and jewelry I gave her,
she doesn't even take a look.

267
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Xiaobao. I'm telling you,

268
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,240
There are two kinds of people
who don't care about your money in the world.

269
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,480
One is someone who wants more from you.

270
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,080
The other is someone who wants all your money.

271
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,800
People who don't want a penny like this
are the most dangerous ones.

272
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,640
I heard Zhaocai said that she
appeared in the wilderness at midnight,

273
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
and was being hunted down by her enemies.

274
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,240
You have to find out her background,
understand?

275
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
That damn Zhaocai.

276
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,520
What?

277
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,960
You are absolutely right, Father.

278
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm just about to send Zhang Chun
to investigate carefully.

279
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,160
Is there any origin
that Zhang Chun can't figure out in this world?

280
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,480
Don't worry, Father. Unless I have
a thorough grasp of her background,

281
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,360
I would not send betrothal gifts
and money over to her,

282
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,480
and I won't be blinded by beauty, either.

283
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
- Xiaobao.
- Father,

284
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,920
the Chinese opera troupe from the capital city
is having their last performance today, right?

285
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,440
- Huh?
- Father, I'll talk with you after I come back.

286
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,560
- Wait for me to return.
- What?

287
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Xiaobao. Xiaobao.

288
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Is someone here?

289
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,400
My Lord. Sorry that I was late,
and caused you to get injured.

290
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Please punish me.

291
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
You are here.

292
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,600
It was not all your fault.

293
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,040
It was I who insisted on going
to Prince Shen's Mansion.

294
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,840
Where's the stuff I asked you to bring?

295
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,320
I have to dress up like this for a while.

296
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,720
Without my orders,
you and Youying mustn't take any action.

297
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
My Lord. We've already alerted the enemy.

298
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,280
Why do you have to dress up like this yet?

299
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,240
The fool who saved me that day
is the young leader of Jinqian Gang.

300
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,320
If I could make use of him to...

301
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,440
Miss Zheng. I'm visiting you again.

302
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,320
You may not know this,
but in the few hours that I haven't seen you,

303
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,600
it felt like years.

304
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,600
Fallen asleep?

305
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,880
Miss Zheng!

306
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,280
I came here today to
invite you to go to the opera.

307
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,320
It's the Xiyue troupe from the capital city.
This is its last performance in Huaizhou.

308
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,160
The dignitaries who are present today
are big celebrities.

309
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,080
There's Lingyang Magistrate,
Liuchuan Magistrate...

310
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,760
Even Prince Shen is coming.

311
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Our private room
is not inferior to any of those big shots.

312
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,280
It took me a lot of effort to grab the spot.

313
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,640
Saddle up. I'm coming.

314
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,677
Alright. I'll get right on it.

315
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,800
Zhaocai, Jinbao.
Saddle up for departure.

316
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,040
The roster is missing. It's strange that Prince
Shen is still in the mood to go to the opera.

317
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,640
My Lord. Be careful. It may be a trick.

318
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Waiting here is not an option.

319
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,160
Ask Youying to check it out with a few people
in Prince Shen's mansion.

320
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,600
You secretly follow me with a few people.

321
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,160
I want to know what kind of trick
this Prince Shen is going to play.

322
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,480
Yes, sir.

323
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,920
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

324
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
You dared to tell my father behind my back?

325
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,640
No. The Master kept questioning me.

326
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,680
Then I had to tell him the whole story.

327
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,480
You can tell him at least
after I figure everything out.

328
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,080
These beautiful ornaments are on sale.

329
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,120
Come and have a look.

330
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,680
My Master.

331
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,800
Come on.

332
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,640
Is he the son of Jin Bao?

333
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
Exactly.

334
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
Looks like a useless one, just as I expected.

335
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,800
He is Jin Bao's one and only child.

336
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,880
I heard that he really spoils this kid.

337
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
Be careful.

338
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,800
What a tall girl!

339
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,000
She is so beautiful.

340
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,120
I cannot imagine how gorgeous she is
under this veil.

341
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,760
Your Highness.

342
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,880
No need for overly courtesy, Master Jin.

343
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,520
Recently, there have been lots of rumors
in Huaizhou.

344
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,720
They said that Master Jin
found a stunning beauty in a certain place.

345
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,440
These have already spread to my Yizhou.

346
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,840
You must be joking, your Highness.

347
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,000
I went out of town to do business
the other day.

348
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
Then I happened to meet Miss Zheng.

349
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,560
She was being attacked by bandits at that time.

350
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,120
So I risked my life to save her.

351
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,080
Miss Zheng is still in shock.

352
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,440
So she's going to spend a few days
recuperating in Huaizhou.

353
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,160
I will send her back in a few days.

354
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,400
So that's how it is.

355
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,040
Miss Zheng. Where's your home?

356
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,480
I will return to Yizhou in a few days.

357
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,600
If we are heading in the same direction,
why don't we go together?

358
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,280
We wouldn't dare to bother you, your Highness.

359
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,120
I will send Miss Zheng back in person.

360
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,880
My father has always taught me
to see matters through till the end.

361
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,080
Leader Jin is indeed a good teacher.

362
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,960
In that case, I shall not force you.

363
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,520
Miss Zheng is so graceful and refined.

364
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,400
You must come from a scholarly family, right?

365
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,360
Although I may look boorish, but I indulge
in art and literature occasionally.

366
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,640
Are you available tonight, Miss Zheng?
We can have a drink under the moon.

367
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,360
My mansion in Huaizhou is not far from here.

368
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,840
This old man is quite lecherous!

369
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
He's asking my wife to go to his mansion?

370
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,800
He is...

371
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,520
Thanks for your appreciation, your Highness.

372
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,360
I'll visit you again another day.

373
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,480
Today I'm a little tired.

374
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Master Jin. I don't want to watch the play.

375
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,040
Let's go.

376
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,480
You're tired?

377
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,200
Why are you tired so suddenly?

378
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Yes, sir.

379
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,360
Miss Zheng, you may not be aware,

380
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,520
Although that Prince Shen looks decent,

381
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,000
he actually has lots of wives
and concubines in his mansion.

382
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,080
He even visits brothels
and wine shops at times.

383
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,400
When he meets a beauty,
he cannot even think rationally.

384
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,480
Don't be fooled by his heroic
and stable figure.

385
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
And he's too old.

386
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,200
You're at the best age of your life,
and you are so beautiful.

387
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,480
I'm sure you're not interested in him, right?

388
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,920
How about me?

389
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,000
I like you. I really do.

390
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
What's wrong?

391
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,953
What's wrong?

392
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh, no. Is she really going to Prince Shen?

393
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,640
Zhaocai, Jinbao. Go and get my wife back!

394
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,495
But the horse was ridden away.
How do we chase her back?

395
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,520
My Lord.

396
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,640
Huaien. You are really tenacious.

397
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,160
I almost didn't recognize you.

398
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,360
Uncle, you are really strong despite your age.

399
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,960
You chased your nephew
so desperately at midnight.

400
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,280
I don't really understand.

401
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,680
I accidentally lost something a few days ago.

402
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,160
I guess it was you who mischievously stole it.

403
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,000
Give it back.

404
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,520
You are really joking, Uncle.

405
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,920
I have no stuff that belongs to you,
but only to my father.

406
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,920
And what my father wants to do with it,
I'm sure you know it clearly.

407
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,400
This nation wasn't
supposed to be yours, was it?

408
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,600
How rude!

409
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,440
Your father disregards the nation
and people just to satisfy his selfish desire.

410
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,400
How can such a man become the emperor?

411
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,520
It's not up to you to decide, Uncle.

412
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,120
Huaien.

413
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,360
Your father has been blinded by hatred
for so many years.

414
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,560
He has been thinking about revenge for decades.

415
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,760
If he's the one who governs the whole nation,

416
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,480
can people really live a peaceful
and prosperous life?

417
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
You are almost in your twenties.

418
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,280
You should be able to tell right from wrong.

419
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,360
People of the world have
nothing to do with me.

420
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,120
Right or wrong, I don't care at all.

421
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,120
So stubborn. Kill him.

422
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,680
Protect the Lord!

423
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,840
Why isn't there anyone in sight yet?

424
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,440
Are you sure this is the right direction?

425
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,840
Yes, my Master.

426
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,080
The red cloud horse has your special balm
on it.

427
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,040
The scent can be smelt around here.

428
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,880
But what are they doing here in the wilderness?

429
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,080
Look, my Master.

430
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,200
Miss Zheng. Where are you, Miss Zheng?

431
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,800
My wife. Huaien.

432
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,520
My wife!

433
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,840
Zhaocai, Jinbao. Let's split up.
Go and find my wife.

434
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,000
We can't.

435
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,920
My Master, we don't know
this lady's background.

436
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,840
She said she came to Huaizhou for business.
But I've never seen her go out.

437
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,960
And she has been attacked so frequently.
Now, she even provoked Prince Shen.

438
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,920
My Master, please don't get involved in this.

439
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,120
You know nothing.
I don't care who she is.

440
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,520
Since she's been my wife, I must protect her.

441
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,120
I am the young leader of Jinqian Gang.

442
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
If I cannot even protect my wife,
what kind of man am I?

443
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,560
But my Master, it's too dangerous
for you to go alone.

444
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,720
That's not important now.

445
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,209
Given my father's relationship
with the Su family,

446
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,480
the people in Prince Shen's mansion
dare not do anything to me.

447
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,720
Hurry up! If anything happens to my wife
because we're late, neither of you can live.

448
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,960
I...

449
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,120
My Master, remember, if you're in any danger,
hide as best as you can.

450
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,080
If you can't hide, feign death.
If it really doesn't work...

451
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,320
Goodness!

452
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,880
- My Master!
- My Master!

453
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Miss Zheng! Miss Zheng!

454
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,840
Miss Zheng! Miss Zheng!

455
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Miss Zheng!

456
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,240
Miss Zheng...

457
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,080
Don't come over. Don't come over!

458
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't come over.

459
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,120
Go and save my Lord.

460
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,560
You... You said...

461
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,720
Are you talking about Huaien?

462
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,800
This is the best medicine from the West,
for wounds.

463
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,480
Whether you can survive depends on you.

464
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Good luck.

465
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Miss Zheng!

466
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,800
Miss Zheng! Miss Zheng!

467
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,120
Hope that old man isn't a liar.

468
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Die, you little bastard!

469
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,520
Stop!

470
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,560
Miss Zheng, are you okay?

471
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,000
It's all my fault for being late. Are you okay?

472
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,039
Don't worry. I'm here.

473
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,000
Who are you?

474
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,280
I am the young leader of
Jinqian Gang from the south.

475
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,720
This girl is my future wife.

476
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
You're not going to lay a finger on her.

477
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,273
Your wife? Girl?

478
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,405
Your master is unwilling
to buy you new clothes?

479
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:23,760
I have a bag of gold here. As long as you leave
right now, this bag of gold is all yours.

480
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,040
Throw it over.

481
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,720
I gave you money. You have to let her go.

482
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,480
Since you took the money,
you have to let my wife go.

483
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,000
Brother. Gold.

484
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,720
You have to keep your word.
Take the money and leave right away.

485
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,000
Do not try any tricks.

486
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,121
Not only are we going to let you go,
I'm going to send you to death.

487
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
You... You don't have to bother.

488
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,240
We're poisoned!

489
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,560
You greedy idiots. The money of
Jinqian Gang isn't that easy to get.

490
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,960
You think I'm someone you can easily bully?!

491
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,366
Let's see if you dare to attack my wife now!

492
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
Watch out!

493
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,320
Miss Zheng.

494
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
Miss Zheng. Are you okay?!

495
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,840
At least we managed to hit one.

496
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,880
Too bad we have run out of the deadly ones.

497
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,675
But this is also good.

498
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:39,124
Boy, tonight, you can enter the bridal chamber
with your wife in advance.

499
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
Where's the antidote?
Hand over the antidote now!

500
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,149
Antidote?

501
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,578
How is there possibly an antidote
for aphrodisiac?

502
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,812
Aphrodisiac?
