[Meet You at the Blossom]

17
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,610
Su Yin, listen to me.

18
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,150
Shut up.

19
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,950
Do you know your physical condition?

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,630
Do you know how much it took me to save your life?

21
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,210
Don't you cherish yourself?

22
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,650
You messed up all my plans.

23
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,410
What do you want to do?

24
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,975
Tell me.

25
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,530
I did everything I could
to keep you away from Zongzheng Huai'en.

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,790
What did you do?

27
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,656
Do you have to humble yourself?

28
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,454
Su Yin.

29
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,910
Do you have to kill Huai'en?

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,815
You can't kill him.

31
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,640
Even if you will kill me, I'll say it.

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,130
You can't kill him.

33
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,570
It's not that I don't want him dead.

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,170
It's that you can't kill him, Su Yin.

35
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,015
Although Huai'en was not born and raised in the palace, he is a prince.

36
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:44,990
If you kill him, the Emperor won't let you go.

37
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,890
Even if you have a perfect plan,

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,315
can you deal with the Emperor?

39
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:55,190
If they found it out, what about your career?

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,423
What about your parents?

41
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,656
What about your grandfather,
who wants you to inherit his title?

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
It's karmic justice that our Jin family finds itself

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,830
in its current position today.

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,770
Huai'en did not directly cause all of this.

45
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,725
And no matter how our relationship develops,f

46
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,660
that's a private matter between us.

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,495
I can't get you involved again.

48
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,200
If something happens to you,

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,648
I can repay you in this life, the next life,

50
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:31,516
and the life after the next, Su Yin.

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,060
I know what I am doing.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,643
- Don't worry about it. 
 - But Su Yin…

53
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,456
Xiaobao. I didn't do all this

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,860
so you could make up.

55
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,025
You have to lead a better life.

56
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,533
Zhaocai, Jinbao.

57
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,410
Take him back to Annan.

58
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,250
Let him sleep.

59
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Don't wake him up before you get to Annan.

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,390
Yes.

61
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,150
Go.

62
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,220
- Go. Go.
 - Go.

63
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
- Go. 
 - Go.

64
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,120
- Go. 
 - Go.

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,300
Xiaobao, wait for me.

66
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,625
Go.

67
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,450
- Go. 
 - Go.

68
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,880
Go.

69
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:41,118
We went through all the trouble to get here, but we couldn't get the flower.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,300
What's going on down there?

71
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,280
It looks red.

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,720
What are you doing?

73
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,770
It's been a day and a night.

74
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,520
Is he already dead there?

75
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,048
It's fatal for ordinary people to get the flower.

76
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,593
And so many people have died there.

77
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:13,217
He might have died.

78
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,569
Right, Yin?

79
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,227
Stop.

80
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,680
No.

81
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,900
He must get the crimson dahlia before he dies.

82
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Go.

83
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,780
Go.

84
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,358
Young Master.

85
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,238
Come on. Get some water.

86
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,740
Young Master.

87
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,622
Drink slowly.

88
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:16,410
Zhaocai, how are they…

89
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:19,699
How are they doing?

90
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,113
Zhaocai.

91
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,743
He's dead.

92
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:29,987
What?

93
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,730
It's… It's not true.

94
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,805
It's not true.

95
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:39,430
Look at you.

96
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,550
Do you believe everything people say?

97
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,420
(dialogue)

98
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:46,738
You know the truth, right?

99
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:48,490
Come on, please tell me.

100
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,190
- Please tell me. 
 - Shame on you.

101
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,229
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

102
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,560
What's wrong with you?

103
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,510
- He's not dead, is he? 
 - It's not true.

104
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,590
It's not true.

105
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,949
He's not dead, is he?

106
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,230
Don't touch someone else and then touch me.

107
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,390
I'll touch you.

108
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,150
What can you do about it?
What can you do about it?

109
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,955
I'm touching you. I'm touching you.

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,993
- I…
- I…

111
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:15,109
Cut it out. How are they doing?

112
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:17,222
His Highness is back.

113
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,485
Su Yin, you are back…

114
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,965
I got it.

115
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:41,108
You… What happened to you?

116
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,151
I may be disabled.

117
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,924
What?

118
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,230
What do you mean by that?

119
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,370
Xiaobao. You're worried about me, right?

120
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,282
Don't touch it.

121
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,398
What…

122
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,668
What happened?

123
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,876
It's the poison of the crimson dahlia.

124
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,174
Is there a cure?

125
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,338
It's fine.

126
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:17,315
I don't use a sword with my left hand.

127
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,969
In that case, you can see with one eye.

128
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,042
Why do you need the other one?

129
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:24,279
If you only have one eye,

130
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,400
you will have a blind spot.

131
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,218
Miracle doctor, could you please heal him?

132
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,370
Of course, I can.

133
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,330
Young Master, why do you want to save him?

134
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,510
He deserves it.

135
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,338
- If it weren't for him…
- Leave here.

136
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,250
Go to see Su Yin.

137
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,390
Tell Su Yin to get the weather official.

138
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,614
We must cure your young master

139
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,280
on seven consecutive sunny days before spring.

140
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,830
There's only one chance.

141
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,010
You must be quick.

142
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,710
And you can't lose time.

143
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,210
- Just go. 
 - Will you go?

144
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,313
Just go.

145
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,300
Miracle doctor, can you really save him?

146
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,525
Did you know he would get poisoned?

147
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:16,480
- Why are you telling me this? 
 - I want you to owe me a favor.

148
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,750
Don't give me that look.

149
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,150
Did I poison him, or did I let him pick the flower?

150
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,670
What do you want?

151
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,863
Toxicity of Red Devil Flower.

152
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:43,570
The poison will slowly spread
from wherever you exposed to it to your heart.

153
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,630
When it spreads to your heart,

154
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,110
you are done.

155
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,383
- I don't need…
- I'm willing to.

156
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,210
Jinbao.

157
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,276
Young Master.

158
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:05,103
I'm willing to follow the miracle doctor.

159
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,660
But I didn't do this for you. Don't worry.

160
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,850
It's just…

161
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,440
It's just…

162
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,923
I'm responsible for him.

163
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:15,470
Well.

164
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,260
I don't know what to tell you.

165
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,811
Anyway…

166
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,818
Well.

167
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,750
Que Siming, treat him first.

168
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,400
The last crimson dahlia is on the way.

169
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,589
When the weather official works out the time,

170
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,818
I will heal you.

171
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:02,808
When your poison is cleared,

172
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,690
I'll leave with Jinbao.

173
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,790
If you don't keep your word

174
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:16,346
or say something to shake Jinbao,

175
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,042
I promise

176
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,352
I'll let you suffer from

177
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,661
something more tormenting than this.

178
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,739
What are you talking about?

179
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,715
Jinbao.

180
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,163
Go.

181
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:53,541
Have you had any seizures these days?

182
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,561
Xiaobao.

183
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,187
You still like me, don't you?

184
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,114
You don't want me to die.

185
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't push me.

186
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,588
I'm not pushing you.

187
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:14,676
Xiaobao, I just want
to go back to the old days.

188
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:19,640
You're making me sound like a betrayer.

189
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,548
We're where we are today because of you.

190
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes.

191
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,140
It's all my fault.

192
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,480
Xiaobao,

193
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
What do you want me to do 
 so that we can go back to the old days?

194
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,742
There are no old days.

195
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,716
There are.

196
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,180
Xiaobao.

197
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,265
As long as you're willing to treat me
as before,

198
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:41,760
I swear I'll do everything you say.

199
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:46,262
If we can't go back to the old days,

200
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,880
I can only follow my own ideas.

201
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,622
I don't know what I'm going to do.

202
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,342
Let me think about it.

203
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:08,716
What if we can't find the last crimson dahlia?

204
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:09,756
No.

205
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,362
I'm sure we'll find it.

206
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,244
I promise you.

207
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,716
Why did you get back with Su Yin?

208
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,131
Didn't he want to kill you?

209
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,415
He did try to kill me.

210
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,438
Stop.

211
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,260
Stop.

212
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,716
Mr. Li, what are you doing here?

213
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:14,609
His Majesty ordered me to protect the first prince.

214
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,272
He's not the first prince.

215
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,180
Li Gongxiang.

216
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,463
You traitor.

217
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:25,428
Did you know who he was a long time ago?

218
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,266
Did you cheat with Noble Consort Xue,

219
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,844
like my mother said?

220
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,374
Is Huai'en your son?

221
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,135
Your Royal Highness, please watch your mouth.

222
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,970
Your Royal Highness.

223
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,490
Instead of trying to root out dissents,

224
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,690
why don't you think about how to make contributions?

225
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,030
Jiuzhou suffered a flood.

226
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,430
The people are suffering.

227
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,900
There was a plague in Yuxiao. 
 There were many dead and wounded.

228
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,170
The uncivilized tribes
are harassing the border.

229
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,327
And the second prince didn't change his original intention and wanted to rebel.

230
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,090
Your Royal Highness,

231
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,670
as the crown prince of the country,

232
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,250
do you care about the country and the people?

233
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,410
You're obsessed with love.

234
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,172
How can you inherit the throne?

235
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,239
Li Gongxiang.

236
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,085
How dare you?

237
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,539
Yin.

238
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,634
Mr. Li.

239
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,272
You're right.

240
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,090
It's His Majesty's order.

241
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,769
Your Highness, I need a little relief.

242
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,166
So you let him go.

243
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,041
Let him go?

244
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,030
No way.

245
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,370
Do you think Li Gongxiang

246
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,433
was there to help him?

247
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,970
Do you know what this is?

248
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,070
It's just a piece of gold.

249
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,252
It's no use telling you.

250
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,030
Anyway,

251
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,730
I won't let him go easily.

252
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,900
Su Qi.

253
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,265
I think you need medical attention.

254
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,133
Young Master, I can't serve you in the future.

255
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,440
Please don't blame me.

256
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,220
Come on. Get up. Get up.

257
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,333
I won't.

258
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,661
How can I blame you?

259
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,045
If it weren't for me,

260
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,460
you wouldn't have to serve him.

261
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,302
No, Young Master.

262
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:39,000
Actually,

263
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,820
he is nice to me.

264
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,360
It's not what you see.

265
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,345
Young Master, sit down.

266
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,575
Young Master.

267
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,142
Actually,

268
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:56,748
I like him.

269
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,634
What?

270
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,953
What do you like about him?

271
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,300
He looks intimidating.

272
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:10,617
Young Master, if you take a closer look,

273
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,252
he's handsome.

274
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,759
Can he compare with Huai'en?

275
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,120
Did my relationship with Huai'en affect you?

276
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,524
Didn't you like girls before?

277
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:26,770
Yeah.

278
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,078
No, Young Master.

279
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,263
Actually,

280
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:32,184
We've known each other since we were kids.

281
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:35,160
What?

282
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,176
We were neighbors back then.

283
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,750
He was kind to me.

284
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,850
Later, my family declined.

285
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,710
A trafficker bought me.

286
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,250
Then we lost touch.

287
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,707
After a long time,

288
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:50,450
I forgot what he looked like.

289
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,638
What a coincidence.

290
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,110
It's not a coincidence.

291
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,357
He's been practicing medicine all these years to look for me.

292
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,110
Actually, the day he first met me, he recognized me.

293
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,410
But I didn't recognize him.

294
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,630
Later…

295
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,090
Well. You know, he's eccentric.

296
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,530
He didn't want to say it.

297
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,973
Don't move.

298
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,770
It's fake.

299
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,690
It's fake?

300
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,990
It is said that it's the last one in the world.

301
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,776
If this one is fake,

302
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:48,203
there's nothing I can do.

303
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,630
I know a place.

304
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,530
There must be one.

305
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,190
Right.

306
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,992
Tong Sect must have one.

307
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:10,453
Looks like you have to see your crooked father again.

308
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,390
What do you want to do?

309
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,691
Mrs. Jin, don't worry.

310
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,890
Xiaobao.

311
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,772
I will come back.

312
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,040
Mr. Huai'en.

313
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,800
Mr. Huai'en.

314
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,370
Mr. Huai'en.

315
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,992
Please bring this to Xiaoyu.

316
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:47,272
It's my gift to her as a mother.

317
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,405
What's wrong?

318
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:42,240
Do you miss him?

319
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,980
No.

320
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,180
Jin Xiaobao,

321
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,160
if he comes back safely,

322
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,440
what are you going to do with him?

323
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,300
You don't want to make up with him, do you?

324
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,140
No.

325
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,380
I hope you understand

326
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,240
that a man falling in love
with another man is despised.

327
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,760
It's not that you don't like girls.

328
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,176
When he gets the last crimson dahlia for you,

329
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,397
you should break it off with him

330
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,347
and marry some pretty girls

331
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:17,880
to have children for the Jin family.

332
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,060
You can live a carefree life like you used to.

333
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Isn't it good?

334
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:26,173
I can't.

335
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,480
No, you can.

336
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,578
I'm sure you can.

337
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,705
Why?

338
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,900
Why does everyone want to go back?

339
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,398
[Jinqi Mountain]

340
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,846
Master, here he comes.

341
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,566
Are you looking for crimson dahlia?

342
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,584
How do you know that?

343
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:06,160
Just tell me yes or no.

344
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,467
Give it to me.

345
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,060
You're my uncle-in-law's son.

346
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,160
How can I trust you?

347
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,604
What if you want to hurt my brother?

348
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:19,261
What's this?

349
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,360
Can you trust me now?

350
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,594
I can give it to you. But you have to take me with you.

351
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:22,560
You said you'd keep me and my brother together forever.

352
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,117
Neither of you are leaving today.

353
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,552
Qing.

354
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:01,204
Come here.

355
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,363
If you keep this up,
you will get a lot of people killed.

356
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,220
My mom has been dead for so long.

357
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,960
You can't see her in anybody.

358
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,820
Huai'en.

359
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
I put up with you for your mother's sake.

360
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,700
Don't push your luck.

361
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,800
Qing.

362
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,631
Am I treating you badly?

363
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,680
Why do you want to leave?

364
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,226
You are kind to me.

365
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,912
But I want to see my brother.

366
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,760
He's not your brother.

367
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,740
Your brother is Xue Lianyu.

368
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,680
Your family was killed by Jin Bao.

369
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,640
You're defending Jin Bao's son.

370
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,280
Your parents would turn over in their graves if they knew it.

371
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't want to hear that. I want to go home.

372
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,880
Qing.

373
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,428
You're too young to tell right from wrong.

374
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,049
I did this for your own good.

375
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,760
Tong Sect is your home.

376
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,540
You'll see when you grow up.

377
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,640
- Lord. 
- I am no longer your lord.

378
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,220
Since you have returned to Tong Sect,

379
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,909
you can't leave here.

380
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,057
Nonsense.

381
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,539
It's easy for me to kill you.

382
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,020
Why are you so stubborn?

383
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,580
No.

384
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,526
I have to get back to him.

385
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:22,780
You don't have a chance anymore. But I do.

386
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,500
Since I can't use you,

387
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:33,462
there's no point for you to live.

388
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,240
Go to heaven to be with your mother.

389
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,620
Either I take her away, or I kill her now.

390
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,060
If you kill her, you won't leave here alive.

391
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,431
If I die here, she will, too.

392
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Let her go. I'll let you go.

393
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,540
No.

394
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,760
Either I take her away, or she dies.

395
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,940
Bastard.

396
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,726
Protect the box.

397
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,026
Master.

398
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,260
- Chase them. 
- Yes.

399
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
[Jinqi Mountain]

400
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,884
Go.

401
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:32,417
Go.

402
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,690
Go.

403
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,230
Go.

404
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,670
Go.

405
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,710
Xiaobao.

406
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,788
Wait for me.

407
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,374
Go.

408
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,184
- Stop. 
- Stop.

409
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,926
Lord. Are you okay?

410
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:03,282
Go.

411
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:06,430
- Go. 
- Go.

412
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,510
(text)

413
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,610
-Go. 
- Go.

414
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,330
Stop.

415
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,430
Master. We are out of Jinqi Mountain.

416
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,760
We can't chase them anymore.

417
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,830
Go.

418
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,610
- Go. 
- Go.

419
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,210
Go.

420
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:26,758
Go.

421
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,344
Go.

422
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,910
Go.

423
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,470
Go.

424
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,672
Go.

425
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,110
Go.

426
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,297
- Shoot. 
- Stop.

427
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,595
Go.

428
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,330
Go. Go.

429
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,030
Go. Go.

430
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,010
Stop.

431
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,150
Stop.

432
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,067
Brother, we meet again.

433
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,255
Stop looking.

434
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:47,970
The mountain is surrounded by my people.

435
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,770
You're out of Jinqi Mountain. There's no miasma to cover you.

436
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,333
You are outnumbered.

437
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,470
Why don't you just give up?

438
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,190
Otherwise, I'll fight you.

439
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,470
It doesn't look good.

440
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,844
Uncle, don't talk nonsense with them.

441
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:06,404
Kill them

442
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,221
to tie up loose ends.

443
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,027
Leave here.

444
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,070
Go.

445
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,709
Go.

446
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,735
Li Gongxiang, do you want to rebel?

447
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,795
Brother,

448
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,010
do you remember what I taught you the first time you went to war?

449
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:13,563
Don't trust anyone in the war.

450
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,303
Since the day you joined forces
with the Su family

451
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:23,790
and wanted to use Huai'en and Qing to lure me out,

452
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,770
I've known all your plans.

453
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,979
It's just Xue Lianqing.

454
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,001
She's worth less than you.

455
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,521
And she's worth less than the crown prince.

456
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,060
Li Gongxiang, I am the crown prince of the Zongzheng's reign.

457
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,294
If you hurt me, your whole family will be sentenced to death.

458
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,490
He doesn't have a family.

459
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,189
The Li family was loyal.

460
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:08,090
They guarded the border for decades.

461
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,633
And they were loyal.

462
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:16,394
But my brother, who walks on a moral plane,

463
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:21,710
killed them all for imperial power.

464
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,672
Li Gongxiang,

465
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,129
your brother had command over
the military at the border.

466
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:29,768
He wanted to make himself king.

467
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:33,679
People at the border suffered.

468
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,930
Didn't you apply yourself
to quell the rebellion?

469
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,590
Because that was the only way he could survive.

470
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,550
It's called

471
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,150
"a wise man knows what's good for him."

472
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,660
- Master. 
- Stay back.

473
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,280
Master.

474
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:58,443
Brother,

475
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,092
I won't forget

476
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:04,910
what you taught me.

477
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,700
Li Gongxiang, our master trusts you.

478
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,140
Why did you betray him?

479
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,940
Zongzheng Yuzhan,

480
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,540
you and I have known each other
for nearly 40 years,

481
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,980
but you never trusted me.

482
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,800
You didn't trust me before, and you don't trust me now.

483
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,340
You never let people stand behind you.

484
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,539
It's because you're wearing
the precious gold-silk soft armor.

485
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,600
Its only breakthrough

486
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
is in your back.

487
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,073
Don't you want

488
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,895
to avenge Tongen?

489
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:47,988
Yes, I do.

490
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,452
I want to avenge her.

491
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:54,186
But the man who killed her

492
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,268
was Zongzheng Yunlian.

493
00:40:56,268 --> 00:40:59,029
You killed her.

494
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:03,533
From ancient times, a woman's chastity was the most important.

495
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,520
You knew she couldn't help herself.

496
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,030
But you showed affection to her.

497
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,519
And you wanted to win the country for her.

498
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:13,684
All the officials were shocked,

499
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:17,741
called her a temptress, and accused her
of being a scourge of the country.

500
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,998
You wanted to spend
the rest of your life with her for your own desires.

501
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:25,100
Did you ask her?

502
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,632
Was she willing
to give up the lives of more than 400 people

503
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:31,100
of the Xue family for you?

504
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,578
Was she willing to give up her child

505
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,460
to commit this heinous sin with you?

506
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:42,685
It wasn't the queen who killed her.

507
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:47,344
It was you, Zongzheng Yuzhan, who killed her.

508
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:49,954
Zongzheng Yunlian took her from me.

509
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:51,460
You…

510
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:56,003
You are incorrigible.

511
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,820
Hey.

512
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,671
Hey.

513
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:19,032
Are you awake?

514
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:22,618
Hey.

515
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:24,243
We're in Annan.

516
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,360
Are you awake?

517
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:29,460
Are you all right?

518
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,110
Are you awake?

519
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,620
Go.

520
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,844
Go.

521
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:48,700
Go.

522
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,080
Mr. Su, Zhaocai.

523
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,900
Go. Here.

524
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,700
Here.

525
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,021
Stop.

526
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:57,721
Xiaoyu.

527
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:10,312
Be careful.

528
00:43:10,312 --> 00:43:11,887
Mr. Su.

529
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:14,846
Here's the crimson dahlia you asked me to find.

530
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,360
I've kept it very well.

531
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,920
Good, Xiaoyu.

532
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,060
Xiaoyu. Go to Zhaocai first.

533
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,640
Okay.

534
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,229
That's it.

535
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,838
Xiaobao asked me to tell you

536
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,637
that he doesn't want
to have anything to do with you anymore,

537
00:43:48,637 --> 00:43:51,033
and he doesn't want to see you anymore.

538
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:55,966
You don't believe me?

539
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,925
Xiaobao asked me to give this to you.

540
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,540
By the way,

541
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,162
I want to thank you for two things.

542
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:22,053
First, you lured Zongzheng Yuzhan out of Tong Sect.

543
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:25,380
If Prince Shen kills him,

544
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,226
you can get the credit.

545
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:31,540
Second, thank you for bringing Xiaoyu out.

546
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,501
In a couple of years, Xiaoyu will be old enough to get married.

547
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:39,300
It would be great

548
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,557
if she could marry Xiaobao.

549
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,880
If you knew in the afterlife

550
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,800
that Xiaobao had a large family

551
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,561
and lived a happy life,

552
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:50,061
you should be happy for him.

553
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:59,138
Enjoy the last few hours of your life.

554
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,120
What about him, Mr. Su?

555
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,700
Leave him alone.

556
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,480
He made your brother suffer and separated you.

557
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,000
He deserves it.

558
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,880
But he saved me.

559
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,840
I think he's a good man.

560
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,080
That's it.

561
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,620
Go.

562
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:44,815
Go.

563
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,200
Go.

564
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,040
Go.

565
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,200
Go.

566
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,420
Go.

567
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,360
Xiaobao.

568
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,740
You won't give me a chance.

569
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,660
I like you.

570
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,612
Is it nice?

571
00:46:02,612 --> 00:46:04,469
Your bark is worse than your bite.

572
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:07,154
First of all, don't push me away.

573
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:12,135
Ever since I met you, I've only loved you.

574
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:24,407
Do you want to kill me?

575
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,862
You must take care of yourself.

576
00:46:29,862 --> 00:46:32,337
I will forgive you.

577
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,100
I was born with sin.

578
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:40,335
I don't deserve all the good things
in the world.

579
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,120
The more I want you,

580
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:48,065
the faster I lose you.
