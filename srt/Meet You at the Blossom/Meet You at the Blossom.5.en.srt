1
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:45,967
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:47,027
Who is there?

3
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:47,827
Come out.

4
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,707
So much for the son of that man.

5
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:05,707
He was making out with a man here.

6
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:06,507
Hey.

7
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:08,787
You brat.

8
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,027
Why are you scolding him for no reason

9
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:11,747
instead of sucking your mother's milk?

10
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:15,747
Look at your creepy eyes.

11
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,947
You must be a weasel.

12
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:19,067
How dare you…

13
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,347
How dare you be rude to me?

14
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:24,187
I'll cut you into pieces
and execute your whole family.

15
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,147
Knock it off.

16
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:32,117
I don't want to argue with you.

17
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:34,107
Hand over the stuff.

18
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:37,023
I'll consider leaving you a whole body.

19
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,740
I don't have it.

20
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,700
What is it?

21
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,627
Don't play dumb.

22
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,467
This is the only way to Jinqi Mountain.

23
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,427
You said you were going to Yuxia.

24
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:50,707
But, in fact,

25
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,147
you were going to send it
back to Jinqi Mountain.

26
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:57,107
My uncle had known it.

27
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,427
He had us waiting here a long time ago.

28
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:00,667
Today,

29
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,987
if you don't hand over the stuff,

30
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,747
you won't leave this place alive.

31
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,027
Not to mention you're with a useless person.

32
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:14,570
Step back!

33
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:33,936
Huai'en.

34
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:49,147
Xiaobao, step back! Don't be silly.

35
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,827
Huai'en, don't worry about me.
Leave here.

36
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,043
You can run faster without me.

37
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:52,587
Nonsense.

38
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:00,507
Then, look.

39
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,867
It's also a form of liking.

40
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:12,307
Stop.

41
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:19,027
Let us go.

42
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,267
I'll give it to you.

43
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,747
Do you think you have a choice?

44
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,387
If you don't give us a way out,

45
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,747
you won't get anything.

46
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:29,767
Let's go.

47
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,387
Chase them.

48
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,667
Your Highness, we've got the stuff.

49
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,507
Don't chase them.

50
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:52,347
Huai'en.

51
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,267
Run.

52
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,187
I won't leave you alone.

53
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,007
Let's go.

54
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:05,907
Lord.

55
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,107
Lord. Sorry we're late.

56
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:15,860
Were you scared?

57
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:17,827
I…

58
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,227
I've seen this before.

59
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:20,147
I was not scared.

60
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,827
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

61
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,147
Young Master, how are you?

62
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,187
Are you hurt?

63
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,027
It's all right.

64
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,267
I'm fine.

65
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,387
What are you two doing here?

66
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:34,827
Young master,
if you run away from home again,

67
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,987
I'm begging you, please kill us first.

68
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,187
I didn't run away from home.

69
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,827
I had something serious to do.

70
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:45,547
Come on. Don't cry. It's embarrassing.

71
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,587
Okay, I'll stop crying.

72
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,027
Young master, please come back with us.

73
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:53,107
The carriage is ready at the
foot of the mountain. Let's go.

74
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,267
I don't want to go back.

75
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:55,507
I have to find the miracle doctor.

76
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,187
The master has sent someone else.

77
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,227
Please come back with us first.

78
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,427
The master wanted you
to go back no matter what.

79
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,347
Come on.

80
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,467
You don't know.

81
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,067
The miracle doctor is eccentric.

82
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,227
If I don't go in person,

83
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:05,947
he may not be willing to come.

84
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:06,627
Young master.

85
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,907
The master wanted us to get you back
even if we had to tie you up.

86
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:09,307
Ah, young master.

87
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,307
Please come with me first.

88
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,147
I have something to say to you.

89
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:12,987
What do you want to say?

90
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:13,627
Let's go.

91
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:14,707
Hey.

92
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,547
Apply the medicine.

93
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:16,787
I'll wait for you
at the foot of the mountain.

94
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:18,993
- Let's go, young master.
- Come on.

95
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,290
Come on, young master.

96
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,827
Just say it.

97
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:33,627
Don't be sneaky.

98
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:37,427
Young master,

99
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:40,027
the master said
something was wrong with Mr. Huai'en.

100
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:43,867
And we had a lot of trouble on the way here.

101
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,507
I'm afraid he's up to something.

102
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:52,507
Don't play dumb.

103
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,627
This is the only way to Jinqi Mountain.

104
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,147
You said you were going to Yuxia.

105
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,187
But, in fact,

106
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,107
you wanted to send it back to Jinqi Mountain.

107
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,227
He's just an armed escort.

108
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,507
What could he be up to?

109
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,907
He must have been coerced by his father.

110
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,307
I knew all of this.

111
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,347
I asked them to secretly stop you.

112
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:14,147
I didn't want you to follow me.

113
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,187
You are my father's men now.

114
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,147
You're not my men anymore.

115
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,827
No, young master.

116
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,867
We are your men.

117
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,427
Young master, please stop talking about that.

118
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,107
Please come back with us.

119
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,787
I'm afraid he'll do something bad to you.

120
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:28,907
Come on.

121
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,747
How could he do anything bad to me?

122
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,267
I'm warning you.

123
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,387
No more nonsense.

124
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,227
You don't know.

125
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,707
Huai'en and I love each other,

126
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,747
and we are together in life and death.

127
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:44,387
He's willing

128
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:46,147
to give up his life for me.

129
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,907
And he gave up something
more important than his life.

130
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,547
I see.

131
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,267
Those people must have been sent
by Prince Shen.

132
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,467
It's over.

133
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,627
What if his father knew?

134
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:00,867
He'll beat him hard.

135
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:03,987
Young master.

136
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:05,467
Are you confused?

137
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,427
Huai'en is cold as ice.

138
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,267
He fights desperately.

139
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,747
Just like a desperado,
he wants his opponents dead.

140
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:15,387
How could he

141
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,347
love you?

142
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,427
He's right.

143
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:19,507
What do you know?

144
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,747
He has a rough life.

145
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:23,827
His mother died young.

146
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:24,987
His father is cold.

147
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,707
Nobody ever loved him.

148
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,307
And he doesn't know how to love himself.

149
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:30,827
It's over.

150
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,387
What should I do now?

151
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,347
If his father knew

152
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,907
he gave up something more important
than his life for me,

153
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,507
his father would beat him to death.

154
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,627
However, young master,

155
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,707
have you forgotten

156
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,187
the girl in the Yicui House,

157
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:45,867
Mr. Wang's niece,

158
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:46,987
and Mrs. Wang's daughter?

159
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,427
Aren't you in love with them, too?

160
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,987
How can they compare to Huai'en?

161
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,907
Just so you know,

162
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,307
from today on,

163
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,456
I only love Huai'en.

164
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,747
Don't ever mention

165
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,627
Mr. Wang's daughter

166
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,667
and other girls again.

167
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:08,187
If Huai'en finds out,

168
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,387
I won't spare you.

169
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,387
I've been navigating
the world of romance for years.

170
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,427
But I've never met anyone like Huai'en

171
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,067
who worries me a lot.

172
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,707
Say something.

173
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:20,667
Before,

174
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,747
I just wanted to conquer him.

175
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:23,867
But now,

176
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,667
I want to protect him.

177
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,707
He's like my destined person,
as the story says.

178
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:48,427
Go.

179
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:53,707
Go.

180
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,636
Does it still hurt?

181
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,227
It's not a big deal.
I'm fine.

182
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,823
It's not a big deal?

183
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,621
How could you fight them like that?

184
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,101
You stood there and let them beat you.

185
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,070
You fought back only when you were injured.

186
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,088
When you are outnumbered, strategize first.

187
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,221
Out?

188
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,667
I don't want to be left out.

189
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
Well…

190
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:26,387
Were those people sent by Prince Shen?

191
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,153
Did you give them

192
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,400
what your father wanted?

193
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,587
I knew it.

194
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:40,867
What is that stuff?

195
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,147
Does your father have to get it?

196
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,507
Can I trade gold for it with your father?

197
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:47,747
As long as he doesn't beat you,

198
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,707
I'll give him as much gold as he wants.

199
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,867
Don't worry about it.

200
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,387
I can handle it.

201
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,707
How can I not worry?

202
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:58,187
Look at how badly you're hurt.

203
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:01,787
Well…

204
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:06,227
Did you go to Jinqi Mountain
to send the booklet,

205
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,034
not to send me to Yuxia?

206
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:12,147
Couldn't it

207
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,467
be both?

208
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,907
It could. I knew you wouldn't lie to me.

209
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:27,467
It's just that
I didn't expect you to learn so fast.

210
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:29,107
What?

211
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,453
Learn how to love.

212
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,467
You would give up your life for me.

213
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,427
It shows that you love me.

214
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,027
My parents did the same thing.

215
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:40,987
What?

216
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,907
My mother died trying to save my father.

217
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,107
After my mother died,

218
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,747
my father has been undesirous

219
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,707
and has never been in love with anyone else.

220
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:51,387
So,

221
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,947
I won't let you die to save me.

222
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,707
In this life,

223
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,227
I'll do anything to protect you.

224
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:04,621
Me too.

225
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,528
I'll also protect you

226
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,187
and never let you suffer.

227
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:07,987
Do you mean it?

228
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:09,607
Of course.

229
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,787
The word of a gentleman
is as good as his bond.

230
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:14,187
Even when you are old,

231
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,187
I won't change my love for you.

232
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:17,510
Then,

233
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,307
don't go back on your word

234
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,707
no matter what happens.

235
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,307
I promise.

236
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,427
If you lie to me,

237
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:32,854
I will never leave you alone.

238
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,621
I promise I won't lie to you.

239
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,707
I swear.

240
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:27,667
Zongzheng Huai'en.

241
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,263
Master,

242
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,307
here's the roster.

243
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,627
Master,

244
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:53,490
Zhang Chunxin reported

245
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,387
that the young master had a good relationship
with Jin's son.

246
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,720
Are they…

247
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:07,987
Gao,

248
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,187
are paper kites

249
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,347
conscious?

250
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,903
I like paper kites.

251
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,907
They do

252
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,596
what I tell them to do.

253
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,163
No matter how high and how far they fly,

254
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,267
I'm always in control of the strings.

255
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,907
If I let it go east,

256
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,827
it won't go west.

257
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:51,787
If I shut its gate of life,

258
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,907
it will perish.

259
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,627
Inform Li Gongxiang

260
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,267
that we got the roster

261
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,347
and ask him

262
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,907
to kill everyone in Jin's family.

263
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,107
Yes.

264
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,877
Dad.

265
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:39,877
Mom.

266
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:50,727
Zhuang.

267
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,827
Dad, what are you doing?

268
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:07,685
Mom.

269
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:08,427
Mom.

270
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,960
Help me.

271
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,892
Huai'en.

272
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:11,692
Huai'en.

273
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:32,250
Get on your knees.

274
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:34,907
Dad.

275
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:38,867
Get on your knees.

276
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,828
You are not allowed to get up

277
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,569
until you realize you're wrong.

278
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,427
All you do is scold me.

279
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:54,467
Mr. Huai'en, you have been recuperating
at my house for days,

280
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,107
but I haven't treated you well.

281
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:59,347
Please excuse me.

282
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:01,547
It's all right.

283
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,187
I'm vulgar.

284
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,227
I don't know how to mince my words.

285
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:14,756
Let me get this straight.

286
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:15,907
Mr. Huai'en,

287
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,947
since you're healed,

288
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,107
why don't you go home?

289
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,907
Xiaobao is naughty and childish

290
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,987
by nature.

291
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:31,907
He changes his mind easily.

292
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,627
You don't seem uneducated.

293
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,107
Why are you fooling around with him?

294
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,107
Well.

295
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:44,627
I don't think you know much about Xiaobao.

296
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:46,067
Xiaobao

297
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,816
was spoiled as a child.

298
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,935
He's a three-minute passion person.

299
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:52,827
He rushes into things and forgets them soon.

300
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:55,888
I think it won't be long

301
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:57,576
before Xiaobao

302
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,267
forgets your name.

303
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,203
You're an imposing man.

304
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,027
Why are you selling yourself?

305
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:08,788
Master, something went wrong.

306
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,223
The young lady is missing.

307
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,956
Miss.

308
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:22,747
Zhuang.

309
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:23,707
Master.

310
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:24,716
Master.

311
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:25,723
What happened?

312
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:28,141
The maid thought
the young lady was in the room.

313
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,215
But she found the young lady was missing

314
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,963
when she went to tell her
that the young master had come back.

315
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,052
She kept talking
about finding the young master.

316
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,650
She should have disappeared
before the young master returned.

317
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,043
Miss!

318
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,966
Zhuang, ask Governor Wu to seal all city gates.

319
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:43,850
Go.

320
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Yes.

321
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,846
Xiaobao.

322
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:13,893
Xiaobao.

323
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,840
Xiaobao, what should we do?

324
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,920
- Xiaobao.
- What's wrong, mom?

325
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Your sister is missing, Xiaobao.

326
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,053
What?

327
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,600
Let's go.

328
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,880
Master.

329
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,400
Dear.

330
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,080
Well…

331
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,040
It will be all right.

332
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,400
Hi. Have you seen a little girl
this tall?

333
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,040
No.

334
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Thank you.

335
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,960
Have you seen a little girl

336
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,560
this tall?

337
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
Hi. Have you seen a little girl this tall?

338
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,120
Thank you.

339
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
Xiaoyu.

340
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,480
Young lady.

341
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,960
Hi. Have you seen a little girl this tall?

342
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
Thank you.

343
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
Have a look.

344
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,013
Zhaocai, Jinbao,

345
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:07,720
split up and look around.

346
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,362
Yes.

347
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,800
You two, come with me.

348
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Yes.

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
Flowers.

350
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,160
Beautiful flowers.

351
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,120
A young lady is missing?

352
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,753
How could this happen?

353
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:23,400
What does it say?

354
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
A young lady is missing.

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh.

356
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
It shouldn't have happened.

357
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,720
That's the young lady.

358
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,207
Have you seen the young lady?

359
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,240
Who has seen the young lady?

360
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,843
Master.

361
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,738
Master.

362
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:57,925
Zhuang.

363
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,704
Last night, the doctor came to see you.

364
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:02,040
The young lady hid in his carriage
and was taken out.

365
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,131
So, she avoided the inspection of the mansion.

366
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:07,250
Someone saw the young lady
jumping out of the carriage in Pinglu Lane.

367
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,120
No one has seen her since.

368
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,628
Zhuang, send more people
to search house to house.

369
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:13,760
- Go.
- No need.

370
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,713
I've looked it up.

371
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,239
She was taken away by Qi Xiaobin,
the son of the county official

372
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,253
of Yunyang county of Huaizhou.

373
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,985
It's him.

374
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,755
Why did he take Xiaoyu?

375
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:28,320
If he had a grudge against us,
he could have come at me.

376
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,956
Zhaocai, Jinbao,
come with me to Yunyang County to save her.

377
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:32,600
Yes.

378
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,518
Xiaoyu.

379
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,125
Brother.

380
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,330
Brother, you are finally back.

381
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,646
Xiaoyu, are you all right?

382
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:13,526
I'm all right.

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,880
Qi Xiaobin, why did you take my sister?

384
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,695
You wronged me.

385
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:23,483
She was taken away by a trafficker.
But I ran into her

386
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:24,470
and saved her.

387
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,620
I didn't know she was the young lady
of the Jin family until I asked her.

388
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,240
So,

389
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
I brought her back to you.

390
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,440
Would you be so kind?

391
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,525
The past is gone for good.

392
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,170
I've left it behind.

393
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,940
However, the Jin family is rich.

394
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,880
Even if I want to harm you,

395
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,820
I don't dare to.

396
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,200
If you don't believe me,

397
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
you can ask your sister.

398
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,160
Xiaoyu.

399
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
Xiaoyu.

400
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,440
Xiaoyu.

401
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,380

Mom.

402
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,200
Come here.

403
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
Come here.

404
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,375
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

405
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,700
She's all right.

406
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,000
Let's go.

407
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,700
Xiaoyu, are you sure you're all right?

408
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,520
I'm sure.

409
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,965
Thanks for today.

410
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,320
What's your problem with Qi Xiaobin?

411
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,600
I'll tell you

412
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,280
if you promise not to get mad.

413
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:14,218
Here is the thing.

414
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:17,899
[Yicui House]

415
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,640
Five years ago, I was out playing.

416
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,520
Help.

417
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,040
I saw him beating a girl.

418
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,680
The girl was not well-dressed.

419
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,600
Please, Mr. Qi.

420
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,125
And she was beaten badly.

421
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,530
Even the house owner dared not to come forward.

422
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,618
I couldn't bear it.

423
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:34,840
So, I rescued the girl.

424
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,058
Don't you know how to serve people?

425
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:37,410
Stop.

426
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,480
You're supposed to take care of women,

427
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
not beat them.

428
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,040
Miss, are you all right?

429
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,000
- I'm all right.
- Careful.

430
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,880
It's all right.

431
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Thank you, sir.

432
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,740
You're nosy.

433
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,600
Be careful.

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,720
His leg has been disabled ever since.

435
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,720
Later, my family
compensated him with a lot of money.

436
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,680
And Su Yin pulled some strings
to get his father a promotion.

437
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
So, they didn't pursue it any further.

438
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,905
You fought against him for a prostitute.

439
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,000
That was your style.

440
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,000
A hero is silent about his past glories.

441
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,520
Are you using the right word?

442
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Of course.

443
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,460
Miss, take a look at the flowers.

444
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,520
This flower is nice.

445
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,200
Yeah.

446
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,160
Go.

447
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:00,120
Go.

448
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:02,840
Go.

449
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,090
Young master,

450
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,573
we've been planning this for a long time.

451
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:15,933
We finally caught her.

452
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,453
Why didn't we just kill her

453
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:18,829
and make the Jin family miserable?

454
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:19,940
Nonsense.

455
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,240
What do you know?

456
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,180
The Jin family

457
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,160
has hidden their daughter for so long.

458
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,945
Don't you think she looks like someone?

459
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Who's that?

460
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,083
Xue Lianyu.

461
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,940
Xue Lianyu?

462
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,960
The Imperial Court tried hard

463
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,080
to get to the bottom
of the Xue family's deaths.

464
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,680
But they didn't have a clue.

465
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:55,520
Now, the Jin family has been hiding
the daughter of the Xue family.

466
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,140
The Xue family's deaths

467
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,280
must have something to do with the Jin family.

As an adult,

00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,895
Grandpa.

566
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,680
Does the Furun Chamber of Commerce

567
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,880
have anything to do with Zongzheng Yuzhan?

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
Why are you asking this?

569
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,880
I found out a man

570
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,193
who's been investigating
the Furun Chamber of Commerce.

571
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:34,840
He looked like the child

572
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,940
Princess Xue had given birth to
at the risk of death.

573
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,248
I suspected he was Zongzheng Yuzhan's spy.

574
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:44,275
So, I didn't act rashly.

575
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,840
I was afraid it would involve many people.

576
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,050
I think it has something to do
with Zongzheng Yuzhan.

577
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,320
That person who stayed in the Jin family

578
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,880
is the key to capturing the second prince.

579
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,280
I've ordered someone to keep an eye on him.

580
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,888
I'll go back to the Jin family

581
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,320
to capture him alive now.

582
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,160
Report.

583
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,533
Prince, Your Highness.

584
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,829
There is a plague outbreak in Yuxia.

585
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,600
What?

586
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,640
Many people died.

587
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,768
Local officials have been covering it up.

588
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:16,053
His Majesty was furious.

589
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,080
So, His Majesty designated His Highness
as an imperial envoy

590
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,640
to go to Yuxia
to relieve the people in disaster.

591
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,635
The imperial order is not to be disobeyed.

592
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:22,880
It matters to the people.

593
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,520
But…

594
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
What about the Jin family?

595
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,800
Send a message to Jin Bao.

596
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,724
Yes.

597
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:31,120
What? Plague?

598
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,673
The person sent to look
for the miracle doctor can't come back.

599
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:35,705
What about my father?

600
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:38,720
Come on.

601
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Go get Dr. Li.

602
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,720
Yes.

603
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,568
Come on.

604
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,040
You have to treat him

605
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,746
anyway.

606
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:50,525
I…

607
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,693
I can't do anything about it.

608
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,320
Why didn't you say you couldn't treat him

609
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,950
when you took the money?

610
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,380
Stridor is hard to treat.

611
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,040
Mr. Jin has been ill for a long time,

612
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,303
and he works hard every day.

613
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:06,405
It was inevitable that he would get worse.

614
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,560
But you're a doctor.

615
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,800
Think of a way.

616
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:11,640
Let me think about it.

617
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,440
It's an emergency.

618
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,980
I remember.

619
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,915
The Liu family in the west of the city
has an ancestral secret prescription

620
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,040
that is very effective
in treating this disease.

621
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,340
I think you have a good relationship
with Liu's son.

622
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,280
Why don't you go to them?

623
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:33,800
Liu family?

624
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
Yes.

625
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:40,228
Hurry up.

626
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,480
Young master,
shall we go directly to the Liu's?

627
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:42,920
No.

628
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,760
We're going to Yicui House.

629
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,680
Yicui House?

630
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,360
You scared me.

631
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,720
Young master, what a coincidence.

632
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,370
This is the soup that Mrs. Jin made for you.

633
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,240
Forget it.

634
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,840
Put it in my room.

635
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,680
I'll drink it when I get back.

636
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,480
Where are you going?

637
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,040
Yicui House.

638
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,440
Yicui House.

639
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,680
You've finally figured it out.

640
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,320
Zhaocai, come on.

641
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,020
Mr. Liu,

642
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,120
you're finally here.

643
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,193
Liu.

644
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:11,760
Long time no see.

645
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
I knew I'd run into you here.

646
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Go in there.

647
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,200
Liu.

648
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I came here to…

649
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Let's go.

650
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
Please go inside and talk.

651
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,240
The girls in Yicui House missed you a lot

652
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
these days.

653
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,960
Xiaobao.

654
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,520
Excuse me.

655
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,080
Excuse me.

656
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,104
Where's Xiaobao?

657
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,160
Our young master went to Yicui House.

658
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,420
Yicui House

659
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,020
is the most famous brothel in Huaizhou.

660
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,080
You?

661
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,360
Don't think
that our young master is exclusive to you.

662
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,700
Our young master's confidantes

663
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,540
are all over the four provinces of Jiangnan.

664
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,540
There are more than 800 girls
in the Yicui House.

665
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,200
They would do anything for our young master.

666
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
And…

667
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,400
That's it.

668
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:30,319
I'll drink tea instead of wine.

669
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:31,360
Cheers.

670
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,560
Zhao Cai.

671
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,880
Your young master
hasn't been here for a long time.

672
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
Yeah.

673
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,640
Well.

674
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,840
Our young master is going straight.

675
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,680
He met a new sweetheart.

676
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,400
So, he would come here less.

677
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,100
Our master said

678
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,350
he would hold a wedding for him soon.

679
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,554
We'll share the joy.

680
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:52,200
So, we came here less.

681
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,698
He's here to talk about something important.

682
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,035
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come.

683
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:56,880
Come on.

684
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
Enjoy yourselves.

685
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,102
Jin.

686
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:00,938
Liu.

687
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:01,780
Zhang.

688
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,960
Chen.

689
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,720
Good.

690
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,320
You're as cheerful as ever.

691
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,193
I'll get the secret prescription for you.

692
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:15,980
I'll ask my man to send it to your mansion.

693
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,513
Thank you so much, Liu.

694
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,508
Guys, enjoy yourselves

695
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,760
and have fun.

696
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,231
Tonight is my treat.

697
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:25,555
Great.

698
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,000
Liu,

699
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,740
excuse me, I have to go.

700
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,040
What's the rush?

701
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,300
The new girls haven't arrived yet.

702
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,560
Mrs. Guo.

703
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,190
Where are the girls?

704
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,160
Coming.

705
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,560
Where did you go?

706
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,840
Coming.

707
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,480
Mr. Jin can't wait.

708
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,600
Yeah.

709
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,360
Liu,

710
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,200
actually…

711
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
This is Ms. Sisi.

712
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,261
Mr. Jin.

713
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:48,760
Good.

714
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,357
Take good care of Mr. Jin tonight.

715
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:53,280
All right.

716
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,400
Mr. Jin,

717
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,480
please take a seat.

718
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,080
Sit down, Jin.

719
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,080
Taste it, sir.

720
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,800
Liu.

721
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,600
Don't worry.

722
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,040
Take good care of Mr. Jin.

723
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
Let me pour you wine.

724
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,969
[Yicui House]

725
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,880
What happened?

726
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:24,450
Run.

727
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,440
Hurry.

728
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,400
Murder.

729
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,080
You did a good job.

730
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:40,920
Let me wipe it for you.

731
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Sisi, right?

732
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,080
Another drink.

733
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,320
Don't worry, sir.

734
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
Sir.

735
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,080
What's your name?

736
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,360
My name is Xiaohua.

737
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Xiaohua.

738
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,275
Here.

739
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,173
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

740
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,471
Mr. Jin, that's very sweet of you.

741
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:59,040
Mr. Jin,

742
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
have another drink.

743
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,200
Xiaobao.
