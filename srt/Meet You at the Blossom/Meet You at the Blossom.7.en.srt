1
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,729
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,720
Dad.

3
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,960
Mom.

4
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,120
Brother.

5
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,300
Brother.

6
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,600
Brother.

7
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Brother.

8
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
On what charges did the Imperial Court
confiscate the Jin family's property?

9
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,010
Trafficking illegal salt.

10
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,880
Illegal mining.

11
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,880
Is that true?

12
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,900
Yes.

13
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,800
Your Highness,

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,020
Jin Bao is really cunning.

15
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,160
He never told you the truth.

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
We always thought that the Jin family
ran a legitimate business.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,160
It's not the time for that.

18
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
We should do something to save them.

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,520
Your Highness,

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
We'll be sentenced to death.

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
Why do you want to get involved?

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I can't give up on Xiaobao.

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,340
I'm not a Xue.

24
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm a Jin.

25
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,500
I want to see my parents.

26
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,900
I want to see my brother.

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,760
Miss, you're a Xue.

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,716
I don't know anyone from the Xue family.

29
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,920
It's because you were injured

30
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,160
and lost your previous memories.

31
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
How is that possible?

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
- Miss, it's true.
- I'm not.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,023
- Miss, don't cry.
- I'm not.

34
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,180
Are you done?

35
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:43,400
You can live if you're Xue Lianqing.

36
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,243
You will die if you are Jin Xiaoyu.

37
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,839
It's your decision.

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,960
Just go back with me.

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
Once I get everything settled,

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
I will take Xiaobao

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
and your parents there.

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,380
Then,

43
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,720
you can reunite as a family.

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
And…

45
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,433
you will never be separated.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
It's fate.

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
It's all fate.

48
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,580
Dad.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
It's not fate.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
It's my fault.

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
I was stupid and ignorant.

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,940
I belittled myself,

53
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,440
invited a dangerous man to our home,

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
and didn't listen to you.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,183
I was thoughtless.

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Dad.

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,480
Mom.

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,636
It's all my fault.

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,640
I hurt our family.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
No, Xiaobao.

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
It's all our fault.

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,180
We were too greedy

63
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,720
to get where we are today.

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
Xiaobao, I prepared something for you.

65
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,280
Look.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Wear it.

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
I'll clean it.

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,220
Mom.

69
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,920
I'll clean it.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,600
Mom.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,680
Today is the day you come of age.

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,720
I prepared a lot of gifts for you.

73
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,960
Xiaobao.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Mom.

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,160
It's touching.

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
Young Master Jin,

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,480
how are you doing?

79
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,160
Go.

80
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
What do you want?

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,640
What do you want?

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Let him go.

83
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Get away.

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Stop it.

85
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,480
Master.

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,620
Don't hurt my parents.

87
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll go with you.

88
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,906
Xiaobao.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,100
Don't hurt my son.

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,140
Xiaobao.

91
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,800
Let him go. Xiaobao.

92
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
Master. Xiaobao.

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,880
Xiaobao.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Well…

95
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Young Master Jin.

96
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,200
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this day?

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,760
I've been thinking

98
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,820
all the time

99
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,100
that you would be in my hand someday.

100
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,660
I've thought of thousands of ways to treat you.

101
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
What do you want?

102
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
I want to give you a farewell gift.

103
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,520
What is that?

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
What is that?

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,440
Young Master Jin.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,580
It's the Wangu Poison Needle
I tailored for you,

107
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,520
which is made
from forty-eight kinds of deadly poisons.

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't do that.

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,040
As long as I inject it into your body,

110
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,560
you'll feel like
you're being bitten by countless ants,

111
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
and you will wish you were dead.

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,670
Xiaobin, kill me if you dare.

113
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
You can't stand it?

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,300
The most painful part

115
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,880
of the Wangu Poison Needle is not now.

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,596
Is it comfortable?

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,960
It won't leave you any wounds at all.

118
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,520
You'll look just like a normal person.

119
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,160
But in the future, when the weather is bad,

120
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
your pain will be doubled.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,620
As the poison erodes,

122
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
you'll lose consciousness,

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
fester, and wish you were dead.

124
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,366
However,

125
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,440
it is said that no one made it that far.

126
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Most of them committed suicide.

127
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,480
My spoiled young master,

128
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
when you crippled my legs,

129
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
did you think that karma would come so quickly?

130
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,773
Scum.

131
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:27,886
Bastard.

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,160
If I die, my ghost will haunt you forever.

133
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,160
You can't handle me while you're alive.

134
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,720
What can you do after you die?

135
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,120
Three days later,

136
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,840
you will be escorted to Linjing.

137
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,560
His Majesty will oversee the execution

138
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
to warn the world.

139
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,960
The journey to the north will be difficult.

140
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,640
The weather will be cold.

141
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,340
And you will be in excruciating pain.

142
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,400
Your pain will be far greater than it is today.

143
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Jin Xiaobao,

144
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,600
enjoy it.

145
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,440
Why did you do this to me,

146
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,400
Zongzheng Huai'en?

147
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Open the door.

148
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,753
Xiaobao.

149
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,000
Xiaobao.
Don't scare me.

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,366
Xiaobao.

151
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
Xiaobao.

152
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,160
Xiaobao.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,040
Xiaobao.

154
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
I've got what you need.

155
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,840
It's unethical for a man

156
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
to fall in love with a man.

157
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,720
I can't let you go astray.

158
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Hypocritical.

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
One more thing.

160
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,480
I arranged a marriage for you

161
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,520
when you were a child.

162
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Have you forgotten?

163
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,160
But I never promised you.

164
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,200
The uncivilized tribes
married their beloved princess to you

165
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,580
to surrender to us.

166
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,280
They will surely become my assistants
in ruling the world.

167
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,500
If you really like that boy,

168
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,320
you can make him your concubine.

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,880
If you need the offspring's help,

170
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,140
why don't you marry the princess

171
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,900
and some concubines?

172
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,160
Anyway, my mother is dead.

173
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,320
Nobody will get in your way.

174
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Do you want to die?

175
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,600
You said you'd set me free
when I got the job done.

176
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,740
We haven't avenged your mother yet.

177
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,400
How can you talk about freedom?

178
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,720
Get ready

179
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,120
to marry the princess.

180
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Where am I?

181
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
Where am I?

182
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
Qing.

183
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Qing.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
You're awake.

185
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,460
It's all right.

186
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,780
Qing.

187
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,880
It's all right.

188
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,680
Let go of me.

189
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,360
I will forgive you no matter what you do wrong.

190
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,960
It's Gu poison. Open it when you need it.

191
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Jin Xiaobao.

192
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,320
Su Yin.

193
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,200
Come on, Your Highness.

194
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Your Highness,

195
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,160
we got the news that…

196
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Yes.

197
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
You get out, too.

198
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Yes.

199
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
The Jin family was taken away.

200
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,680
Since you've handed over
the Gu poison to Mr. Jin,

201
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,880
how to do it is up to Mr. Jin.

202
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,540
It was not Huai'en.

203
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,680
What?

204
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,840
The escorts were arranged by you.

205
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,040
Don't you know who took them?

206
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,360
All escorts were registered officials.

207
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,740
I just told them

208
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,640
to stick to the plan.

209
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll look into it now.

210
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,600
Please excuse me.

211
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
It's all right, Xiaobao.

212
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
It's all right.

213
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,480
Dad.

214
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
It's all right.

215
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,980
They're all fine.

216
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,340
Don't worry.

217
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,640
Don't worry.

218
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,200
What's wrong?

219
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Xiaobao.

220
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
Xiaobao.

221
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,380
Bear with it.

222
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,540
You'll be all right soon.

223
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,560
Bear with it.

224
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,140
Zhaocai.

225
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,240
Zhaocai, Jinbao.

226
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,560
Where did they go?

227
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
Come on.

228
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,760
Get up.

229
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,680
Thanks.

230
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,180
I feel much better.

231
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,860
That's great.

232
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,000
That's great.

233
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Su Yin.

234
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,280
I understand

235
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,680
why you scolded me before.

236
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm useless.

237
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,800
I was tricked,

238
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,940
but I thought he was nice.

239
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,920
Xiaobao,

240
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
I didn't mean that.

241
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,840
I won't be willful anymore.

242
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,300
Xiaobao,

243
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,880
you don't have to do this.

244
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
I have no right to be willful anymore.

245
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Really.

246
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,040
Su Yin,

247
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
I've lost my home.

248
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,196
And I

249
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,590
was poisoned.

250
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,960
I don't think I'll live long.

251
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,360
Xiaobao,

252
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,320
as long as I'm here,

253
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,880
you can still be like before.

254
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,680
Actually, I understand everything
you said before.

255
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm useless.

256
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,400
I thought I could be a young master forever

257
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
and I could be rich forever.

258
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,160
But…

259
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,480
But I never felt like I was stupid.

260
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
I just didn't think I wanted to work hard.

261
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
I was so stupid

262
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,080
to be tricked.

263
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,260
All right.

264
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,360
Xiaobao,

265
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
with his intelligence,

266
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,740
even I can't handle him,

267
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,280
let alone you.

268
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,280
You should recuperate.

269
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,560
Don't think about anything.

270
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,820
I promise

271
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,680
you'll never see him again.

272
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
I will make him disappear

273
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,360
from this world forever.

274
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,020
With his intelligence,

275
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,980
how can you deal with him?

276
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,180
Don't get yourself hurt.

277
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,280
Don't worry.

278
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,240
Take care of yourself.

279
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,700
Didn't Prince Shen say he would come back?

280
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,160
When he comes back,

281
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,760
I won't leave him alone.

282
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,520
All right.

283
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,700
Take a rest.

284
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,360
I have something to do.

285
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,760
I want to see my parents.

286
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,580
Just recuperate in peace.

287
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,960
They are well taken care of.

288
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Listen to me.

289
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,160
Jin Xiaobao

290
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,920
was taken away by Su Yin.

291
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,540
Master, do you feel better?

292
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm fine.

293
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:40,960
It's all right.

294
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,570
Dad.

295
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,500
Xiaobao.

296
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,333
You finally woke up, Dad.

297
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,160
Xiaobao, you're not hurt, are you?

298
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,240
No. I was only flogged.

299
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,560
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,560
Dear.

301
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,836
I'm sorry I made you suffer.

302
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:09,116
No.

303
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,500
It's all my fault.

304
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,520
I was too greedy.

305
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,880
It's not your fault.

306
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,200
It's my fault. I was thoughtless.

307
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
We are lucky

308
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,640
to have survived.

309
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,640
All right.

310
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,020
Let bygones he bygones.

311
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,520
We won't mention it again.

312
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,336
Su Yin said he was going to take us to Annan.

313
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,720
The three of us will start a new life.

314
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,980
Okay.

315
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,320
Young Master.

316
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,923
The five of us.

317
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,703
The five of us.

318
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,863
The five of us.

319
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,843
Okay.

320
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,140
The five of us.

321
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,120
The five of us.

322
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,960
Your Highness.

323
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,000
Your Highness.

324
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,640
Zongzheng Huai'en's men are after us.

325
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Ask Zhaocai and Jinbao

326
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,860
to arrange for people
to escort the Jin family to Annan.

327
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,960
Tell them to go now.

328
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,880
Your Highness, what about you?

329
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,720
I'm going to meet them.

330
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,920
Your Highness,

331
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,940
the prince has agreed
to cooperate with the Imperial Court.

332
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,080
But you're determined
to protect the Jin family.

333
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
That's openly opposing the Imperial Court.

334
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm afraid you can't explain it to Prince Shen.

335
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,100
Ultimately, the Imperial Court

336
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,540
just wanted to exterminate the second prince.

337
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,680
The Jin family is just a breakthrough.

338
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,640
The Imperial Court needs my help.

339
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,900
As long as Xiaobao and his family
arrive safely in Annam,

340
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,080
Prince Shen will not dare to hurt them
because of me.

341
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,560
Over time,

342
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,900
I will give Zongzheng Huai'en's head

343
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,680
to the Imperial Court

344
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,920
and ask His Majesty to pardon the Jin family.

345
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Yes.

346
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:27,425
Mr. Jin.

347
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:31,280
Be careful.

348
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,040
Thanks.

349
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Be careful.

350
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,045
Be careful, madam.

351
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:38,300
Come on.

352
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Why don't you go back with us?

353
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,320
Did the people of the Imperial Court come,

354
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
or did he come?

355
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
Will we get you into trouble?

356
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,660
What are you afraid of?

357
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,120
I've solved all the troubles you've caused

358
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,300
since you were a child.

359
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
But this is different.

360
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,900
You harbored criminals

361
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,760
and hijacked the prison wagon.

362
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,400
Nonsense.

363
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,640
I am telling you.

364
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,840
I'll only say it once.

365
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,300
Your Jin family was deceived

366
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,055
by the remnants of the mutineers.

367
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:21,480
You were always lambs to the slaughter.

368
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
You didn't know anything.

369
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,560
Do you understand?

370
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,200
- But…
- All right.

371
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
It's getting colder.

372
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,120
It's spring all year round in Annan.

373
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,760
It's good for you
and your father's health there.

374
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,200
By the way,

375
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,840
do you know Que Siming?

376
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,600
The miracle doctor?

377
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
He's going to Annan.

378
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,140
He must have a way to cure you.

379
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,840
But he has a lot of rules,

380
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,260
and he has an odd temper.

381
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,500
How can he treat me?

382
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,120
He and I were friends before.

383
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,400
Although he has an odd temper,

384
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,720
his medical skills are great.

385
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,120
He will heal you.

386
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,640
All right.

387
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,550
Get in the carriage.

388
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,440
Su Yin.

389
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,680
If I survive,

390
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,040
I will do anything to repay you.

391
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,380
All right.

392
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,440
Stop it.

393
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,040
Go.

394
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,280
Just go.

395
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,545
Su Yin, I'll wait for you in Annan.

396
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,240
Okay.

397
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,240
Go.

398
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,438
Go.

399
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:55,975
Go.

400
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,150
Stop.

401
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,075
Stop.

402
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,950
Go.

403
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,850
Go.

404
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,888
Go.

405
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:43,000
Go.

406
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,440
Xiaobao, why is your face so pale?

407
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
And your hands are cold.

408
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,120
I've been standing outside for too long.

409
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,720
It's all Su Yin's fault.

410
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,493
He talked a lot to me there.

411
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:05,945
Xiaobao,

412
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,988
you will need His Highness' help.

413
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,700
Don't be so willful.

414
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,720
Do you understand?

415
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,720
Yes.

416
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,360
I wonder how Xiaoyu is doing.

417
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,060
She always kicked her covers off at night.

418
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,120
I wonder how she's doing.

419
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,460
Dear,

420
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,780
after all,

421
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,860
Xiaoyu is not our biological daughter.

422
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,160
We are destined to be separated.

423
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Zongzheng Huai'en is her brother.

424
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,760
He won't hurt her.

425
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,520
Don't worry.

426
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,440
Master.

427
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,230
Dad.

428
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,600
It's okay.

429
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,000
Dad.

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,360
Su Yin has got the miracle doctor.

431
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,060
He will cure your asthma.

432
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,520
The scenery of Annan is beautiful.

433
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,600
You and my mom can travel

434
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,880
and have fun together.

435
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,440
You can enjoy the rest of your lives.

436
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,120
Dear,

437
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,180
I got it.

438
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,480
He wants to get rid of us.

439
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,840
You can't.

440
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,440
Xiaobao, we will follow you

441
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,210
wherever you go.

442
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,480
Dear,

443
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,120
I was kidding.

444
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,500
Don't take it seriously.

445
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,760
Look at the situation.

446
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,340
How could you joke with me?

447
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,440
Dad.

448
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,960
Dear, you have great strength.

449
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,520
Go.

450
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,840
Go.

451
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,240
Go.

452
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,410
Go.

453
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:08,487
Go.

454
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Go.

455
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:24,372
Go.

456
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:26,862
Go.

457
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,271
Go.

458
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,054
Go.

459
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,603
Go.

460
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,375
Stop.

461
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,400
Dad, are you all right?

462
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,913
Are you all right, dear?

463
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:45,680
I'm all right.

464
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,880
Come out.

465
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
Young Master Jin.

466
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Su…

467
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,800
What's going on?

468
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,780
It's all right, Young Master.

469
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,480
There are some rocks blocking the way.

470
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,320
Let's go.

471
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,840
Go.

472
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:26,649
Go.

473
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,580
Go.

474
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,680
Stop.

475
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:46,776
Stop.

476
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:52,857
Xiaobao.

477
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,600
Su Yin.

478
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,140
Uncle, why are you still in the mood to drink?

479
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,160
Your Royal Highness,

480
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,820
it's inappropriate for you to panic like this.

481
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,680
The Jin family was taken away.

482
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Why don't you worry at all?

483
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,120
Aren't you afraid
that my father will punish you?

484
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,960
The chief military officer
has gone to investigate.

485
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,160
Don't worry about it.

486
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
How can I not worry?

487
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,720
I asked you to quell the rebellion.

488
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,320
My father and mother

489
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,840
had high hopes for me.

490
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,480
Now, I don't have the roster.

491
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,260
And I lost the account book
of the Furun Chamber of Commerce.

492
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,560
Now, I don't know

493
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,880
who took the Jin family, our only clue, away.

494
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,200
The Gu poison you prepared is useless.

495
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,460
I think Jin Xiaobao has long
been in collusion with Zongzheng Huai'en,

496
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,140
and he won't help you.

497
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,600
Are we going to wait and do nothing?

498
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Shaoyu,

499
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,900
a little impatience spoils great plans.

500
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,960
We should consider it.

501
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,360
Consider it.

502
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,420
You always say that.

503
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,600
If you don't care about it,

504
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll investigate it myself.

505
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,440
Shaoyu,

506
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,140
focus on the big picture.

507
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,840
The chief military officer
has gone to investigate it.

508
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,760
I'm going to see my cousin.

509
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,320
He'll find a way.

510
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Lord.

511
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,081
Lord.

512
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:37,341
Our plan failed.

513
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:38,400
Mr. Jin…

514
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
He wouldn't go with us.

515
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,520
What did you say?

516
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,126
He hates you for deceiving him.

517
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,700
He asked me to tell you

518
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,280
that he didn't want to see you in his life.

519
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,640
That's not true.

520
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,440
It's true.

521
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,760
Su Yin left with him.

522
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,640
Su Yin.

523
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,000
Su Yin.

524
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
Do you want to fight me alone or together?

525
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Lord, are you crazy?

526
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,080
Whoever stops me dies.

527
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,320
Don't forget
that I taught you all your kung fu.

528
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
Huai'en,

529
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,120
I told you

530
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,960
you'd get the country

531
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,000
after you helped me complete my great cause.

532
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,240
Not to mention Jin Xiaobao.

533
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,160
Why are you so stubborn?

534
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,200
I won't trust you anymore.

535
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,080
To you

536
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,760
and you guys,

537
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,200
I'm just a pawn.

538
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,800
Whatever.

539
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,400
Anyway, you can't get out of here today.

540
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,580
Yours and mine are a pair.

541
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,300
First of all, you can't push me away.

542
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,420
After I met you,

543
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,320
I only love you.

544
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,080
I will forgive you

545
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,720
no matter what you do wrong.

546
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,936
Be careful.

547
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,560
Be careful.

548
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,880
Zhaocai, Jinbao.

549
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,545
Take the master and madam back to rest.

550
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,323
Dad.

551
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:27,142
Mom.

552
00:42:27,142 --> 00:42:28,600
Go get some rest.

553
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,920
Xiaobao.

554
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,549
Mr. and Mrs. Jin,

555
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:37,120
I'll show Xiaobao around.

556
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,320
Let's go, Master.

557
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,840
Go.

558
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Go.

559
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,800
Be careful.

560
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,400
How are you?

561
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:12,848
I'm fine.

562
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,447
It doesn't hurt very much right now.

563
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:16,800
I just feel a little cold.

564
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,720
Looks like it's not a good time.
