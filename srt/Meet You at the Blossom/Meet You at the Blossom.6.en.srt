1
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:41,240
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Mr. Jin.

3
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,420
Huai'en.

4
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,148
You lied to me.

5
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,265
I didn't.

6
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,836
I didn't.

7
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,680
Huai'en, listen to me.

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,895
Mr. Jin is hiding
such a pretty girl in his mansion.

9
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:09,660
No wonder he left the girl in Yicui House
to themselves.

10
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,380
No, I didn't.

11
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,120
Why didn't Mr. Jin go out often?

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,360
It turned out
that he had a pretty girl in his house.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
Look at her pretty face.

14
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,600
She must be a woman dressing like a man.

15
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,100
She's a woman dressing like a man.

16
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,580
No wonder Mr. Jin hasn't been here lately.

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,040
No.

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
She's really gorgeous.

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
Gorgeous.

20
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,120
Gorgeous.

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Mr. Jin, good for you.

22
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:44,440
You're so lucky.

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,920
No.

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Where did you get such a beautiful girl?

25
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,820
My hand.

26
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Run.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,120
Huai'en, listen to me.

28
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
I didn't.

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,320
Huai'en, listen to me.

30
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,145
I'm not here to have fun.

31
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,145
I am here to…

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,565
Have you forgotten your promise to me?

33
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,193
No. I haven't.

34
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,856
Is that what you call liking?

35
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,468
Why did you lie to me?

36
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,480
Huai'en.

37
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,639
Huai'en, I didn't.

38
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,380
Huai'en.

39
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,700
I didn't serve you well, did I?

40
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,980
Why did you come to a place like this?

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,940
Huai'en.

42
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
Huai'en, you have to trust me.

43
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,480
I didn't.

44
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,200
Huai'en.

45
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
Young master.

46
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,520
He's fine.

47
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
Rather than getting back at me,

48
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
you'd better think

49
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
about how to keep their mouths shut.

50
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
Stop crying.

51
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
It's all right.

52
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Go.

53
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
Jin Xiaobao,

54
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,920
You tantalized me first.

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,920
Since you tantalized me,

56
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
you can't go back.

57
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay if you can't control yourself.

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll control you.

59
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,440
You can hang out with girls

60
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
without fear.

61
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,480
That's because your Jin family is rich.

62
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Then, I'll take everything from you

63
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,480
so that you can't tantalize anyone else.

64
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:48,960
From now on,

65
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,000
no matter where you are,

66
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,640
you can only rely on me.

67
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
He woke up.

68
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:35,787
Young master.

69
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,386
Young master, don't cry.

70
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,960
Young master, cry if you want to.

71
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,083
Young master,

72
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,160
Yicui House has been taken care of.

73
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,120
I've given them enough money.

74
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,440
They wouldn't say anything about it.

75
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,580
We didn't tell the master
and the madam either. Right?

76
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,400
It's all right, young master.

77
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
As for Huai'en,

78
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,920
we won't let him go.

79
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
No.

80
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,056
No.

81
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,536
If he dies,

82
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,643
what should I do?

83
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,200
What was wrong with me?

84
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
How did I fall in love with him?

85
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,400
Young master,

86
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,160
you might be obsessed.

87
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,880
I heard about a religion in Miao district.

88
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,840
They have Gu poison

89
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,160
to confuse men.

90
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,840
I…

91
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
I think Gu poison

92
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,505
is used by women.

93
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,640
You're right.

94
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Says who? Men can use it, too.

95
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Young master, I think you were poisoned by him.

96
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,160
Right, young master.

97
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
You must have been poisoned.

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
Otherwise,

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,006
how can you be so infatuated with a man?

100
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:00,860
He's right.

101
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,400
Young master, don't worry.

102
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,780
We'll offer a large reward

103
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,640
to find the poisoner.

104
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,340
When your poison is lifted,

105
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,123
we'll deal with him.

106
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Does…

107
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,920
Does that really work?

108
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,183
Of course.

109
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,660
You go get people from that religion.

110
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,685
I'll give him
all the money he wants.

111
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,100
Ask him to poison Huai'en.

112
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,220
Okay.

113
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,740
And make Huai'en fall in love with me.

114
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Young master,

115
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,620
are you out of mind?

116
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,980
He almost killed you yesterday.

117
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,780
Yeah.

118
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,020
You can't blame him for yesterday.

119
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,886
But he shouldn't have been so cruel to me.

120
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:47,740
How did I fall in love with such a bad man?

121
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,980
All right, young master.

122
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,580
Zhuang.

123
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,660
Master.

124
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,740
What did His Highness say?

125
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,700
Huai'en

126
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,378
is the son of the second prince
and Princess Xue.

127
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,420
What?

128
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,660
What should we do now?

129
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,700
Kill him now.

130
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,140
Kill him?

131
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,310
Zhuang,

132
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,340
go arrange it.

133
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,060
We'll take action tonight.

134
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:10,846
Mr. Jin, please don't kill him.

135
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,180
We need to use him
to draw the second prince out.

136
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,820
Master, are you really going to kill him?

137
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,340
You can't disobey His Highness.

138
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,273
Dear,

139
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,980
what should we do?

140
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,450
His Highness is from the Imperial Court.

141
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,023
Zheng Huai'en is Xue Wei's grandson.

142
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:54,303
Although we didn't mean
to kill Xue's whole family.

143
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,580
We are responsible.

144
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,780
If they look into it in the future,

145
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:03,143
will we get away with it?

146
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:06,260
What do we tell His Highness if we kill him?

147
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,940
What do we tell him?

148
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,300
We'll see.

149
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,140
Anyway, the secret path
will be completed in three days.

150
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,620
By then, we will go away.

151
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,330
Xiaobao is in love with Huai'en.

152
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,636
Don't mention Xiaobao to me.

153
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,220
Shame on Xiaobao.

154
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,700
I don't know
what Zheng Huai'en did to him.

155
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,860
All right.

156
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,540
When Xiaobao knows the truth,

157
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,820
he will leave him.

158
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,180
I hope so.

159
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,100
Lord,

160
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,460
Master Jin knows who you are.

161
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,580
He's gathering his men.

162
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:15,700
Ask all the warriors to take action tonight.

163
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,500
Yes.

164
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,020
Wait.

165
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,940
Don't hurt the Jin family.

166
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:03,976
I came to you to explain.

167
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,420
I know

168
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,807
I used to have a bad reputation.

169
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:11,820
But…

170
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,180
But I only love you now.

171
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,763
I had to hang out with them

172
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:21,163
to get the prescription for my dad yesterday.

173
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:23,860
I didn't expect me to get drunk.

174
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,820
But I didn't do anything.

175
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,820
What if I'd been a little late yesterday?

176
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,740
Sorry, I was wrong.

177
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,580
Don't be mad, okay?

178
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,660
I promise I will never drink again.

179
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
If you're still mad,

180
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,643
you can hit me.

181
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,740
Do you think I won't hit you?

182
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,660
Hit me.

183
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,060
As long as you are not mad,

184
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,660
you can hit me to death.

185
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,700
You're good at pleasing me.

186
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,700
Jin Xiaobao, listen.

187
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,580
I'll let bygones be bygones.

188
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,300
But

189
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,260
now that you're engaged to me,

190
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,180
if you go to that kind of place again,

191
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,340
I'll break your legs.

192
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,860
Got it?

193
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,380
I'll never go there again.

194
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,500
It's all right.

195
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,300
It's a night watchman.

196
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,100
Huai'en,

197
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,460
you're holding me so tight.

198
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,180
I can't breathe.

199
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,500
Xiaobao.

200
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,180
You did something wrong today.

201
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,700
And I forgave you.

202
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,300
If I do something wrong,

203
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,740
you have to forgive me, too.

204
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,500
Of course.

205
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,820
I will forgive you for whatever you do.

206
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,460
A man should love his wife.

207
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,540
Do you mean it?

208
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,020
You swear.

209
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,940
You swear you'll forgive me

210
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,100
whatever I do wrong.

211
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,700
I, Jin Xiaobao, swear to the Lord

212
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
that I will forgive you

213
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,020
no matter what you do wrong.

214
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,170
Otherwise…

215
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,780
You don't want to go to a brothel, do you?

216
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,180
I can't agree with that.

217
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,020
Other than that,
I forgive you for whatever you do.

218
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Huai'en.

219
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Huai'en.

220
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,460
What's wrong with you?

221
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,420
Xiaobao.

222
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,260
I haven't told you what my last name is, right?

223
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,900
Isn't your last name Zheng?

224
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,700
It's not.

225
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,660
My name is

226
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,820
Zongzheng Huai'en.

227
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,900
Surround him.

228
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,220
Get him.

229
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,460
Protect our lord.

230
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:54,213
Who's there?

231
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Zhuang.

232
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,596
Zhuang.

233
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,320
Zhuang.

234
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,420
Stop chasing.

235
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:48,223
Let's bury Zhuang.

236
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,696
It's all right.

237
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:56,253
We still have the roster.

238
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,700
We still have a chance.

239
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,186
We still have a chance.

240
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,519
Master, something happened.

241
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,719
Master.

242
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:07,353
Master.

243
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:09,626
Xiaoyu is missing.

244
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,946
The roster is missing.

245
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:21,106
Master.

246
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,740
It's over.

247
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,180
It's all over.

248
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,540
Lord.

249
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,860
What does the Imperial Court
intend to do with the Jin family

250
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,700
when I get the roster?

251
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,420
Kill them all.

252
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,460
What does my dad want to do with them?

253
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,260
He wants the same.

254
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,260
Li Gongxiang,

255
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,900
the Jin family is extremely wealthy.

256
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,780
They have countless treasures.

257
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,700
I don't care if you hand them over

258
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,860
to the Imperial Court or to my dad.

259
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,340
But you must not kill the Jin family.

260
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,740
As you command, Lord.

261
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,060
Prince Shen has got the information.

262
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,940
Now the city is on lockdown.

263
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,980
You can't leave through the main gate.

264
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,460
This is a confidant
who has been with me for 20 years.

265
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,940
He will take you out of the city
by the secret path.

266
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,060
Your Royal Highness's.

267
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,220
Sit down.

268
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,220
We got there late.

269
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,580
Huai'en got the roster.

270
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,460
I set up traps in Huaizhou.

271
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,380
But they seemed to be on guard.

272
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,660
My men waited all night

273
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,780
and got nothing.

274
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,380
By now,

275
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,420
he should have taken the roster

276
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,780
out of the city.

277
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,180
Mr. Wang,

278
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,460
why don't we go straight to Jinqishan Mountain

279
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,032
and destroy their base?

280
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,940
We have countless fine soldiers.

281
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,967
Are we afraid of those rustics?

282
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,300
Your Royal Highness,

283
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,140
Jinqi Mountain is miasmatic,

284
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,368
and its terrain is complex.

285
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,660
Zongzheng Yuzhan has been staying there
for nearly 20 years.

286
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,180
If we attack rashly,

287
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,780
we are like handing ourselves over.

288
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,756
The chief military officer
has been a spy for years.

289
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:02,780
Didn't he get a clear picture of their base?

290
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,963
Shaoyu.

291
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,220
Calm down.

292
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,798
Your Royal Highness, please calm down.

293
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,616
Zongzheng Yuzhan is eccentric
and suspicious.

294
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:17,003
No one but Gao and Huai'en

295
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:18,920
could approach him.

296
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,820
Gao is loyal to him.

297
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,860
As for Huai'en,
I kind of watched him grow up.

298
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,900
He killed

299
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,180
and robbed

300
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,320
for Zongzheng Yuzhan.

301
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,860
He never disobeyed him.

302
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,958
But this time, he secretly deployed in advance

303
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,820
to save the lives of the Jin family.

304
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,940
I think it had something to do
with the young master of the Jin family.

305
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,200
We might as well make good use

306
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,100
of the young master of the Jin family.

307
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,560
It must be so.

308
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,500
He made out with Jin

309
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,480
in the cave the other day.

310
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,820
It was disgusting.

311
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,246
So,

312
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:02,893
Mr. Li, what are you going to do?

313
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,120
Your Highness,

314
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,162
do you remember the Lingxi Gu poison

315
00:26:08,162 --> 00:26:09,780
you mentioned last time?

316
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,860
Lingxi Gu poison?

317
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,380
Is that the Gu poison
that can manipulate people?

318
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:21,435
Do you want to use that on Huai'en?

319
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,637
It's dawn, Mr. Li.

320
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:36,013
It's time for you to meet your old friend.

321
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,525
Excuse me.

322
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:13,145
Go.

323
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,025
Hurry up.

324
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,136
Go.

325
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,400
I'll kill you.

326
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,960
Master.

327
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,760
I'll kill you.

328
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,260
Dad.

329
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,080
I'll kill you.

330
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,573
Dad.

331
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:28,526
You'll kill him.

332
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:30,720
Why did you hit me?

333
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,840
Xiaobao.

334
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,240
Mom.

335
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
Kill me if you want.

336
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,520
What does Xiaobao know?

337
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,560
What happened?

338
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,040
Where is Huai'en?

339
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,413
Don't mention him, Xiaobao.

340
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:52,120
He took Xiaoyu

341
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,600
and the account book away.

342
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,830
Our Jin family is finished.

343
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,840
What?

344
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,040
There's no time to explain.

345
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,800
Xiaobao,

346
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,240
I've set Zhaocai and Jinbao free.

347
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,340
They have nothing to do
with the Jin family anymore.

348
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,320
Follow them

349
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,440
to Su Yin's in Annan.

350
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
Don't come back.

351
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,200
What are you talking about, mom?

352
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,220
Zhaocai, Jinbao, take him with you.

353
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,280
My son, be good.

354
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,093
I'm not leaving.

355
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm not leaving, mom.

356
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,196
Take him away.

357
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:23,400
Dad, mom, let's leave together.

358
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,080
Young master.

359
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't want to be separated from you.

360
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,480
Dad.

361
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,500
Just go, Xiaobao.

362
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
Master.

363
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,460
Mr. Jin,

364
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,320
how are you doing?

365
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,030
Get out of the way.

366
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,360
Back off.

367
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,387
Back off. Move.

368
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Get out of the way.

369
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Get out of the way.

370
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,000
Get out of the way.

371
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:01,880
Move.

372
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,640
Get out of the way.

373
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,360
Did you hear the news?

374
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,880
The richest man in Jiangnan was confiscated
of his property and sentenced to death.

375
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,760
Great.

376
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,240
Those dishonest merchants

377
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,680
should be sentenced.

378
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,740
I can't afford two drinks a day.

379
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,308
But they use nice Huadiao wine
to wash their feet.

380
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:44,080
It is said that they will be sent
to Linjing in three days

381
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,325
and be decapitated in the autumn.

382
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,970
What do we do?

383
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,320
They won't be decapitated, will they?

384
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:54,775
I don't think so.

385
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,000
Let's eat.

386
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Only when you are full can you have strength.

387
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,740
We'll go to the Su family after the meal.

388
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,040
His Highness said

389
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,140
we could go to him if we have difficulty.

390
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,280
He will save our young master.

391
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,220
Let's eat.

392
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,260
I don't want to eat.

393
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,380
Come on.

394
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,320
Eat.

395
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,900
Get in there. Hurry.

396
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:24,340
Get in there.

397
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,180
Dad.

398
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,060
Dad.

399
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,935
Dad.

400
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,560
What happened?

401
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,660
What are we guilty of?

402
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,360
Why are we confiscated of our property
and sentenced to death?

403
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,140
What is in that account book?

404
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,600
What's the use of knowing that?

405
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,220
Even if I die, I want to know it.

406
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,900
Dear,

407
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,401
it's time to let him know.

408
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,860
Twenty years ago,

409
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,180
the new emperor ascended the throne.

410
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,980
He made Xue Tongen, the daughter of Xue Wei,
the Imperial Concubine.

411
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:22,540
Xue Tongen was Lianyu's aunt?

412
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,500
The most beautiful woman in the world?

413
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,620
That's right.

414
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,080
Princess Xue was favored by His Majesty.

415
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,740
Xue Wei took advantage of that
and got promoted.

416
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,990
He held an important position
in the Jiangnan Imperial Silk Weaving Workshop.

417
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:42,780
Soon after,

418
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,100
Princess Xue was pregnant.

419
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,200
As a result, the Xue family gained more power.

420
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,900
All officials flattered them.

421
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,380
They were very successful.

422
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,860
Later,

423
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,490
the Empress found out that Princess Xue
had an affair with the second prince,

424
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,640
and that child was not His Majesty's.

425
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,100
To cover up the scandal,

426
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,200
Princess Xue was killed by the Empress.

427
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,980
The second prince escaped with the child.

428
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,800
And Xue Wei was condemned.

429
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,716
Overnight,

430
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:25,980
the Xue family

431
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,420
was finished.

432
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,780
But…

433
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,020
what does that have to do with our family?

434
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,880
Because after that,

435
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,100
the second prince united with Xue Wei.

436
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,380
He used the name of prince

437
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,980
to lure Xue Wei into rebellion.

438
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,040
The two of them hit it off.

439
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,260
They colluded,

440
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,380
accumulated wealth,

441
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,020
and recruited soldiers.

442
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,680
Then, Xue Wei chose some merchants
who did not have much money

443
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,460
but had momentum

444
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,700
and lured them with huge profits

445
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
to establish the Furun Chamber of Commerce.

446
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:08,920
Our family

447
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,100
was one of them.

448
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,620
The Furun Chamber of Commerce
became bigger and bigger.

449
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,640
Soon, it accumulated a large amount of w-w-

450
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,620
wealth.

451
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,740
I thought

452
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,400
our Jin family was destined to succeed.

453
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,980
However,

454
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,020
five years ago,

455
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,320
I found that our Jin family

456
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,460
was just a puppet used
by the second prince to accumulate wealth.

457
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,560
Dad.

458
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,700
Dad.

459
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,550
Dad.

460
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,220
His Majesty is young and promising.

461
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,280
Not only did he quell the civil strife,

462
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,020
but he was about
to defeat the uncivilized tribes.

463
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,500
After his triumphant return,

464
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,780
he will rule the country.

465
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,460
The wealth amassed by our Jin family

466
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,350
will fill the empty treasury.

467
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,750
At that time,

468
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,775
our Jin family

469
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:39,100
will be the first to be dealt with
by the Imperial Court.

470
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:41,475
Dad.

471
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,818
We are hanging on by a thread.

472
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:51,460
So, I recorded all my possessions

473
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,620
in an account book.

474
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,260
Now, the account book is missing.

475
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,680
The Imperial Court

476
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,740
can hold us accountable fairly and squarely.

477
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,675
I had…

478
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,460
already thought of a way out.

479
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,440
Our family

480
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,660
could have left safely in three days.

481
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,260
I didn't expect

482
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,980
Huai'en

483
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,220
to be the son of the second prince.

484
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,300
He took the account book.

485
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,836
My work went down the drain.

486
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,880
The account book was sewn
by me in Xiaoyu's clothes.

487
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,900
Even Xiaoyu didn't know it.

488
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,860
But he found it out.

489
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,820
Master.

490
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,840
Did you see Huai'en take the account book
and Xiaoyu in person?

491
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,420
Is there

492
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,180
a misunderstanding?

493
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,740
Xiaobao.

494
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,320
Look at the situation.

495
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,180
Why are you still making excuses for him?

496
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,940
What did Huai'en do to you, Xiaobao?

497
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,140
No, dad.

498
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,223
I just want to know the truth.

499
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,525
Master.

500
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,180
Zhang Chun has been
doing background checks for years.

501
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,040
He never made a mistake.

502
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,860
You looked into him, too.

503
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,680
He's just a young master of a normal express.

504
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,940
He's not the second prince's son.

505
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,680
There must be a misunderstanding.

506
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,940
No.

507
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,260
Xiaobao.

508
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:48,260
Huai'en

509
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,980
is the son of the second prince.

510
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,660
No.

511
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,980
He wouldn't do this to me.

512
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,220
Why would he do that?

513
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,100
Dad.

514
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,223
Dad, mom.

515
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,280
He wouldn't do this to me.

516
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,620
You don't know.

517
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,260
He risked his life to save me.

518
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,100
How could he do this to me?

519
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,160
I know.

520
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,275
He must have been forced by his father.

521
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,500
His father is inhumane.

522
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,540
He had a lot of injuries.

523
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,000
His father treated him badly.

524
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,060
He must have been forced by his father.

525
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,580
He must have been forced by his father.

526
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,360
Xiaobao.

527
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,380
Xiaobao.

528
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,440
Even if he did it,

529
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,380
he had his reasons.

530
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,760
You have to trust me.

531
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,660
He wouldn't do this to me.

532
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:53,985
I didn't expect Mr. Jin to be infatuated.

533
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,580
Let's sit down and talk.

534
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,180
I didn't expect Mr. Jin

535
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,900
to have such deep feelings for my nephew.

536
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:18,926
Nephew?

537
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,140
Yeah.

538
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,020
He's the son of my second brother
and Princess Xue.

539
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,700
No, he's not.

540
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,600
He's just a young master of a normal express.

541
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,980
How is this possible?

542
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,100
Xiaobao.

543
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,400
I see.

544
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,820
It's you.

545
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,140
It's you, right?

546
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,020
You tried to kill him many times.

547
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,400
Now, you're slandering him.

548
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,980
What do you want?

549
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,260
Xiaobao.

550
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,060
Sit down.

551
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,460
Zhang Chun.

552
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,140
All the information he gave you was fake.

553
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,600
Mr. Jin, I was forced.

554
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,780
Zongzheng Huai'en poisoned me.

555
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,580
I could only follow his orders.

556
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,650
Xiaobao.

557
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,672
Xiaobao.

558
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,120
Over the years,

559
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,300
Huai'en has changed his identity many times

560
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,020
to help my second brother with his rebellion.

561
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,140
He's ruthless and inhuman.

562
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,320
But he does everything
my second brother tells him.

563
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,618
He lied to you from the beginning.

564
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:43,500
Xiaobao.

565
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,300
His purpose…

566
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,100
was to get the account book
of the Furun Chamber of Commerce.

567
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:52,140
I've been deceived by him, too.

568
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,880
Because of our blood relationship,

569
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,580
I wanted to persuade him to change his ways.

570
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,700
But he took advantage of my sympathy

571
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,940
and stole my vital roster.

572
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:07,160
Didn't he already give you the roster?

573
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,860
He gave you the roster to save me.

574
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,475
Xiaobao.

575
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,020
Are you talking about this?

576
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,420
It's fake.

577
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,460
Huai'en used two of his confidants

578
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,500
to make a distraction.

579
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,720
He used you

580
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,560
and the fake roster

581
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,020
to bait me.

582
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,460
The real roster has been taken by his man
to his dad.

583
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,620
You

584
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,870
and I

585
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,240
were both tricked by him.

586
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,020
Xiaobao.

587
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Jin Xiaobao.

588
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,940
You tantalized me first.

589
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,480
From now on,

590
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,580
no matter where you are,

591
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,620
you can only rely on me.

592
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,460
How is this possible?

593
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,420
Stop.

594
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,900
Stop.

595
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,700
How can it be so real?

596
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,640
Your Highness,

597
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,260
please leave him alone.

598
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,040
My second brother
has been lying low and gathering strength.

599
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,220
He studied crooked ways

600
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,020
and established the Tong Sect.

601
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,740
His followers are all over the country.

602
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,700
There are his men in the Imperial Court.

603
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,900
There are names

604
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,260
of traitors that the Imperial Court
painstakingly collected over the years.

605
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,540
Now,

606
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,180
my second brother
has got your family's property.

607
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,980
He can recruit soldiers

608
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,180
and rebel now.

609
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,140
The country will be in chaos soon.

610
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,960
You helped with that.

611
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
Mr. Jin.

612
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,340
Stop.

613
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,625
Your Highness.

614
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,180
We're going to die.

615
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,563
Why do you have to be so aggressive?

616
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,580
You can…

617
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,860
redeem yourselves.

618
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,420
The Furun Chamber of Commerce
still has some property.

619
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,100
I think only you know where they are, Mr. Jin.

620
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,280
Huai'en worked secretly
to save the three of you.

621
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,820
I think that's because
he wanted to get the property.

622
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,660
So, he will meet you again.

623
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,740
When he comes to you,

624
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,340
all you have to do

625
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,740
is put this on him when he's off guard.

626
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,220
So you can redeem yourselves.

627
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,980
It's Gu poison.

628
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,580
Open it when you need it.

629
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,740
All you have to do is put it
on Huai'en's bare skin.

630
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,740
When you get it done,

631
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,780
I'll let the three of you go.

632
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,780
Mr. Jin,

633
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,460
even if you don't think about yourself,

634
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,900
think about your elderly parents.

635
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,300
It's all Huai'en's fault

636
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,060
that you're where you are today.

637
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,060
He has no sincerity for you.

638
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,380
Are you going to risk your parents' lives

639
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,960
for him?

640
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,820
Think about it, Mr. Jin.

641
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,425
It's not true.

642
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,020
Why?

643
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,420
Why did he do this to me?

644
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,540
Why?
