1
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
There is no antidote for an aphrodisiac.

2
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Hand over the antidote!

3
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
Miss Zheng!

4
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,240
Miss Zheng. Miss Zheng!

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,840
Miss Zheng. You were poisoned to save me.

6
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,200
I won't leave you behind.

7
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
Just let me help to remove the poison for you.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
I will definitely be responsible to you.

9
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
Who wants you to save me?

10
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,920
- I...
- I understand.

11
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Just for the sake of
risking your life to save me.

12
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
Hey!

13
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Miss Zheng. Why... Why don't you have breasts?

14
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,080
Why... Why are you a man?

15
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Go away!

16
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,920
What... What...

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,298
Miss Zheng.

18
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:33,200
Although you lied to me,
I... I can't leave you to die.

19
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
Just let me neutralize the poison.

20
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,840
Useless!

21
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,520
Mr. Zhuang, post a city-wide reward.

22
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Those who find the young master
will be rewarded 10,000 taels of gold!

23
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,920
Yes, Master...

24
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,480
You two!

25
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,242
Take all the guards to find the young master,

26
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:30,480
even if you've to turn the entire
Huizhou upside down!

27
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, sir.

28
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,080
If you can't find Xiaobao,
you two will be dead!

29
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,240
- Yes, sir.
- Get lost!

30
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,920
Miss Zheng...

31
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,080
Bah... Bastard!

32
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,480
Where are you?!

33
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,800
This ungrateful bastard!

34
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,222
If I don't take revenge, I'm not a real man.

35
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,440
Just wait and see!

36
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,240
One day I'm gonna take you...

37
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,236
Young master, you're awake.

38
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,280
Are you hungry?

39
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,760
May I ask you where is this place?

40
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,000
This place is my young master's other house.

41
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,440
Your young master is Huaien?

42
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes.

43
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
Where is he?

44
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
We servants have no way to know
the young master's whereabouts.

45
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
You've been in a coma for two days.

46
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,960
My young master said that
you can leave when you wake up.

47
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,440
Two days!

48
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,760
Yes.

49
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh no! My parents must be worried.

50
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Please, can you send a message for me?

51
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Ask my parents to send someone to pick me up.

52
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,280
- Please?
- Yes sir.

53
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Young master.

54
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
Young master, the message has been sent
to the Jins to pick Jin Xiaobao home.

55
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Also, the Jins had been investigating you.

56
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Zhang Chun has intercepted it.

57
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
It's just...

58
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
You may not be able to disguise yourself
as a woman and stay at the Jin's anymore.

59
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,237
About the account book...

60
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:29,800
- What happened that day...
- All insiders have been settled.

61
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Don't tell my father about this.

62
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
About the account book...
I have my own plan.

63
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,280
Yes sir.

64
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,560
You'd better not let me catch you.
Otherwise I'll...

65
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,400
Young Master Jin.

66
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Why do you have this too?

67
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240
Have you met my brother? How is he?

68
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,040
Your brother?

69
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,320
It turns out you're all under Huaien.

70
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,080
How is he?

71
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,560
When I saw him, he was half-dead anyway.

72
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,720
But I gave him a bottle of medicine.

73
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,320
Where is he?

74
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,960
You want to know about your brother?

75
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,280
Sure, tell me where I can find
your young master.

76
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,560
I can't tell you anything.

77
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,400
At least you can tell me what his name is.

78
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
You think I don't know if you keep mum?

79
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
- Young master!
- Young master!

80
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
Young master!

81
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
- You scared us to death!
- Are you alright, young master?

82
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Are you alright?

83
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
You scared us to death!

84
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,560
If you don't let go, I will be dead.

85
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,160
Young master, you're hurt?

86
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,440
Hurt? Where?

87
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,633
It's a minor injury. I'm fine.

88
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
What happened to your faces?

89
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
My father did it?

90
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,200
Young master, it's our fault that
you went missing. We deserve it.

91
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,280
Yeah.

92
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,720
Young master, you were not aware, but that day,
when we followed the trail to find you,

93
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,200
there was only a pile of clothes left.

94
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
And we thought something bad
happened to you.

95
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
And then we saved a man
drenched in blood.

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,480
He's my brother. Where is he? Is he alright?

97
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,884
He is your brother? He's in my bed.

98
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,400
- What are you doing?
- Don't talk if you can't talk well.

99
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,320
Don't always hit Jinbao's head.

100
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,760
- He's not smart in the first place.
- That's right.

101
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,720
Friend, he had been unconscious,
but he's now out of danger.

102
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
I cannot thank you enough.

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
I'll follow you to the Jin's to pick him up.

104
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Why can't you express your gratitude?

105
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,800
Do you think we're a charity house?

106
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,280
The master and his servants are all the same.

107
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,240
I didn't save him for free.

108
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,400
You want to pick him up? Sure.

109
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,520
Ask your young master to do it personally.

110
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,240
And thank me in my face.

111
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,974
- Otherwise, don't think about picking him up.
- You!

112
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,205
You!

113
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,760
Young master.

114
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,520
Their young master is Miss Zheng?

115
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Go. Find me two beautiful girls.

116
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
Yes sir.

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
He wants me to pick him up personally?

118
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,880
Yes.

119
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,840
Don't blame yourself.

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,160
I didn't get the account book.
We have to go back to the Jin's anyway.

121
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
But Jin Xiaobao did that to you. He...

122
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
How are things on Zongzheng Lihan's side?

123
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,040
They are recuperating behind closed doors
after suffering heavy casualties.

124
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,280
Got it. You may leave.

125
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,480
Keep an eye on them.

126
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes.

127
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,920
I've told you that you have to pay
the price if you want anything.

128
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,760
No!

129
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Go down, and find the jade pendant.

130
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,560
Then you're considered to have
completed the task.

131
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,760
Why are you throwing my stuff?
That's what my mother left me!

132
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,840
You're wrong.

133
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:08,440
All your mother's stuff, including you...
only belong to me!

134
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Go down and find the jade pendant!

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Otherwise, you know what
the consequences will be.

136
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
My lord. The bottom of the cliff is dangerous.

137
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,280
It's surrounded by jackals.

138
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,520
The young master is still young, after all.
He...

139
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,320
He should have understood.

140
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,160
He was born with nothing.

141
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,840
Young Master Jin.

142
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
Do you feel good, young master?

143
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,720
So busy here.

144
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Young master.

145
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,520
Good.

146
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,280
Is it hard enough, young master?

147
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
Yes.

148
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,240
Harder.

149
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,600
- Do you feel good, young master?
- Good.

150
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Give me a grape.

151
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Get me a cup of wine.

152
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Come here. Let me reward you.

153
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,560
You should have one, too, my Master.

154
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
Is it sweet?

155
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,520
I want to eat one more, my Master.

156
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,080
My Master.

157
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
My Master? Master Jin.

158
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,800
What's wrong, Master Jin? Master Jin.

159
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,080
- Are you okay, Master Jin?
- Master Jin.

160
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,200
- My Master.
- Are you okay?

161
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,760
- My Master.
- What's wrong, my Master?

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,080
- Leave me alone!
- Are you okay, my Master?

163
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
My Master!

164
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,280
What's wrong?

165
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,840
- What's wrong, my Master?
- My Master.

166
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,800
- My Master.
- What's wrong?

167
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,360
The grape is stuck in my throat.

168
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
What happened, my Master?

169
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,280
Get out.

170
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,400
- What's going on?
- We don't know.

171
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,065
It has nothing to do with us.

172
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,560
Get out.

173
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,880
Now.

174
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,400
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- It's so scary.

175
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,200
My Master. What's going on, my Master?

176
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720
Are you okay?

177
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
Are you okay, my Master? Are you okay?

178
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
My Master.

179
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,000
Those two didn't serve you well just now,
right?

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't be angry. We're already in town.

181
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
I'll get you two better ones right away.

182
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,280
Zhaocai, Jinbao. Let me ask you.

183
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,360
I am obviously not in love with someone.

184
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,280
But every time I see the faces of other women,

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,880
I cannot help but think of her.

186
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,440
Why is that?

187
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
- That is just love.
- Shut up.

188
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,120
My Master. Is that person Miss Zheng?

189
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
What did she do to you?

190
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,320
No. Nothing.

191
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,640
I know.

192
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
He knows?

193
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
- What do you know?
- Just shut up.

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
My Master. I'm telling you,
this is definitely the situation

195
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,360
where love gives birth to hate.

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,400
What?

197
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,200
Novels often say, what one cannot get
is what one wants most.

198
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,600
Miss Zheng has always
treated you with dismissiveness.

199
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,080
But you treat her with
deep longing all the time.

200
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,720
So whoever you meet,
you're reminded of Miss Zheng.

201
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,080
What one cannot get is what one wants most.

202
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
I see!

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,480
Xiaobao!

204
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,600
Brother!

205
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,675
Xiaobao. Xiaobao, let me take a look.

206
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,448
Are you injured?

207
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,960
Mother, I'm fine. Don't worry.

208
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,440
Xiaoyu, I'm okay. Don't cry.

209
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,920
You poor kid...

210
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,800
We can talk about it after we're back home.

211
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Don't cry out here in public.

212
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,360
Others may think something bad happened to us.

213
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,484
I don't care about others.

214
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:17,120
You are still unapologetic
for making your mother cry.

215
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
Spill it.

216
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,280
What is going on?

217
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,720
Where is that Miss Zheng?

218
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,240
She... has returned home.

219
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,520
Returned home?

220
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
- Yes.
- Aren't you marrying her?

221
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,520
Oh, Father. You know me.

222
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,960
There're plenty of women whom I like.

223
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,720
She's just one of them.

224
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
Really?

225
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,200
But I heard you won't marry anyone but her.

226
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
Su Yin. What are you doing here?

227
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,720
I sent someone to invite the Prince here.

228
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,200
It's time to get someone to discipline you.

229
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
Father. What do you mean?

230
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
Who exactly is your son? Me or him?

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,320
- You...
- Shush, Xiaobao.

232
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,840
Well?

233
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't you know how distinguished the Prince is?

234
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,480
How can you call him my son?

235
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Uncle Jin, please don't be too bothered.

236
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,560
We grew up together.
I know he didn't mean it.

237
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Now that you asked me for help,
I will handle it.

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,200
Please take a rest first.

239
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,426
If you can help take care of this idiot,
I will feel much more relieved.

240
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,800
Let me go, Su Yin!

241
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,520
Go ahead.

242
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,240
What's going on these days?

243
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,720
Who is that Miss Zheng?

244
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm telling you, you've messed
with someone you shouldn't have.

245
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,880
And you're also offended Prince Shen.

246
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,840
This matter is of great importance.

247
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,960
If not handled properly,
it may implicate your whole family.

248
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
Don't you threaten me!

249
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,360
You always liked scaring me since we were kids.

250
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,040
I only saved someone from injustice.

251
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,560
Injustice?

252
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,000
Alright. Then why is that person
being attacked?

253
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,240
Have you figured it out?

254
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
I...

255
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,080
She's... just from an ordinary family.

256
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,000
She went out to visit relatives,
but was targeted by those bad guys.

257
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,360
So what's her full name? What's her address?

258
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,360
- Haven't found out yet.
- Haven't found out yet?

259
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,840
And you claimed you'd marry no one but her?

260
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,960
There are people trying to kill her. How
could she have come from an ordinary family?

261
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,120
Come on, shouldn't you think carefully
before acting?

262
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,360
I just didn't have time to check it out yet.

263
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,080
You just do nothing but scold me.
Why don't you check it then?

264
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Of course I did check it out.

265
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,560
Your Grace.

266
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,240
Your Grace, we've got some clues.

267
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,920
Stay here. Behave well.

268
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's go.

269
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
My Master.

270
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,280
That... that... that Zuo... He's awake.

271
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,800
Are you hungry?

272
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,878
Are you able to speak?

273
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:47,200
You... really can't speak, can you?

274
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
My Master.

275
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,280
He seems to be a mute.

276
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
Get out.

277
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,680
- Go.
- Get out.

278
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,640
I already know everything.

279
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,440
You have a younger brother named Youying.

280
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,600
And your young master is a man!

281
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,260
How did you know that?

282
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Because your young master and I
have become sworn brothers.

283
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,480
Your brother Youying
is also at my disposal now.

284
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,880
Both of them have confessed the reason
why you came to my home.

285
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,520
You'd better give me an explanation, too.

286
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,440
You are not willing to cooperate, right?

287
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,760
Don't regret it then.

288
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,400
My Master.

289
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,560
What happened, my Master?
Are you angry?

290
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,120
Why are you angry?

291
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,480
What's going on with Zhang Chun?
Why is there no any news yet?

292
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Ask him.

293
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
What's going on with Zhang Chun?
Why is there no any news yet?

294
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Jin Xiaobao.

295
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,120
Where's Jin Xiaobao? Come out!

296
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,600
You fool! You really made a fool of yourself.

297
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,160
Su Yin. Can you just stop?

298
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,960
Just because you entered society
earlier than me doesn't mean you are better!

299
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,477
Without the title of Prince,
you'd be just a nobody.

300
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:37,720
Jin Xiaobao.
I don't mean to look down on you.

301
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,560
But people like you would make no difference
even if you entered society at three.

302
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,160
Even if you're sold,
you would only help them count the money.

303
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
You...

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
I dare you to not fight back!

305
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,060
You two are really in the mood
in such broad daylight.

306
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
Let me go!

307
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Who are you?

308
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,120
Do you know him?

309
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,800
No. He... I...

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,480
- He is...
- I am coming to pick up my man.

311
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,720
Your man?

312
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,320
Who's your man in this mansion?

313
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm dead.

314
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
You...

315
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,160
He's the Miss Zheng
you're talking about, right?

316
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Why is she a man?

317
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,400
I... I've never said that she's a woman.

318
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
Jin Xiaobao.

319
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,300
You won't even let go of a man
as long as he looks pretty?

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,160
- What are you doing?!
- Stop moving!

321
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,600
Huh? Hey!

322
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
Let my brother go now!

323
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,520
Are you okay?

324
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
What are you doing here?

325
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,520
What's going on now?

326
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm warning you. If you destroy
Zhaocai and Jinbao's house,

327
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,880
I won't let you off.

328
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
I am warning you, too.

329
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,520
If you keep opposing me, I'll strip you naked
and tie you to the city gate.

330
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,680
Try me.

331
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,219
Master Jin.

332
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:29,360
- I am here.
- You asked me to pick him up in person.

333
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,280
Now I'm personally here.

334
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,560
Why aren't you letting him go?

335
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,760
Sure.

336
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,320
- Let him go.
- Of course we'll let him go.

337
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,280
Since we've saved your man,
we will surely let him go.

338
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,840
But your subordinate is seriously injured.

339
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,760
If we let him go just like this,
I'm afraid his life might be in danger.

340
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,840
If you blame us later because of this,
I am afraid we can't defend ourselves.

341
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,360
That makes sense.

342
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,240
In that case, I have no choice
but to stay here for a few days.

343
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,400
What do you think, Master Jin?

344
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,112
Step aside. That sounds good.

345
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,080
My pleasure. My pleasure, indeed.

346
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,120
Please be my guest.

347
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
Erm... Zhaocai, Jinbao.

348
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,243
Get a room ready.

349
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:13,640
Yes.

350
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on. Hurry up, hurry up.

351
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
Come on. Change that.

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,748
Change it to a splendid one.

353
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:27,040
Come on, hurry!

354
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
The guest is waiting.

355
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Hey. That lamp. Put it in the right place.

356
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
My Master.

357
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,720
That Miss Zheng...
No... That Mister Huaien...

358
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Isn't he a man?

359
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you really going to marry him?

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Nonsense! How's that possible?

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
That's good.

362
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,397
But I'm going to subdue him.

363
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,802
Subdue him?

364
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,405
That's... a little impossible.

365
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
He's now in my territory.

366
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm the one who has the final say.

367
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,640
Right.

368
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,120
When he is deeply in love with me,
I'll tear him into pieces,

369
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,995
then drag him out to feed the dog.

370
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,440
Xiaobao is getting more and more mischievous.

371
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,760
Fortunately, it was just a false alarm.

372
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,320
That man dressed up as a woman.

373
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,007
So it's also reasonable
that Xiaobao didn't notice it.

374
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,640
He's a dignified man.

375
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
How can he do such an indecent thing?

376
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,600
Anyway, he must have gotten close to Xiaobao
with a motive.

377
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,920
No, I have to kill him
to avoid more troubles.

378
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,800
- Uncle Jin.
- Your Grace.

379
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,120
A secret letter from the Prince of Rites.

380
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,680
Your Grace, what happened?

381
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Grandfather ordered me
to return to Annan immediately.

382
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,920
He said there's something important to discuss.

383
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,320
Uncle Jin.

384
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,480
The identity of that Mister Zheng
is quite special.

385
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm afraid he's going to be trouble.

386
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,600
A word of advice, do not alert the enemy.

387
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,481
Okay. I'll listen to whatever you say.

388
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Back then, I happened to save your father
by chance.

389
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,120
Thanks to that, I'm lucky enough to
be really close friends with your father.

390
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,693
Xiaobao is also lucky enough
to grow up with you, Your Grace.

391
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:48,440
Look at you, Your Grace.

392
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,800
You are young and promising,
and defend Xiaobao in various aspects.

393
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,960
It's really Xiaobao's good fortune.

394
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,320
My father told me a long time ago
that he cannot pay back your great kindness.

395
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,680
We have such a close relationship.
No need to pay back the favor.

396
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,840
In fact, I already see you as
the biological brother of Xiaobao.

397
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,440
Xiaobao is such a useless idiot.

398
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,713
He still has to rely on you in future.

399
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
Xiaobao has a kind nature. He'll surely be safe
and well-off with the blessing of the Jins.

400
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Uncle Jin. I have to take my leave.

401
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,114
Okay. Take your time.

402
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,400
Take care, Your Grace.

403
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,800
Master. Why is the Prince so secretive?

404
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,680
Could Mister Zheng be someone
sent by the emperor?

405
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,320
I don't care who he is.

406
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,780
As long as we have the account books,
we will all be fine.

407
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,040
Dear, don't worry.

408
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,880
But now, Xiaobao is
quite interested in that Mister Huaien.

409
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Didn't he dress up as a woman?
Xiaobao doesn't know it?

410
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,560
Listen, you two.

411
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,960
The identity of that Huaien
is quite special.

412
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,760
Keep a close eye on him. If there's
any problem, report to me immediately.

413
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,080
Yes, sir.

414
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,240
Remember what I said.

415
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,240
What are you secretly talking about?

416
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,120
Xiaobao. I'm leaving for Annan.

417
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,760
- Annan?
- Yes.

418
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,920
Are you going back to your grandfather?

419
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
What happened?

420
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,040
If I told you, are you able to understand?

421
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,320
Of course, I can.

422
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,160
Jin Xiaobao, I am telling you.

423
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,800
The identity of Huaien is special.

424
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,960
He went to Huaizhou with an unknown intention.

425
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,080
And now he lingers by your side.
He must be up to something.

426
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,360
I have ordered Zhaocai and Jinbao
to keep an eye on him.

427
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,560
I'm gone for only a month.

428
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,960
During this period,
you'd better behave well.

429
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Understand?

430
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,120
- Zhaocai, Jinbao.
- Yes.

431
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,000
I've left some skilled fighters here.

432
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
If you meet any trouble,
ask the Su Mansion for help immediately.

433
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
Yes, sir.

434
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,600
A secret letter from Prince of Rites?

435
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,440
What does it say?

436
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,320
The Jin guards are secretive and impenetrable.

437
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,080
There's news from the Lord. Prince Shen
intends to win over Prince of Rites.

438
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,680
The secret letter should be related to this.

439
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,720
Su Yin is preparing to leave,
for the fief of Prince of Rites.

440
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,440
Prince of Rites...

441
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,200
He didn't support his own direct descendants,
but passed the title of Prince to Su Yin.

442
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,120
Even such important matters
have to be discussed with him.

443
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,920
It seems that Su Yin cannot
be underestimated.

444
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,960
How about the account book?

445
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,366
No clue.

446
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,800
- You may leave.
- Yes.

447
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,600
- I am going in.
- Okay.

448
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,800
Miss...

449
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,680
Mister Zheng.

450
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,040
Did you tell anyone
about what happened that day?

451
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,480
What? Is that something worth showing off?

452
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
Good.

453
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,760
You'd better take it to your grave.

454
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,240
Otherwise... you've seen how I kill people.

455
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,640
This is my home.
What are you talking about?

456
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,560
You brute! You really have no conscience.

457
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,720
I came to your rescue out of kindness.
But you treated me like that.

458
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Of course I would be angry with you.

459
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,640
So who are you exactly? Tell me honestly.

460
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,880
- Otherwise, I...
- You what?

461
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,640
I... I...

462
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,240
Actually, I'm not blaming you.

463
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,320
I just felt a little shocked.

464
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,920
I didn't expect that you are a man.

465
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,120
But then, I've been thinking a lot about it.

466
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,640
I believe that the true love
has nothing to do with gender.

467
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,280
I'm already deeply in love with you.

468
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,680
I will never treat you differently
just because you're a man.

469
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,080
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me.

470
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I risked my life to save you.
And you did that to me.

471
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,680
How could I not be angry?

472
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,880
I underdstand. You were unconscious
and couldn't help it.

473
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,280
If you hadn't tried to save me,
you wouldn't have been poisoned.

474
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:50,360
In that case, we actually have sincerely
done something for each other, right?

475
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,778
Are you serious?

476
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:56,720
Are you made of powder?
Would you fall apart if I touched you?

477
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,440
You...

478
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,320
No one in this world can slander my feelings
for your mother, especially you.

479
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,482
We met each other when I was six.

480
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,920
Since then, I have decided to marry no one
but her.

481
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,480
We were deeply in love with each other.

482
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,800
No one could destroy our connection.

483
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Deeply in love?

484
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,360
Then how could she be someone else's wife?!

485
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm already deeply in love with you.

486
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,440
I dare you not to fight back!

487
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,240
- Taste this.
- Okay.

488
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,320
- That's it?
- I am full.

489
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
Son.

490
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,920
I heard that Mister Huaien
has a complex background.

491
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Prince Su asked you not to hang out with him.

492
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,880
Mother. Don't listen to Su Yin.

493
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,480
If there's really something wrong with Huaien,
he wouldn't let him stay here.

494
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,000
Father wouldn't leave him alone, either.

495
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,560
Su Yin has been bullying me since we were kids,
and just wants to make me obey him.

496
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,600
He's downright bad.

497
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,720
But your father also asked you
to be cautious of him.

498
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,400
There are so many skilled fighters
staring at him day and night.

499
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
He is not able to do anything to me.

500
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,560
Why not I send Mister Zhuang
to find a few pretty girls to serve you?

501
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Can you just behave well for the time being?

502
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Maybe next time.

503
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,840
Mother. I'm so tired.

504
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,400
I was in a coma for so many days，,
and haven't recovered now.

505
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,640
Alright. I'll stop talking. Take a rest now.

506
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,720
- Let's talk about it later.
- Alright.

507
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,440
Come here.

508
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,120
Mother. You're the one who treats me best.

509
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,560
Oh, my son. Turn around.

510
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,240
Just one Huaien has wrecked
several elite fighters of mine. It's atrocious!

511
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,000
Please calm down, your Highness.

512
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,960
The Second Prince's army is growing stronger.

513
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,600
His men are dispatched
to all parts of the nation.

514
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Now that the roster is missing,

515
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,600
the Imperial Court cannot
denounce it in public.

516
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,640
We may have to make a long-term plan,
Your Highness.

517
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,200
Send someone to have an audience
with His Majesty now,

518
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,880
to ask His Majesty to make a judgment.

519
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,480
Yes, sir.

520
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,120
Prince.

522
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,960
What do you think of this?

523
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Father. Although Second Uncle
was demoted to a commoner,

524
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,080
he's still my blood-related elder.

525
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,680
So I dare not comment on it presumptuously.

526
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,840
But if uncle still refuses to mend his ways,

527
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,200
I'm afraid it may impact the foundation
of the nation's destiny,

528
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,400
jeopardizing state affairs.

529
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,640
I am supposed to act in the interests
of the people.

530
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm willing to help my fourth uncle.

531
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Your Majesty.
Minister Li is asking for an audience with you.

532
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,000
Approved.

533
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,760
Prince. Go and prepare yourself.

534
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Yes, Father.

535
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Your Highness.

536
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Your Majesty.

537
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,440
Minister.

538
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
You had advised me not to let
the tiger return to the mountain.

539
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,240
Today, that tiger is attempting
to stage a comeback.

540
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,960
Minister. Do you have any solution
to deal with it?
