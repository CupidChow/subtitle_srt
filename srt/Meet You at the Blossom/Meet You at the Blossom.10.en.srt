1
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:43,984
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,800
Sir.

3
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Sir.

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,475
Youying and I begged for a living as children.

5
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,800
If it weren't for you,

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,250
we would have died long ago.

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,850
We struggled to survive to this day.

8
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,970
We have no other desire.

9
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,810
And there is no place for us in the Tong Sect.

10
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,970
We just want to stay with you
and serve you.

11
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,650
Exactly.

12
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,925
I don't need to be served.

13
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,875
I saved you in the first place

14
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,435
because I wanted you to be my servants.

15
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,590
If you don't fight me,

16
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,675
just go away.

17
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,400
Jinbao, they didn't sell you?

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,130
No.

19
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,416
Then why did you run away?

20
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,370
Don't let Jinbao serve him.

21
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,090
If he wants to be served,

22
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,410
I'll do it.

23
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,690
What?

24
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,250
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,050
Young Master,
Dr. Que didn't give me a hard time.

26
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,770
I want to continue to serve him.

27
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,250
It was because…

28
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,383
Your Highness, something went wrong.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,690
A bunch of waste.

30
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,630
Why didn't you stop him?

31
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,936
I'm at your disposal.

33
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,190
Jin Xiaobao,

34
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,450
your ex-lover is coming.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,143
You go back first.

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,600
Su Qi. Let's go.

37
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,683
You want me to teach you a lesson, huh?

38
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,840
Su Yin. We've got four.

39
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,836
Xiaobao,

40
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,890
I'll try to get the rest for you.

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
Looks like you already know I'm poisoned.

42
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll take the flower.

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,450
But if you still have a little conscience,

44
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,560
don't ever show up in front of me.

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
You're poisoned?

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
Xiaobao.

47
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Xiaobao.

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
Xiaobao.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
You are poisoned?

50
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Mom, I'm fine.

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm all right.

52
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
Mom, the miracle doctor is here.

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,080
Don't worry, I'll be fine soon.

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,920
I wondered why you hadn't
gotten rid of your cold.

55
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,410
It's you.

56
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,990
How dare you show up?

57
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,830
Do you want to harm our Jin family again?

58
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,670
What do you want to do to Xiaobao?

59
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,100
Get out of here.

60
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,350
Xiaobao, don't be angry.

61
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,110
I'll find a way to cure you.

62
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,750
Please give me a chance to explain.

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,400
I don't want to hear you explain.

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,875
I just want you to leave me alone.

65
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,595
But I…

66
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,570
I dare you to come closer.

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,040
Su Yin, I don't know

68
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,920
what you're secretly planning to kill me.

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,720
But I'm telling you.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,296
If I can't be with Xiaobao this life,

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,953
I'll bet the rest of my life

72
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:59,920
to destroy the family fortune
your grandfather accumulated over decades.

73
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,120
And I will disrupt the world.

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,840
How dare you?

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,570
Don't come closer.

76
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,600
Are you…

77
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,920
happy now?

78
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,536
- Lord.
- Lord.

79
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,670
Chase them.

80
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,275
Chase them.

81
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:30,955
Yes.

82
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,330
Will he die?

83
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,830
Even if he died,

84
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,525
I killed him.

85
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,025
It has nothing to do with you.

86
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:11,785
No.

87
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,590
I killed him.

88
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,790
Xiaobao.

89
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,390
I killed him.

90
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:24,375
He made my parents lose their home.

91
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,350
He made me suffer from poisoning and this.

92
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:31,945
He separated me from Xiaoyu.

93
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,710
Why can't I kill him?

94
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,070
Why can't I kill him?

95
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,070
Xiaobao.

96
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,710
He sent me the medicine
and told me his feelings.

97
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,570
He said
he would give up his royal status for me.

98
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,950
He lied.

99
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,310
He lied to me.

100
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,870
What did he approach me for?

101
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,510
What does he want?

102
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,910
Xiaobao.

103
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,470
The possession.

104
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,975
The possession.

105
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,375
No.

106
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,150
He's taken the possession from my parents.

107
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,470
What does he want?

108
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,675
Xiaobao.

109
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:22,550
Su Yin,

110
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,910
what does he want from me?

111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,750
Xiaobao, listen to me.

112
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,310
As long as I'm here,

113
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,870
he can't take anything from you.

114
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,070
I promise you.

115
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:35,950
What does he want?

116
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,150
Lord, it's bandaged up.

117
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,830
Get out of here.

118
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,350
Lord.

119
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,030
Get out of here.

120
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,030
Yes.

121
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:51,910
Huai'en.

122
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,030
How dare you come here?

123
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,940
Do you want to die?

124
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,300
I'll kill you.

125
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,780
Kill me if you want.

126
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,891
It's better for me to be killed by you
than to be tortured like this.

127
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,875
Who is torturing whom?

128
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,020
Tell me the truth.

129
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,860
What do you want from me?

130
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,140
You don't need to beat around the bush.

131
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,660
As long as you promise not to hurt my parents,

132
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
I'll give you anything you want.

133
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,670
Xiaobao,

134
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,740
why can't you understand?

135
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,940
All I want is you.

136
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,420
You want me to die.

137
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,700
I won't let you die.

138
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Xiaobao, I'm begging you.

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,780
Please don't push me.

140
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,140
I want to take you to a place

141
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,940
where no one is around and lock you up.

142
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,660
That way,

143
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,400
you'll never see your parents again.

144
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Do you want that?

145
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,140
What's wrong with you?

146
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,540
Why do you want to separate me from my parents?

147
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,340
Do you think that everyone is just like you,

148
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,940
who is not loved by your parents?

149
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,700
You're right.

150
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,460
My parents don't love me.

151
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,060
My mom gave birth to me but didn't raise me.

152
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,700
My father abandoned me.

153
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,050
My foster father ravaged me and abused me

154
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,100
since I was a child.

155
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
And now he's going to kill me.

156
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,620
Why?

157
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,780
I don't understand.

158
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,380
Why?

159
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,100
They cherished my mother.

160
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,740
But

161
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
they despise me.

162
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,871
Did I do something wrong?

163
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:36,940
Why?

164
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,946
Why?

165
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,660
I didn't believe you meant what you said to me.

166
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:54,825
Xiaobao,

167
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,025
because no one had ever been so nice to me
as you were.

168
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,576
Do you know?

169
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,890
Xiaobao.

170
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,343
The world is big.

171
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,521
But there's no place for me.

172
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,740
The time I spent with you

173
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,900
was the best

174
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,825
and most memorable

175
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,020
of my life.

176
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:27,663
Everything before

177
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,300
is a great memory for you,

178
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
but it's a nightmare for me.

179
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,940
You don't know.

180
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,620
Every time the poison strikes,

181
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,980
I can only feel better

182
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,580
if I imagine cutting you into pieces.

183
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,250
So there's no way I'm going to forgive you.

184
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,880
Whether you forgive me or not,

185
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,700
I won't let you go.

186
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,025
It's not that I don't want to.

187
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,505
It's that I can't.

188
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,066
Leave here.

189
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:07,000
You can't deal with Su Yin like this.

190
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,276
There's no way I'm going with you.

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,800
Xiaobao.

192
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,540
Are you worried about me?

193
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm not.

194
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,850
I just want you to stay away from me.

195
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
I will save you.

196
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,025
I will save you.

197
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:26,050
When the time comes,
whether you want it or not,

198
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,323
you will have to come with me.

199
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,010
How could it be you?

200
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,250
Why do you have a Tong Sect thing?

201
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,820
It has nothing to do with you.

202
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,180
The 19th of next month

203
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,460
is the Yang day, the Yang month, the Yang year.

204
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,900
The crimson dahlia on the Chifeng Cliff,

205
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,180
which blooms once every seven years,
will bloom.

206
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,820
The flowering period is two days.

207
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,826
You will have to wait seven years
if you miss it.

208
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,940
If you really want to save Xiaobao,

209
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,300
bring back the crimson dahlia.

210
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,450
Don't bother.

211
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,890
I'll save Xiaobao myself.

212
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,205
I'm warning you, Su Yin.

213
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,225
You'd better not seduce Xiaobao.

214
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,600
Otherwise,

215
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,840
I'll do what I said today.

216
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,250
If you don't believe it, have a try.

217
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,256
What?

218
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,420
He came again?

219
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,580
Keep your voice down.

220
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,025
Well,

221
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,540
what kind of kung fu is he practicing?

222
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,300
He disappears just as quickly as he appears.

223
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,820
Young Master, did you relent to him?

224
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,740
I was afraid.

225
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,740
He never stops until he reaches his goal.

226
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,140
I was afraid he would do something extreme.

227
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,540
Su Yin tried to kill him many times.

228
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,500
Now that I knew he was a prince,

229
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,180
I was afraid that he would hurt Su Yin.

230
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,900
What's wrong, Jinbao?

231
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,375
Young Master,

232
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,220
I feel like you've really grown up.

233
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,130
You wouldn't have thought about that before.

234
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,660
I used to think

235
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,496
that my parents would protect me

236
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,020
even if there was a disaster.

237
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,260
If the worst comes to the worst,

238
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,900
Su Yin would protect me.

239
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,075
I don't want to grow up.

240
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,363
And I'm not willing to grow up.

241
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,780
It's all my fault

242
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,980
where the Jin family is now.

243
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,340
I can't go out.

244
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,060
Listen up, you two.

245
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,580
If something goes wrong,

246
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,140
you must tell me.

247
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Do you understand?

248
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,020
[Prince Shen's Mansion]

249
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,756
Mr. Li,

250
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:41,700
you showed mercy to Huai'en

251
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,421
and saved him several times.

252
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:46,740
You're trying
to earn my second brother's trust, right?

253
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,300
Didn't you really know

254
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,860
that he's the Emperor's son?

255
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,940
I didn't dare to guess.

256
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Have you ever wondered

257
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,851
if my second brother became the Emperor…

258
00:17:58,851 --> 00:17:59,620
No.

259
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,780
With his character,

260
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,260
he can't be the Emperor.

261
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,540
You've been
following my second brother for years.

262
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,100
Did he never suspect you?

263
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,740
He suspected me

264
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,260
all the time.

265
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,340
He never let his guard down on me.

266
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,140
Really?

267
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,500
Then it's getting tougher.

268
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,020
The forces of the Tong Sect
are all over the country.

269
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,460
We didn't swipe them out last time.

270
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,300
Looks like we can't use Huai'en anymore.

271
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,940
No, we can use him.

272
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,780
We can only use Huai'en

273
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,010
to capture the second prince alive.

274
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,195
Do you really want to follow me?

275
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,070
We swear to follow you.

276
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,340
Get up.

277
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,500
Youying.

278
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,580
Yes.

279
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,900
I have to leave Annan for a few days.

280
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,175
After I'm gone,

281
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,375
you have to keep an eye on the Su mansion

282
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,940
and protect Xiaobao secretly.

283
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,425
Yes.

284
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,940
Zuoying.

285
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,425
Yes.

286
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:08,325
You take people to Chifeng Cliff immediately.

287
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,860
The crimson dahlia is going to bloom.

288
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,575
Many people will fight for it.

289
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,860
Su Yin

290
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,540
will definitely find a way to get rid of me
in this fight.

291
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

292
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,180
Do whatever it takes to get the crimson dahlia.

293
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,820
If you run into him later…

294
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,780
Su Yin.

295
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,236
I heard you're going to Yuxia.

296
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,380
Yes.

297
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,620
After the plague,

298
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,060
many things had to be done in Yuxia.

299
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,260
The relief money of the Imperial Court
hasn't been allocated.

300
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,300
The people went on a rampage.

301
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,380
I have to go.

302
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,740
Take care of yourself.

303
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:51,620
Wait for my return.

304
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,700
It's snowing heavily.

305
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,780
I didn't expect you

306
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,580
to keep the bracelet so well.

307
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,460
You're keeping it well, too.

308
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,660
Because it's a token
that we exchanged as children.

309
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,460
It's my most cherished amulet.

310
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,580
Yin.

311
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,780
Yin.

312
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,580
Do you guarantee

313
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,440
that it will be done perfectly?

314
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,675
The crimson dahlia flower is a treasure.

315
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,715
But its stem is toxic.

316
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,875
Picking it can be life-threatening.

317
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,140
I set up an ambush on the cliff.

318
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,776
He won't leave there alive.

319
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:35,900
No.

320
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,780
I have to tell my young master about it.

321
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,460
Sit down.

322
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,820
Isn't it great that he will die?

323
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,940
Your young master can get revenge

324
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,020
and live a good life.

325
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,140
But

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,860
I don't think my young master

327
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,500
wants him dead.

328
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,675
All right.

329
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,940
I'll tell Huai'en not to go there.

330
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,500
If he goes there, he will die.

331
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,650
Hey, sit down.

332
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,700
If he doesn't go to collect it,

333
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
how can we

334
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,620
heal my young master?

335
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,125
So, what do you want to do?

336
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,260
So…

337
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,980
I don't know.

338
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,780
Xiaobao,

339
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,060
I'm leaving for Chifeng Cliff tomorrow.

340
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,310
The crimson dahlia is going to bloom.

341
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,150
Before spring,

342
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,110
I must collect all seven crimson dahlias.

343
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,310
I won't let you suffer this winter.

344
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,470
Xiaobao,

345
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,990
once you're cured,

346
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,870
could you let go of the past?

347
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,750
I can give you everything you want.

348
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,700
All I want is for you to forgive me.

349
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,470
Okay?

350
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,125
You owe me that.

351
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,270
And you should heal me.

352
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,910
Don't blackmail me with that.

353
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:49,875
I won't forgive you.

354
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,000
It's not blackmail.

355
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,110
It's my pleasure to do it for you.

356
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,750
As long as you are happy,
I'd love to give my life to you,

357
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,590
and I'm at your disposal.

358
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,270
But Xiaobao, you know what?

359
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,630
I might die there.

360
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,950
That would be the best.

361
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,710
Anyway, I don't want to see you anymore.

362
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,230
You're lying.

363
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,710
Listen to me.

364
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,350
Even if I die, I won't leave you alone.

365
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,630
You can't get rid of me.

366
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,510
It's the rainy season soon.

367
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:57,765
You will suffer again.

368
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,630
But I was fine on rainy and snowy days before.

369
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,110
That's because the rain and snow
were infrequent.

370
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,390
The moisture did not gather.

371
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,230
And we were all around.

372
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,590
And you studied

373
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,150
the Heart-warming Book well.

374
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,750
So, you barely pressed it down.

375
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,430
But the rainy season is different.

376
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,550
Rain can last for more than ten days.

377
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,590
You can block cold air.

378
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,510
But you can't block moisture.

379
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,310
Although it is not as terrifying as winter,

380
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,075
it's harder to prevent.

381
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,575
What should we do?

382
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,375
His Highness is not here.

383
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,900
Excuse me.

384
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:39,750
What does it matter if he's here?

385
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,500
Who can save Xiaobo?

386
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,150
Me or him?

387
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,150
You.

388
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,270
Miracle doctor,

389
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,310
think of a way.

390
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,390
I can't help it.

391
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,589
Is there a way
to prevent it as much as possible?

392
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,175
Continue to light a fire in the room.

393
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:00,790
It will reduce moisture.

394
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,710
But it's getting hotter.

395
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:04,845
I don't think you can stand it.

396
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,590
However, compared to your poison,

397
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,270
you'd better bear with it.

398
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,325
Young Master, don't be afraid.

399
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:12,910
Zhaocai and I will be with you all the time.

400
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,310
Hey.

401
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,750
Why are you so excited?

402
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,430
I'm not excited. It's not a show.

403
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,950
What if my young master faints from the heat

404
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,390
without me around?

405
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:28,395
I don't know if they can
get the crimson dahlia successfully.

406
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,750
Well.

407
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,270
Didn't Su Yin go to Yuxia?

408
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,110
Young Master, I have something to say to him.

409
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,150
Take a good rest.

410
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:40,250
I'm leaving.

411
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,620
Zhaicai.

412
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,780
Does everyone know

413
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,260
that the crimson dahlia is about to bloom?

414
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,020
Yeah. It's spreading all over the place.

415
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,780
So…

416
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,500
Su Yin also knew it.

417
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,540
Yeah.

418
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,220
His Highness told us about it.

419
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,340
But Su Yin went to Yuxia.

420
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,580
I think he sent someone to get it.

421
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:23,220
How is that possible?

422
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,540
Did Su Yin really go to Chifeng Cliff?

423
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,500
Yeah.

424
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,420
But he said he was going to Yuxia

425
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,940
and had someone dress up like him.

426
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Do you know why?

427
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,740
Why?

428
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,500
Now,

429
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,380
all sorts of people

430
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,140
are rushing to Chifeng Cliff.

431
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,800
There are at least

432
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,025
hundreds of them.

433
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:09,580
It would be easy for Su Yin
to take advantage of the chaos

434
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,590
to get rid of someone.

435
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,620
Look at what you've done.

436
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,300
You were not nice to him

437
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,860
when he came here last time.

438
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,180
Maybe

439
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,660
that was the last time you saw each other.

440
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,620
Su Yin is going to be serious this time.

441
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,860
Why are you telling me this?

442
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,900
I want you to owe me a favor.

443
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,000
Favor?

444
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,500
What favor?

445
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,060
I don't understand.

446
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,660
If Su Yin kills him,

447
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,380
that's exactly what I want.

448
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,580
Zhaocai, come here.

449
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,360
What?

450
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,241
Do you think

451
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,900
his Highness will kill him?

452
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,180
Of course.

453
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,540
What?

454
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,340
Are you worried about him?

455
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,780
I think he's pathetic.

456
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,620
And he doesn't deserve to die.

457
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,260
Our young master is the pathetic one.

458
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,340
Look what he did to our young master.

459
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,950
But I always felt

460
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,620
that he really liked our young master.

461
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,940
Otherwise, why did he give up being a prince

462
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,740
in exchange for pardoning our family?

463
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,820
His Highness said

464
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,660
we couldn't let our young master know about it.

465
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:20,420
You'd better not disturb your young master.

466
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,260
I added a sleeping ingredient

467
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,100
to his medicine last night

468
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,060
in case he couldn't sleep well

469
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,595
and couldn't concentrate

470
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,750
on studying the Heart-warming Book.

471
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,125
If Su Yin knew it,

472
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,725
I would get in trouble.

473
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,780
You're not leaving?

474
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,300
But Xiaobao, you know what?

475
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,140
I might die there.

476
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,375
Didn't you say my young master was sleeping?

477
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,980
Now, my young master is missing.

478
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,030
What's going on?

479
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:17,740
Drug efficacy varies from person to person.

480
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,580
How did I know he was already awake?

481
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,475
You'd better go find him.

482
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,140
If it rains again,

483
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,620
he might die out there.

484
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,188
- You…
- Right.

485
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,700
I forgot.

486
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,900
Your master is not young, is he?

487
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,940
If he knows that Jin Xiaobao is missing,

488
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,151
he will…

489
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,689
Hey, Zhaocai.
What are you doing here?

490
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,749
The young master is missing.

491
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,069
Think of a way to inform His Highness.

492
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,269
Come on. Let's go.

493
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:03,929
Go.

494
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,698
Stop it.

495
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,300
Help.

496
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,540
Help.

497
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:00,416
Are you okay?

498
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,840
Zheng Huai'en,

499
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,380
I must have killed your whole family

500
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,603
and dug up your ancestral graves
in my last life.

501
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,100
That's why

502
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
I've been so unlucky in this life.

503
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:21,740
Jin Xiaobao.

504
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,820
The five of us.

505
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,420
The five of us.

506
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,180
You're going to die here.

507
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,460
You let down your parents.

508
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
You can't repay Su Yin.

509
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,980
And you can't save…

510
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,180
Huai'en.

511
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,540
Xiaobao.

512
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,900
Xiaobao.

513
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,300
Xiaobao.

514
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:05,748
Xiaobao.

515
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:11,105
Xiaobao.

516
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:12,852
You're awake.

517
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:17,680
How did you find me?

518
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,580
I asked my man to keep an eye on Su's Mansion.

519
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,218
He has been following you

520
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:24,522
since you left yesterday.

521
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:26,522
I got the news a few days ago.

522
00:39:26,522 --> 00:39:28,526
So I rushed back.

523
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:29,960
So,

524
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,840
it was you who was after me yesterday.

525
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,760
It was Youying.

526
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,580
I wasn't in Chifeng when I got the news.

527
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,540
But as soon as I got the news, I rushed back.

528
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:41,460
I told Youying not to follow you too close.

529
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,909
But the weather was gloomy.

530
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:44,559
He was worried that you would have a seizure.

531
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,487
So he followed you closely.

532
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:47,740
But

533
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,820
it caused you to go into the woods.

534
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,180
Do you know how worried I was?

535
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,660
When I arrived,

536
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,803
he had already lost you.

537
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:58,900
I looked for you in the woods.

538
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,679
Finally, I found you in a cave.

539
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:09,863
Xiaobao.

540
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,251
Do you know

541
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:13,883
how worried I was about you yesterday?

542
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:16,826
I didn't know what to do.

543
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:18,746
I could only inject inner strength into you.

544
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:19,833
I could only…

545
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:22,018
Luckily, you made it.

546
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:24,884
Luckily, you survived.

547
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:31,896
Xiaobao.

548
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,775
Why did you come here?

549
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:44,655
You came to see me, right?

550
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:48,150
You knew Su Yin was going to kill me, right?

551
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:51,061
I didn't know.

552
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:55,780
I'm here for Su Yin.

553
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
You're here for him?

554
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:02,075
Do you know

555
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:05,263
that he gathered nearly a thousand people
from several sects

556
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,154
and stirred things up?

557
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:08,900
But he hides

558
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,324
and waits to take the credit.

559
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,140
Don't you know that?

560
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,300
You knew it all along?

561
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,740
Since you knew it was a trap,

562
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,100
why did you go there?

563
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,180
Because I told you

564
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:23,140
I would save you

565
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,180
even if I died.

566
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,940
You gave up being a prince

567
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,085
in exchange for pardoning my family.

568
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,220
Why didn't you tell me about that?

569
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:56,759
Sir.

570
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,202
Sir.

571
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:00,122
Here they come.

572
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,380
The man you were looking for
is here to pick you up.

573
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,564
I leave for Chifeng Cliff.

574
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:11,980
Wait. Could you stay? I…

575
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,436
I know.

576
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,740
You're here for me.

577
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
It's okay if you don't admit it.

578
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,020
I don't care.

579
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,420
Jin Xiaobao,

580
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,940
use you head.

581
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,900
You.

582
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,420
Take off your clothes

583
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,300
and put them on for him.

584
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:09,971
Let's go.
