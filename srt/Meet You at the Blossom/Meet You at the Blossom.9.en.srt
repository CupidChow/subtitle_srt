[Meet You atf the Blossom]

17
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,280
Xiaobao, I finally found you.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
I missed you so much.

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,660
How dare you show up again?

20
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,180
Get out of here!

21
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,460
- Somebody. Zhaocai, Jinbao. 
 - Xiaobao.

22
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,700
I know you're mad at me.

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,440
But I did that for a reason.

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Let me explain, Xiaobao.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,140
I don't want to hear it.

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,300
You promised me

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,240
that you would forgive me for whatever I did wrong.

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,886
Have you forgotten?

29
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,820
You just lost your money.

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,420
Why can't you forgive me?

31
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,230
Xiaobao, please rest assured.

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,150
From now on, we can be together forever.

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,830
We'll live together.

34
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,250
I promise I'll give you everything

35
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,930
you had before, okay?

36
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,370
This headband

37
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,690
was from you.

38
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm wearing it all the time.

39
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,770
You, too.

40
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,460
Do you think you're the only one who can lie?

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,360
I can also lie. I'm telling you.

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,080
I lied to you before.

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,840
And I won't forgive you.

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,080
Do you understand, Zongzheng Huai'en?

45
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,225
Why?

46
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,740
Why do you always break your promises?

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,750
You think I did something wrong.

48
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,870
You did wrong things, too.

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,650
I forgave you.

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,690
Why can't you forgive me?

51
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,830
You've been with Su Yin all this time.

52
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,970
Are you in love with him?

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,590
Don't insult Su Yin.

54
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,410
Do you think he's the same as you?

55
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,410
Su Yin is much better than you.

56
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,870
Lord, we are spotted. Su Yin is back.

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,970
We must get out of here as soon as possible.

58
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,350
Su Yin, save me.

59
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,450
Do you want to kill me?

60
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,150
You wanted to kill me first.

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,290
Zongzheng Huai'en, don't fake it.

62
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,130
I know why you're here.

63
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,190
I'm telling you.

64
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,410
If you hurt my parents,

65
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,470
I will skin you alive and cut you into pieces.

66
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,350
They're your parents. I won't hurt them.

67
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,810
Lord, we have to leave.

68
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm telling you…

69
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,670
Come to the Yuelian Inn

70
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,550
in the north of the city alone tomorrow.

71
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,490
And I'll let your parents go.

72
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,290
- Young Master. 
 - Xiaobao.

73
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,450
Are you okay?

74
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,310
What did he do to you?

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,810
He…

76
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,470
What's wrong?

77
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,770
What did he do to you?

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,790
Nothing.

79
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,390
He gave me the third degree
to find out where my possessions were.

80
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,890
You came back before he did anything.

81
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,130
Really?

82
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,590
It's him who took my parents, right?

83
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,530
Don't worry.

84
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,110
I've already sent someone to follow him.

85
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,350
We'll find your parents.

86
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,756
Uncle, let me kill him.

87
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,050
Uncle.

88
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,856
Your Royal Highness, he was poisoned.

89
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,610
There's no cure for it.

90
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,990
Why take the trouble to do that?

91
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,510
If I don't kill him,

92
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,543
I can't ease my irritation.

93
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:59,230
Our goal is Zongzheng Huai'en.

94
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,000
Put this on him.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,730
- What's that? 
 - It's Gu poison.

96
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,000

99
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,730
Where are my parents?

100
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,130
They're in a safe place.

101
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,050
You're lying again.

102
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,550
I'm not lying.

103
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,450
Xiaobao, come with me.

104
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,830
We'll go to a place where there's no one.

105
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,675
Let's go to an otherworldly place, okay?

106
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,170
We'll go there with your parents.

107
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,290
Didn't you want me to love you before?

108
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,510
I didn't know what love was.

109
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,783
But now I know.

110
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,685
I love you.

111
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,940
I want to be with you forever.

112
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,900

Jin Xiaobao.

114
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,150
I've told a lot of people that I love them.
But I never meant it.

115
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,550
Zongzheng Huai'en. You ruin my Jin family.

116
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,581
You deserve to get to where you are today.

117
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,250
I don't owe you anything.

118
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,070
What?

119
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,090
How dare you say that?

120
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,090
What about the vows you made to me?

121
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,390
You said you'd protect me. You said you'd love me.

122
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,990
You said that no matter what I did wrong, you'd forgive me.

123
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,130
Have you forgotten all about it?

124
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,310

125
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,210

Believe it or not, I can kill you right now.

130
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,030
I believe it.

131
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,535

But I can't figure it out.

133
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,690

and not know who's ruling the country.

189
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,730
Is it you, my brother?

190
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:19,530
A man who cheated with his sister-in-law should not talk about it.

191
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,010
Brother.

192
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,990
A woman who cheated on her husband

193
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,370
turned you against your brother

194
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,010
and the entire royal family.

195
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,670
You call me brother.

196
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,150
- I don't dare answer. 
 - Shut up.

197
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,790
If you speak ill of Tongen again,

198
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,130
I'll kill you.

199
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,950
What?

200
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,930
Can't I judge her?

201
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,650
When she secretly released you from prison,

202
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,130
our brother didn't pursue you.

203
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,070
Our brother loved her and you.

204
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,550
But you cheated with her and gave birth to this bastard.

205
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,290
Now, you are trying
to disintegrate Zongzheng's reign.

206
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,430
You don't deserve to be a Zongzheng descendant.

207
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,476
Nonsense.

208
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,710
Your Highness.

209
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,050
Tongen and I suppressed our passion for the sake of propriety.

210
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,570
I loved her.

211
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,200
And I respected her.

212
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,590
We never did anything out of line.

213
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,750
Tongen was decent.

214
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,950
She abided by her virtue.

215
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,050
She hadn't seen me

216
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,890
since she married Zongzheng Yunlian.

217
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,850
But Zongzheng Yunlian
listened to the Queen's words

218
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,225
and put her in the doghouse.

219
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,730
She didn't even have a thick quilt
when she gave birth.

220
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,625
In the end, she was killed

221
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,930
and died with a grievance.

222
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,424
Can't I avenge her?

223
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,770
You must die today.

224
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,850
You will all die.

225
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,770
Your Royal Highness,

226
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,490
calm down.

227
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,930
We must kill Zongzheng Huai'en.

228
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,090
He could really be…

229
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,570
Shaoyu, listen to me.

230
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,530
My brother will find out about today
sooner or later.

231
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,970
You can't kill Huai'en today.

232
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,450
Even if you can kill him,

233
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,970
you will pay for it.

234
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,410
Your Highness, we found Mr. and Mrs. Jin.

235
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,150
Retreat.

236
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,325
Go.

237
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,185
Go.

238
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,976
Your Highness, they were prepared.

239
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,122
We need to be careful.

240
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,675
Go.

241
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,330
Did you find the Jin's possessions?

242
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,490
You can forget about how I raised you.

243
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,810
But you can't forget
about your mother giving you life.

244
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,770
I did this

245
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
to avenge your mother.

246
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,890
You coveted a married woman.

247
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,170
It was your own shamelessness
that killed my mother.

248
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,930
But you accused me and took it out on me.

249
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,530
You are a selfish,

250
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,090
shameless,

251
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,863
hypocritical, and despicable coward.

252
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,170
How dare you?

253
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,330
Master.

254
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:17,970
Lord.

255
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,610
To save our lord,

256
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,930
our master lost a good opportunity

257
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,970
to catch Prince Shen
and the Crown Prince alive.

258
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,850
He's not ruthless.

259
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,750
Out of the way.

260
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,370
Don't talk nonsense.

261
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,010
Thinking that you are Zongzheng Yunlian's son

262
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,970
makes me want to skin you

263
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,775
and cut you into pieces.

264
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,890
But your mother is Tongen.

265
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,850
I should have strangled you a long time ago.

266
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,090
You're ungrateful.

267
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,305
I know it.

268
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,010
Master, please think twice.

269
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,810
Master.

270
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,210
Get out of the way.

271
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,130
I have to kill him today.

272
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,650
Master.

273
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,770
Something is going wrong.

274
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,570
Prince Li has found the base of the Tong Sect.

275
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,070
He's attacking.

276
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,970
No.

277
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,890
Master, they made a diversion.

278
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,175
We have to go back right now.

279
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,250
Master, let's focus on the big picture.

280
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,370
Master, we'll go after the lord.

281
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,390
We'll bring the lord back to you.

282
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,050
Go.

283
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,850
Li Gongxiang.

284
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,050
You tricked me into working with Su Yin.

285
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,016
But it was not for catching Huai'en.

286
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,650
You knew my second brother would come.

287
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,030
You made me provoke him

288
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,690
so he could tell everyone who Huai'en was.

289
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,250
You knew it, right?

290
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,010
What are you up to?

291
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,350
I didn't know it.

292
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,330
His Majesty pays my salary,

293
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,050
and I serve His Majesty.

294
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,090
You don't know?

295
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,890
You helped Huai'en out many times.

296
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,076
Who's paying your salary?

297
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,725
Who are you serving?

298
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,400
Your Highness,

299
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,320
since I became the Emperor's studying companion

300
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,520
at the age of twelve,

301
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,800
my life's pursuit

302
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,880
has been to serve the Emperor.

303
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,080
But you were my second brother's best friend.

304
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,480
A straight foot
is not afraid of a crooked shoe.

305
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,640
If you don't trust me,

306
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,320
you can go to the Emperor

307
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,175
and request the Emperor to investigate me.

308
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,120
That's what you want, right?

309
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,640
I've already sent someone to His Majesty.

310
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
Come on.

311
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,560
Mr. Li has not recovered.

312
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,390
Take him down to rest.

313
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,240
Send more people

314
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,880
to serve him.

315
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,639
Who are you?

316
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,680
Let me ask you something.

317
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,600
What kind of poison did you give Jin Xiaobao?

318
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,659
Is there a cure?

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,600
Who are you?

320
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,325
Do you know who I am?

321
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,240
Beat him.

322
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,640
I'll tell you.

323
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,860
Crimson dahlia.

324
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,600
Seven crimson dahlias

325
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,550
will cure Jin Xiaobao.

326
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:05,855
Your Highness, Mr. Qi wants to see you.

327
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Does he have any other poison to offer me?

328
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
The Crown Prince beat him up somehow.

329
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,320
He's badly injured.

330
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,600
He wants you to make things right for him.

331
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
Your Highness,

332
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,225
what do we do?

333
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
He's not dead?

334
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:46,400
Where are you taking me?

335
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,533
I want to see the Prince.

336
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,320
Stop it.

337
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,480
Stop it.

338
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,800
Stop it.

339
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,400
Dear, you suffered.

340
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,280
Dad.

341
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,920
Xiaobao.

342
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,560
Xiaobao.

343
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,920
Xiaobao, are you okay?

344
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,120
It's great that you're okay.

345
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,200
We're fine.

346
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,225
We're fine.

347
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:36,185
Sit down.

348
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:36,834
Mom.

349
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:37,920
Dad.

350
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,818
Sit down.

351
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,160
Xiaobao,

352
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,320
you look terrible.

353
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Do you still have a cold?

354
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,760
It's okay.

355
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,300
I'll be fine in a while.

356
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,040
But

357
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,240
you've suffered all this time.

358
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,240
It's all right.

359
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,625
All they wanted was my money.

360
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,050
They wanted me to give it to them.

361
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,840
I've figured it out.

362
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,900
Money will come and go.

363
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,440
Right, dear?

364
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
Yes.

365
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,480
I just hope they take good care of Xiaoyu.

366
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,592
Yeah.

367
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,680
Those things are a burden for us.

368
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,400
Having it worries us every day.

369
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,280
Why bother?

370
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,600
We don't need to worry now.

371
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,150
We don't have to think about it.

372
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,430
We can live at ease.

373
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,087
Yeah.

374
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,440
Dad,

375
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,912
when spring comes,

376
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:38,040
I will borrow money from Su Yin.

377
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,320
We can open a grain shop or a cloth shop.

378
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,560
It would be great if we can make ends meet.

379
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,080
We can't rely on the Su family forever.

380
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Dear,

381
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,127
Xiaobao seemed to grow up overnight.

382
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,320
But we owe the Su family

383
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,960
more and more.

384
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll pay them back.

385
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,440
From the day Su Yin saved me,

386
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,106
I owe him a great favor.

387
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,440
I will repay him.

388
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:12,120
Master,

389
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,922
Madame,

390
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
you have Jinbao and I.

391
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,520
We'll support you.

392
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,040
Great.

393
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,520
Well.

394
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,080
Why didn't his Highness come?

395
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,280
He has company.

396
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,120
Company?

397
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,175
As long as you kill Huai'en for me,

398
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,800
I'll give you my crimson dahlia.

399
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
I really have one.

400
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
My mother gave it to me.

401
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,840
My grandfather has agreed
to cooperate with Prince Shen

402
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,880
in exterminating the Tong Sect.

403
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,160
Huai'en is an important part of it.

404
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,040
And we don't know who he really is.

405
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,480
If something goes wrong
and the Emperor pursues it,

406
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,760
what should I do?

407
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,400
If we keep it between us,

408
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
no one will know it.

409
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,080
The Tong Sect is evil.

410
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,040
We can cast the blame on their enemies.

411
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,480
As long as you agree,

412
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,960
I will order someone

413
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,620
to get the crimson dahlia for you now.

414
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,600
On August 8, the year of Geng Xu,

415
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,920
the Jin family fell,

416
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,240
and the whole family was put in prison.

417
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,967
Jin Xiaobao was pricked
with the Wangu Poison Needle

418
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,480
in the prison.

419
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
The person who gave him the needle

420
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,840
was Qi Xiaobin,
the son of the Yunyang County official.

421
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,320
Wangu Poison Needle

422
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,976
is made from 48 kinds of deadly poisons.

423
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,036
The needle penetrates into every bone joint.

424
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,920
People can't stand

425
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,480
being pricked by the needle.

426
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,640
And people can't bear the pain

427
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,280
of poisoning.

428
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,720
When the weather is bad,

429
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
the poisoned people

430
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,000
will be in excruciating pain,

431
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,000
like being bitten by countless ants.

432
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,313
They will wish they were dead

433
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,280
until they fester

434
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,800
and lose consciousness.

435
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
The only cure

436
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:55,085
is seven crimson dahlias,
which are the best medicine in the world.

437
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,120
The crimson dahlia grows on Chifeng Cliff.

438
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,000
It blooms once every seven years.

439
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,400
The flower doesn't rot for years.

440
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
Its flower is a treasure.

441
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,650
But its stem is toxic.

442
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,506
They are mutually generative and restrictive.

443
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,293
It's hard to find one.

444
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,379
What are you doing?

445
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:24,686
I'm threading a needle.

446
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,080
Here.

447
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,025
Is it dirty?

448
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:38,228
It's hot.

449
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,246
Young Master.

450
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:44,080
Stop writing.

451
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,920
Here's a freshly roasted sweet potato.
Taste it.

452
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,840
Come on.

453
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,862
Stop writing.

454
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,120
Look at your face.

455
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,760
Zhaocai, look at his face.

456
00:33:58,073 --> 00:33:59,866
Your face is stained

457
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,286
from roasting sweet potatoes.

458
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,150
Young Master,

459
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,050
look at your face.

460
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,210
My face?

461
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,500
You did it, didn't you?

462
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,240
Don't run.

463
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,600
No, Young Master.

464
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,280
Xiaobao, you're not healed yet.

465
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,225
Don't fool around.

466
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,075
Come on.

467
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,800
Don't run.

468
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,120
Xiaobao, stop fooling around.

469
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Xiaobao, stop fooling around.

470
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,720
Pay attention to your health.

471
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,200
Stop it.

472
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,160
Xiaobao, stop it.

473
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,240
Be careful.

474
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,600
Xiaobao.

475
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,528
Young Master.

476
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,688
Don't bully me.

477
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,640
Be careful.

478
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,600
Be careful.

479
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,625
Stop.

480
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:23,080
Who are you?

481
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
Why are you following me?

482
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,382
We have what you're looking for.

483
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,200
Father,

484
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,880
please spare my mother

485
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,525
for the sake of you
being husband and wife for years.

486
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,900
You've seen me.

487
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,160
And we've had blood tests.

488
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,750
Can I have that now?

489
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,975
Huai'en.

490
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,449
What are you going to do?

491
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,288
What am I going to do?

492
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,646
You killed my mother.

493
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:16,126
Do you want me
to go back to the palace with you

494
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:17,425
and make me the crown prince?

495
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,305
Huai'en.

496
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,480
Your mother is dead.

497
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,125
There is no need

498
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,733
to discuss the matter.

499
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,080
My second brother

500
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,600
is paranoid.

501
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,200
I think you must have

502
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,080
suffered a lot over the years.

503
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
Go back to the palace with me.

504
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,120
I'll make it up for you.

505
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,360
You want to use me

506
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,000
to deal with Zongzheng Yuzhan, right?

507
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You'd better forget it.

508
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,120
I won't let him use me.

509
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,640
I won't let you use me either.

510
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
If you really want to make it up to me,

511
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,560
let the Jin family go.

512
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,520
They are innocent.

513
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
Mr. Li.

514
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,121
Yes.

515
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,080
I'll leave it to you.

516
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,480
Yes.

517
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,993
Wait.

518
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:04,625
You may leave.

519
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,040
Do what you want to do.

520
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,560
He's like her.

521
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,840
Right?

522
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,040
They look exactly the same.

523
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,960
Lihan.

524
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,480
Yes.

525
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,560
Brother, what can I do for you?

526
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,425
Send someone to secretly protect Huai'en.

527
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,240
Don't let him find out.

528
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,760
Yes.

529
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,900
[Jinqi Mountain]

530
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,880
U-u-uncle.

531
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,100
Su Yin.

532
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,753
Is my family really pardoned?

533
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,680
I'm not dreaming, am I?

534
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,075
It hurts.

535
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,205
It hurts, right?

536
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:18,560
Su Yin, how did you do it?

537
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,840
The Imperial Court just let us go?

538
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,106
They really won't pursue us?

539
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:25,885
I told you

540
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,425
you were deluded

541
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:30,125
and you were not guilty of capital crimes.

542
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,365
His Majesty is righteous.

543
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:32,565
So he let you go.

544
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,770
Great. I'll tell my parents

545
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,390
that we can open our own shop.

546
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,830
Su Yin, I'll give you all the money I make.

547
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,950
Stop it.

548
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,750
People you need to support
are lined up from Annan to Huaizhou.

549
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,030
I'm only one of them.

550
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,670
Help.

551
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,030
Help.

552
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,110
Dr. Que and Zhaocai are fighting.

553
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,070
Let's go.

554
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,910
Besides Jin Xiaobao, he only listens to you.

555
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,734
Who will hide him except you?

556
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,430
He was with you.

557
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,000
But you are asking me where he is.

558
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,270
Hey.

559
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,790
Stop.

560
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,990
What's wrong with you?

561
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,710
Su Yin, it's great that you're here.

562
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,030
We had a deal.

563
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,870
But he hid Jinbao.

564
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,670
I won't keep my promise.

565
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,390
Your Highness,

566
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,230
Jinbao left because he bullies him.

567
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,950
What's going on? What did you do to Jinbao?

568
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,310
He's with him every day.

569
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,870
Did you see him bullying him?

570
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,590
Jinbao is plump.

571
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,670
If you sell him by weight,

572
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,070
he's worth a lot of money.

573
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,190
Did you sell Jinbao?

574
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,070
Give Jinbao back to me.
Give Jinbao back to me.

575
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,750
Give Jinbao back to me.

576
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,750
Stop.

577
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:47,850
Jinbao is back.

578
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,990
What are you doing here?

579
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,730
What did Zongzheng Yuzhan
order you to do to Xiao Bao?

580
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,590
- Lord.
- Lord.

581
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,470
I am no longer your lord.

582
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,625
Sir,

583
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,545
we're here for you.

584
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,550
If you want to kill me,
just do it.
