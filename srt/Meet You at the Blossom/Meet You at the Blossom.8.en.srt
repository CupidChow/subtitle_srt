00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:43,275
[Meet You at the Blossom]

2
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,000
Looks like it's not a good time.

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,080
When did you get here?

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
What kind of poison did you get?

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Why did you ask me to treat you?

6
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,760
It's the Wangu Poison Needle.

7
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
We'll do it ourselves.

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,640
I said we'd do it ourselves.

9
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,520
Su Yin.

10
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
We haven't seen each other in a few years.

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
How did you become so noisy?

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Give me your hand.

13
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,080
What's wrong?

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,760
I forgot to tell you

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,680
that it hurts.

16
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,400
All your joints are pricked with needles.

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,420
Be prepared.

18
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,480
The first rain in the mid-autumn is coming.

19
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
At that time,

20
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
the poison will take full effect.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,640
It seems that the poisoner

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,520
picked a great time.

23
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
Don't talk nonsense.

24
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Can you cure him or not?

25
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
I can't.

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Let him wait to die.

27
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:37,905
What?

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
Get your hand off me.

29
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,600
If you want to cure him,

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,620
you have to collect seven crimson dahlias.

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,920
Crimson what?

32
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,480
Crimson dahlia

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
is the most precious herb.

34
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,880
It grows on Chifeng Cliff.

35
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,320
It blooms only once every seven years,

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
with only one flower at a time.

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
It's very dangerous to collect it.

38
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
And

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,660
even if you collect seven crimson dahlias,

40
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,340
you will only be able to cure him

41
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,400
on seven consecutive sunny days before spring.

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,840
If one raindrop falls,

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,400
your work will be wasted.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
That's why I said I couldn't cure him.

45
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,050
Is there really only one way?

46
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,850
Of course.

47
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,710
Give me some time.

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,350
I'll find it.

49
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,470
Wait till you get it.

50
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,910
Hey.

51
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,310
You can't leave.

52
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,150
You said you'd pay me back.

53
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,870
Su Yin,

54
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,310
I've done you a favor by coming here.

55
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,870
Don't push your luck.

56
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,870
No one can cure him

57
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,070
without crimson dahlias.

58
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,230
At least you can reduce the pain for him.

59
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,430
I have a lot of work to do.

60
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,630
You can ask for anything.

61
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,310
It's not negotiable.

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,006
Your Highness, how is my young master?

63
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,110
Your Highness.

64
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,125
Your Highness.

65
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:39,805
Your Highness.

66
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:42,415
How is my young master?

67
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,450
You.

68
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,490
Stop.

69
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,830
Don't be rude to Dr. Que.

70
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,030
Su Yin.

71
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,430
You want me to stay, don't you?

72
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,510
Okay, I want him.

73
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:10,725
What?

74
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,250
Jinbao.

75
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes.

76
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Don't be nervous.

77
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,310
Jinbao,

78
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,070
the miracle doctor has great medical skills.

79
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,110
But he's eccentric.

80
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,030
He didn't want to stay and treat Xiaobao.

81
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,830
However,

82
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,710
he agrees to stay

83
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,150
as long as you are willing to serve him.

84
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,030
You've been

85
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,830
serving your young master.

86
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,230
Now, you have a chance to repay him.

87
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,590
Would you like to serve him

88
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,350
for the sake of your young master's life?

89
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,390
I'd like to.

90
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,950
My young master treats me well.

91
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,390
I'm willing to do anything for him.

92
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,590
Hey.

93
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,390
By the way,

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,470
the miracle doctor has some hobbies.

95
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,950
You have to bear with him.

96
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,150
Don't offend him.

97
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,950
Don't worry, Your Highness.

98
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,790
Aside from kung fu,

99
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,150
I'm the best at serving people.

100
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,390
I promise to serve him well

101
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,670
so he will cure my young master.

102
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,230
I volunteered to serve the miracle doctor.

103
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,350
I wasn't forced.

104
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,070
Really?

105
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,950
Really.

106
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,870
Dr. Que appreciates my talents.

107
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,350
Your talents?

108
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,790
I'm the best at serving people in the world.

109
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,510
He's eccentric.

110
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,510
What if he beats you?

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,310
Young Master.

112
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,630
I don't care.

113
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,430
I'm okay with it.

114
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,030
What if he has some quirks?

115
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,870
You're dull.

116
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,670
What if he treats you…

117
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,830
Come on.

118
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,950
Do you think Que Siming
is some kind of bad guy?

119
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,270
He just lacked someone he liked

120
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,750
to serve him.

121
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,550
Although Jinbao is not intelligent,

122
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,830
he looks good.

123
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,790
Why did he suddenly agree to stay?

124
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,310
Su Yin, did you promise him anything?

125
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,430
There's no point in him staying.

126
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,710
Without a cure,

127
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,070
how can he cure me?

128
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,990
You can't make a silk purse…

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,350
You can't make a silk purse out of a cow's ear.

130
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,910
Yeah.

131
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,070
You can't make a silk purse…

132
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,390
Out of a sow's ear.

133
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,950
What?

134
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,790
All right.

135
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,750
I let Que Siming stay

136
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,470
because I have a way to find dahlias.

137
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,150
You just have to trust me

138
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,110
like you used to.

139
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,670
But dahilas are hard to get.

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,030
How can you get them for me?

141
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,630
I have no money at all.

142
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,190
I can't pay you.

143
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,230
Do you want to talk about it?

144
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,230
Okay.

145
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,510
From now on,

146
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,830
you must call me Brother.

147
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,390
And you must listen to me.

148
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,390
If I tell you to go to the east,

149
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,150
you can't go to the west.

150
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,910
I'll find some pretty girls for you in Annan.

151
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,630
You will marry them

152
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,190
and settle down.

153
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,270
Your children

154
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,390
will be my servants.

155
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,230
How about it?

156
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,630
You can pay your medicine fee this way.

157
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,670
Mr. and Mrs. Jin,

158
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,670
the Imperial Court is pursuing you.

159
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,270
The priest of Zangke Temple
is my grandfather's best friend.

160
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,350
You can go there.

161
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,710
The people of the Imperial Court
won't go there.

162
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,030
You can live in peace.

163
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,620
Your Highness.

164
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,850
Thank you very much.

165
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,150
Mr. Jin,

166
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,990
don't mention it.

167
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,990
Don't mention it.

168
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,790
Xiaobao, why don't you come with us?

169
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,790
Mom, Dr. Que is here.

170
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,030
He is developing a cure for asthma.

171
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,310
I have to stay and work with him.

172
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,190
Dad. Mom.

173
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,710
Don't worry.

174
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,710
I'll be fine

175
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,270
with Su Yin here.

176
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,910
Yes.

177
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,110
Xiaobao will be fine

178
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,550
with me around.

179
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,750
Thank you, Your Highness.

180
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,025
Let's go.

181
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,100
Dear.

182
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,910
Xiaobao.

183
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,390
Xiaobao.

184
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Go.

185
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,550
Go.

186
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,190
Xiaobao.

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Go.

188
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,910
Xiaobao.

189
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,790
Young Master.

190
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,150
Xiaobao.

191
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,270
Come on.

192
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,070
Help him up.

193
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,790
Young Master.

194
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,830
Xiaobao.

195
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,950
Young Master.

196
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,830
Young Master.

197
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,550
Young Master, look at me.

198
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,910
Xiaobao, hang in there.

199
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
Young Master.

200
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,830
Come on.

201
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,710
Young Master.

202
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,630
Hand.

203
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,390
Young Master.

204
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,630
Here.

205
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,350
Xiaobao.

206
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,030
Come on.

207
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,630
Hand.

208
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,830
Young Master.

209
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,769
Xiaobao.

210
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,710
Hold on, Young Master.

211
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,725
Bite it, Xiaobao.

212
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,590
Bite it, Xiaobao.

213
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,950
Bite it.

214
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,030
Young Master.

215
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,630
- Young Master.
- Bear with it.

216
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,470
Look at you.

217
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,190
I know your bark is worse than your bite.

218
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,710
Young Master.

219
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,910
Young Master.

220
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,030
Xiaobao.

221
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,830
Huai'en.

222
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,150
Save it.

223
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,030
It is made of ancient fine iron.

224
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,630
You can't break it.

225
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,670
You've been stubborn since childhood.

226
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,870
How about this?

227
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,910
It's okay if you don't want to get married.

228
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,750
But I need you to do one last thing.

229
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,750
Some of Jin's possessions are hidden.

230
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,630
Only Jin Bao knows where they are.

231
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,110
You help me find their property,

232
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,590
and I will set you free.

233
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,270
Let's not say you're not trustworthy.

234
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,230
Even if you meant it,

235
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,390
I won't Xiaobao anymore.

236
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,423
Do you know

237
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,390
where the Jin family is now?

238
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,310
They are in Annan.

239
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,910
It's the fiefdom of my third uncle, Prince Li.

240
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,990
Su Yin helped him
escape the Imperial Court's pursuit.

241
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,870
He is now under Su Yin's protection.

242
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,830
However,

243
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,190
it's not that hard

244
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,830
if I want to take his life.

245
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,630
How dare you.

246
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,390
Even if Su Yin can protect him now,

247
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,870
he can't protect him forever.

248
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,710
What if you could get out of here?

249
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,710
Can you help him
escape the pursuit of the Tong Sect?

250
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:42,296
Son,

251
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,825
a wise man submits to circumstances.

252
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,790
I've given you the best option.

253
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
Or

254
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,790
do you want to spend
the rest of your life in jail

255
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,150
and never see Jin Xiaobao again?

256
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,270
A little higher.

257
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,270
Be careful.

258
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,110
Come on.

259
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,070
- Put it there.
- Okay.

260
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,150
Be careful.

261
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,230
Let me.

262
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,630
The weather gets colder with the autumn rains.

263
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,030
He must stay in his room.

264
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,350
And you should keep his room warm.

265
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,510
Su Yin,

266
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,950
use your internal energy
to unclog the circulation of qi and blood

267
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,430
throughout his joints every three days.

268
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,350
Can we stop the poison
from taking effect this way?

269
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,270
It can only relieve his pain
and shorten its duration.

270
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,150
This is just to buy you time

271
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,470
to find dahlias.

272
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,070
Be careful.

273
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,150
Come on. Here.

274
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,710
Young Master,

275
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,310
are you all right?

276
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,070
I'm fine.

277
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,470
Seize the time
to study this Heart-warming Book.

278
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,110
It will keep you awake

279
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,350
when the poison kicks in.

280
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,710
We will help you externally.

281
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,225
With internal and external forces,

282
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,065
you will feel much better.

283
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,990
It hurts so much.

284
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,990
I don't know if I can make it.

285
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,310
Jin Xiaobao.

286
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,590
Who is Huai'en?

287
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,425
Que Siming.

288
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:05,950
You were in a lot of pain last night.

289
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,450
But you kept shouting his name.

290
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,130
Maybe thinking about him
will keep you conscious.

291
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,975
What's your relationship with him?

292
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:16,935
You and him…

293
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,310
Come on.

294
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,390
Don't talk about it.

295
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,150
Get out, get out. Get out.

296
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,450
Get out.

297
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,830
Su Yin, I swear

298
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,750
that is the last time I think of him.

299
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,250
He ruined my home,

300
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,570
and he put me where I am now.

301
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,330
The more I think of him,

302
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,450
the more I hurt.

303
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,375
The more I hurt,

304
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
the more I hate him.

305
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,750
But I promise

306
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,260
that's the last time I think of him.

307
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,275
Trust me.

308
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,460
He's not worth it.

309
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,020
It's all right.

310
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,060
You can think of him

311
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,980
or hate him.

312
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,580
You can do whatever you want

313
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,380
as long as you're happy.

314
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,500
I don't want to think of him.

315
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,255
Then, do your best to hate him.

316
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,450
I got it from my grandfather.

317
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,025
It has been seven years since it was picked.

318
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,265
But it's not rotten at all.

319
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,220
What an amazing flower.

320
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
Xiaobao, it's great.

321
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:41,500
In addition to this one,

322
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,940
my dad found one for me.

323
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,688
There's one in the palace.

324
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:48,625
And the Tang Sect has one.

325
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,625
I'm sure we'll collect all seven soon.

326
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,980
You're so nice to Jin Xiaobao.

327
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,660
Does he have something on you?

328
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,340
No one is like you.

329
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,980
I thought we were the same.

330
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,180
- I thought you and him…
- Yin.

331
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,100
Yin.

332
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,700
Yin.

333
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,180
Your Royal Highness.

334
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,340
It's not appropriate.

335
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:24,740
Yin, I told you

336
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,300
that you don't have to call me
Your Royal Highness

337
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,980
if there are no other people around.

338
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,365
It's not appropriate to say your name.

339
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,791
I am the Crown Prince.

340
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,305
I say it's appropriate.

341
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,180
Just call me by my name.

342
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,700
Call me by my name, Yin.

343
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,340
Call me by my name.

344
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,140
All right. Shaoyu.

345
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,260
Shaoyu, you…

346
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
Please let go of me.

347
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,540
No.

348
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,940
I want to hold you a little longer.

349
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,620
Yin.

350
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,000
We haven't seen each other in three years.

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,480
Don't you miss me?

352
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,500
What are you doing here?

353
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,420
Because I miss you.

354
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,420
Nonsense.

355
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,540
How can you leave Linjing
without His Majesty's authorization?

356
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,220
Well,

357
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,380
I'll send someone to escort you back.

358
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,020
No.

359
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,300
Have you seen our grandpa?

360
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,180
I'm not here to see him.

361
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,980
Why do I have to go see him?

362
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,980
The mansion hasn't changed at all.

363
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,370
It's the same as when we were kids.

364
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,500
Yin,

365
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,620
I want to stay in my old courtyard.

366
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,220
Someone is living in that courtyard.

367
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,180
I'll arrange for someone

368
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,100
to tidy up the Plum Courtyard for you.

369
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,060
No.

370
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,380
Who is it?
Who is living in my courtyard?

371
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,660
I don't care who he is.

372
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,550
Get him out of my courtyard right now.

373
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,940
Zhaocai, Jinbao.

374
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,748
Young Master.

375
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:19,780
Do you feel cold?

376
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,001
Or are you hungry?

377
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,220
Young Master, are you thirsty?

378
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,260
You should

379
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,900
work for Su Yin in the future.

380
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,420
Young Master.

381
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,708
Young master, what's wrong?

382
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,230
Are you uncomfortable?

383
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,950
Don't worry.

384
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,270
I'll go get His Highness.

385
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,390
I'll go get Dr. Que.

386
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,870
No, listen to me.

387
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,465
Don't worry.

388
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,540
Su Yin did everything to save me.

389
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,100
Even if I die of pain,

390
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,420
I won't give up.

391
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,740
I think your kung fu is amazing,

392
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,140
so you shouldn't work as my servants.

393
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,400
You'd better work for Su Yin

394
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,980
and make a name for yourselves.

395
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,612
So you can marry a good wife.

396
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,340
I don't want to get married.

397
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,675
I don't want to have a family, either.

398
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:17,075
I want to stay with you forever.

399
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,150
Young Master.

400
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,075
Young Master.

401
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,220
Jinbao and I

402
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,050
learned our kung fu from you.

403
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,140
Jinbao and I agreed

404
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,300
to follow you in life or death.

405
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,260
Young Master,
take care of yourself.

406
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,540
When you get better,
get a wife and have children.

407
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,900
Jinbao and I will guard your home.

408
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,580
We'll be together forever.

409
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,140
Right?

410
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,460
Stop crying.

411
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,180
Who is it?

412
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,540
Who is living in my courtyard?

413
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,900
Get out of there.

414
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,780
It's you.

415
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,860
What are you doing here?

416
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,820
Don't mess around.

417
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,180
Do you know who he is, Yin?

418
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,060
His entire family should have been executed.

419
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,620
I'll kill him today.

420
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,925
I'll cut him into pieces.

421
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,300
Su Yin, let go of me.

422
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,660
How can you do this to me for him?

423
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,340
Shaoyu.

424
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,500
Xiaobao is my best friend.

425
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,550
As soon as you saw him,
you drew your sword against him.

426
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,020
I had to stop you.

427
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,740
But he is a criminal.

428
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,580
He should have been escorted to Linjing
to be beheaded.

429
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,460
He was framed.

430
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,860
I will rehabilitate him.

431
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:53,527
Shaoyu,

432
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,820
I don't know what you had with Xiaobao before.

433
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,380
But you're in my mansion.

434
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,620
You should follow my rules.

435
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:03,220
Xiaobao is sick.

436
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,500
If you do anything

437
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
against him,

438
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,380
I won't leave you alone.

439
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,460
He's the Crown Prince?

440
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,660
No wonder he went after Huai'en.

441
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,860
My grandfather

442
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,420
stayed in Annan all these years.

443
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,980
Since the emperor ascended the throne,

444
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,380
he has always been afraid of my grandfather.

445
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,100
The Crown Prince has been influenced
by the Queen since childhood,

446
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,180
so he is narrow-minded

447
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,140
and vengeful.

448
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,060
So, I have to consider his status.

449
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,380
Please stay away

450
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,900
from him

451
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,820
for days.

452
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,380
Okay.

453
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I understand.

454
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,220
You don't have to worry about it.

455
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,820
I'll send someone to follow him.

456
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,260
He wouldn't dare hurt you

457
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,460
or tell anyone about you.

458
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,580
Just recuperate at ease.

459
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,500
In fact, I thought a lot

460
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,060
when I saw him today.

461
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,380
I thought about

462
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,580
how willful

463
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,620
and foolhardy I was.

464
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,660
I caused a lot of trouble for a lot of people.

465
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,580
In the future,

466
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,100
except for my parents,

467
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,740
you,

468
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,460
Zhaocai, and Jinbao,

469
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,060
I won't care

470
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,940
about anyone else or anything.

471
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,060
And

472
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,460
it's getting colder.

473
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,700
I won't go out.

474
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,500
So I won't run into him.

475
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,460
Don't worry.

476
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,860
Su Yin.

477
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Get some rest.

478
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,460
I'll deal with him.

479
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,780
Be careful.

480
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,020
Su Yin,

481
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,420
you said you had nothing to do with him.

482
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Then why do you stay with him?

483
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,340
I don't stay with him.

484
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,260
I stay in the wing.

485
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,500
I want to stay with you.

486
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,580
No.

487
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,540
That room is too small.

488
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,300
Be good. Stay in another courtyard.

489
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,780
Then, ask him to stay in the wing.

490
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,580
We will stay here.

491
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,020
Shaoyu.

492
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,780
Don't do this.

493
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,020
Don't do that.

494
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,980
You must be up to something.

495
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,980
If you don't stay with me,

496
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,460
I'll go back to the capital

497
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,260
and tell my father

498
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,900
that you are harboring a criminal.

499
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,940
Okay.

500
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,100
Go tell Prince Shen

501
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,060
and His Majesty.

502
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,260
Ask His Majesty to behead me.

503
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,940
I just want to stay with you.

504
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,420
Come with me.

505
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,420
Let's go stay in another courtyard.

506
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,340
Wherever is okay.

507
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,860
Anyway, I want to stay with you.

508
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,700
Your Highness, I found it out.

509
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,260
The Crown Prince
didn't sneak out of the palace.

510
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,300
He volunteered to go to Huaizhou

511
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,100
and help Prince Shen and Li Gongxiang
put down the rebellion.

512
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,780
He came here
from Prince Shen's Mansion the other day.

513
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,740
His intentions are not clear.

514
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,060
Inform all the secret guards in the mansion

515
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,300
to be on heightened alert.

516
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,060
Don't leak the news.

517
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,860
Yes.

518
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,375
Young Master.

519
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,675
Please sit down.

520
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,460
I thought you were a young lady.

521
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,780
You're waited on hand and foot.

522
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,060
If I were a criminal,

523
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,580
I would have killed myself.

524
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,860
I would be ashamed to eat here.

525
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,850
Shaoyu.

526
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,300
What?

527
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,460
You don't want me to talk, huh?

528
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,460
If you want to eat, eat.

529
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,540
If you don't, get out.

530
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,875
Here.

531
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,660
Your Highness.

532
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,738
My uncle stayed in Annan for many years.

533
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,620
He has great power.

534
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,820
One minute, he promised to cooperate with me.

535
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,380
The next, he took away my bait.

536
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,220
Mr. Li,

537
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,060
what do you think of it?

538
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,220
His Highness didn't care
about politics for years.

539
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,500
Su Yin has been in charge
of Prince Li's Mansion.

540
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,780
His relationship with Jin Xiaobao

541
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,340
is unusual.

542
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:38,020
It's him again.

543
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,380
What's so special about him?

544
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,860
Why are they all attracted to him?

545
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,780
It doesn't matter what is special about him.

546
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,980
It matters that we can use him.

547
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,620
By the way,

548
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,700
the second prince

549
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,660
has sent Huai'en to Annan.

550
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,420
I think he's here for Jin's possessions.

551
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,500
We can take advantage
of this unique opportunity.

552
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,660
What do you think of it?

553
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,100
Your Highness,

554
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,620
some of Jin's possessions have not been found.

555
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,980
Zongzheng Yuzhan and the imperial patrols
are looking for them.

556
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,180
I'm afraid the Jin family is targeted.

557
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,780
The Tang Sect

558
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,500
still don't admit they have it, huh?

559
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,460
Yes.

560
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,180
They insisted
that they didn't have crimson dahlia.

561
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,580
Your Highness,

562
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,475
you have to take the initiative.

563
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:39,395
Otherwise, Prince Shen and Li Gongxiang…

564
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,260
Xiaobao.

565
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,980
Xiaobao.

566
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,575
Young Master.

567
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:06,825
Come on.

568
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,380
- Young Master.
- Xiaobao.

569
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,580
Xiaobao, hand in there.

570
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,420
Come on. Give me your hand.

571
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,300
Young Master.

572
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,680
Come on, Jinbao.

573
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,550
Xiaobao.

574
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,140
You're going to get my parents back?

575
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:01,140
Zhaocai and Jinbao have already gone.

576
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,950
But…

577
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,060
Look where I am now.

578
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,780
It's okay.

579
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,040
I told them to tell your parents
you had a cold.

580
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,640
The New Year is coming.

581
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,280
If we don't get them back,

582
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,660
they will be suspicious.

583
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,260
All right, then.

584
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,900
Tell someone to take down these curtains.

585
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,100
All right.

586
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:33,413
[Zangke Temple]

587
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,660
Take care.

588
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,025
Dear.

589
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,125
Go.

590
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,575
Go.

591
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,740
How could they be gone?

592
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,380
They had already been picked up

593
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,180
by the time we got there.

594
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,660
And there was no sign of a fight.

595
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,620
Could it be the people of the Imperial Court?

596
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,180
Will they kill them?

597
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,260
No, they won't.

598
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,950
People of the Imperial Court

599
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,590
dare not kill them at Zangke Temple.

600
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,660
Then, it must be Zongzheng Huai'en.

601
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,500
What?

602
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,580
How dare he do it again?

603
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,420
What does he want?

604
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,580
I'll kill him.

605
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,580
Think about it before you say it.

606

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,380
tell everyone
not to mention it in front of Xiaobao.

611
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,460
Let's have our stories straight.

612
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,060
Tell them that Mr. and Mrs. Jin

613
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,820
lit an eternal fire for Xiaobao at the temple.

614
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,260
They need to stay there

615
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,950
for a few more days.

616
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,860
Yes.

Mom.

623
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,740
I have prepared a mansion for you in Qianzhong.

624
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,580
And you will have 30 servants

625
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,140
and ten thousand taels of gold.

626
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,020
I think that's enough for you.

627
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,620
After the New Year,

628
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,260
you get out of here.

629
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Where is Su Yin?

630
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,820
Don't you know it?

631
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,740
Your parents

632
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,775
were taken away.

633
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:05,415
Yin went to look for them.

634
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,620
What?

635
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,875
I guess

636
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,395
my uncle's people took them.

637
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:21,755
After all, you are criminals.

638
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,350
You are guilty of a capital crime.

Originally,

00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,340
I came to spend the New Year with Yin.

641
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,140
But you ruined it.

642
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,940
You're annoying.

643
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,300

00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,340
seen someone

645
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,100
as useless as you in my whole life.

646
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,180
And you are mooching off of Yin.

647
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,100
If I weren't afraid that he would be angry,

648
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,620
I would have killed you.

649
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,020
It's not true.

650
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,180
It's not true.

You'll regret it.

The Jin family is not guilty
of a capital crime.

674
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,300
The Imperial Court just wanted

675
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,980
to use them to lure out the people behind them.

676

Now that you know,

677
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,620
why did you stop the Imperial Court
from arresting them?

678
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,540
Mr. Jin saved my father.

Even if the emperor is afraid of me,

695
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,860
there must be an end to it.

I think the young master of the Jin family

704
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,740
will understand.

705

If he doesn't understand,

706
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,020
I will speak to him in person.

- Yeah.

Okay.
