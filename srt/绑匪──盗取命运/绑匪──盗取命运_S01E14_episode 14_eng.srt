1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,530
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,560
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,110
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,020

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,060
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,340
Let's go, Hyeong-nim.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,120
He was your brother-in-law?

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,460
An insect happened to bother me, so I stepped on it.

9
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,390
Out of my way.

10
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,040
That is enough. Back off now.

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,610
Are you serious, damn it? If someone is of a lower class, do they look like insects to you, too?

12
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,280
I told you to back off!

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,820
He is my older brother.

14
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,930
Right.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,430
We are mortal enemies after all, just as you said.

16
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,070
One of us will have to die

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,530
for this sickening ill-fate between us to finally end.

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,240
Step back, both of you. Promptly!

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,380
If you act this way, I have no choice but to arrest all of you.

20
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,910
Please go first.

21
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,550
Let us go.

22
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,350
- Promptly settle everything. 
 - Yes, Sir.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,470
 Episode 14

24
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,080
Ba Wu. What should we do?

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,650
I told you to behave carefully. What shameful conduct is this?

26
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,320
Father, this man was but an insect worthy of death.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,490
I am not blaming you for killing some lowly knave!

28
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,180
I am blaming your imprudence in acting without thinking of the consequences!

29
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,220
Are you unaware this is a mistake you must never make, as the eldest son who is to succeed me?

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,230
What do you intend to do now?

31
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,040
You have laid your hand on Kim Dae Seok's household.

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,370
Isn't it obvious he will come against you with poisonous resentment in his heart?

33
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,930
Have you forgotten what this rascal knows about me, about our family?

34
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,620
The secret letter! I was wrong! Please forgive me!

35
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,350
Because of that insect, I must have momentarily lost myself!

36
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,580
If you were to catch an insect,

37
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,950
you should have first verified if it was poisonous!

38
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,100
And you, you associate yourself with that man even in such a situation,

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,930
and you defy your father. Are you determined to jeopardize our family?

40
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,920
Answer me.

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,150
Will you follow your father's orders and kill him, thus protecting your family?

42
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,470
Or will you protect this grand conscience of yours to the end?

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,580
I do not even wish to look at you. Get out this instant!

44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,610
 Right.

45
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,820
 We are mortal enemies after all, just as you said.

46
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,490
 One of us will have to die

47
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,980
 for this sickening, ill-fated relationship to finally end.

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,090
Yeon Ok! Yeon Ok!

49
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,950
- Yeon Ok! Yeon Ok, calm down. 
 - Yeon Ok.

50
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,110
- Yeon Ok! 
 - Let go of me!

51
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,300
- Yeon Ok! 
 - I have to go see orabeoni Chil Seong.

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,890
Orabeoni Chil Seong! Orabeoni Chil Seong!

53
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,310
- Mother. Mother, what should I do? 
 - It is all right, it is all right.

54
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,770
What should I do, Orabeoni?

55
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,890
- Orabeoni Chil Seong... 
 - Mother.

56
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,960
Yes. Let us go inside.

57
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,720
She is so pitiful, I cannot watch.

58
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,850
I hope these scoundrels get struck by lightning.

59
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,860
That they get spattered by boiling fecal water and die.

60
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,910
It is my fault. I should have immediately dragged him out when I saw him at the fabric store.

61
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,640
You are not the one who killed your brother-in-law.

62
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,460
The left state councillor's eldest son did.

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,160
And what enabled him to stay unscathed after committing murder, is the left state councillor's disgusting power.

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,260
No. I am to blame for assigning this task to him.

65
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,130
No, you are not. If someone has to pay for this crime, it is them.

66
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,870
Do you think I do not want to make them pay?

67
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,660
If I could do it right now, I would.

68
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,720
Are you worried for me and the rest of your family?

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,690
Have you still not understood, after seeing their behavior to this day?

70
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,240
They do not see us as human beings in any case.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,120
No matter what we do, they intend to kill us.

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,820
My apologies, Father.

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,430
Since this happened by my fault, I will see the end of it.

74
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,120
How?

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,230
I will take this opportunity to kill Kim Dae Seok.

76
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,460
Are you not sober yet?

77
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,230
However, if we do not kill him, at any time he might—

78
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,440
Killing him is nothing.

79
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,190
I just have to send an assassin this moment and it will be taken care of.

80
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,160
The problem is his majesty.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,130
Do you feel shortness of breath or dizziness?

82
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,590
Rather than that, my heart feels constricted and my headache has worsened.

83
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,020
The sole remedy that stopped my headaches was the one you had given me.

84
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,120
There is little left, bring me some more.

85
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,330
Your Majesty, that medicine—

86
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,070
Say no more. Make haste and bring me more medicine!

87
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,070
What brings you to the apothecary, Excellency?

89
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,330
Is his majesty still taking that medicine to this day?

90
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,990
The quantity has already increased twofold since the last time.

91
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,150
When do you think we should see an effect?

92
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,550
It will not take long.

93
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,800
You are saying your brother-in-law was killed?

94
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,130
Do you intend to do nothing?

96
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,990
I do not.

97
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,860
I see.

98
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,920
I will be waiting. Bring me good tidings.

99
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,560
Did you find out what I requested?

100
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,440
I spread my men everywhere and collected all sorts of rumors.

101
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,990
But the left state councillor is unexpectedly clean, that man.

102
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,130
I do not know what illicit scheme he is conducting, but I cannot find anything.

103
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,030
What about the other one?

104
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,400
The son of the minister of justice is a debauchee who is crazy about women's charms.

105
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,060
He is a regular in our establishment.

106
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,640
He was recently bragging about how he abducted the woman of a commoner's house in front of her husband,

107
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,070
telling the story to the people who were with him.

108
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,930
- The husband just watched? 
 - He wrote a formal complaint to the magistrate.

109
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,260
But would anyone listen to what we common people have to say?

110
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,030
They are all on the same side, so they don't even pretend to listen to us.

111
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,800
Thank you, in any case. Where did he submit that complaint?

112
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,090
You say they submitted a formal complaint, but the Capital Affairs Bureau ignored it?

113
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,530
- Did you find the letter of complaint? 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

114
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,570
Bring it to me.

115
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,870
Is it his ability that is good?

116
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,500
Or is it that he knows the people's circumstances best because he wanders about the roads all the time?

117
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,060
I suspect it is both.

118
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,880
The chief magistrate will certainly say he has never seen this letter of complaint,

119
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,700
and push the blame onto his deputy.

120
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,970
We will have to reprimand him and dismiss the minister of justice.

121
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,030
- Your Majesty. 
 - What is it?

122
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,430
What about not dismissing the minister of justice, but conciliating with him instead?

123
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,730
Empowering the minister of justice

124
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,430
would be good to counter the left state councillor.

125
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,700
- Is that so? 
 - That won't work, Your Majesty.

126
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,330
What is the reason that you want to oust the left state councillor?

127
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:02,140
Isn't it because he interferes with your majesty's great aspirations for this country Joseon and its people?

128
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,530
The minister of justice shielded his son who trampled on powerless people.

129
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,360
Such a man will eventually end up as another left state councillor.

130
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,130
I will consider that. Everyone is dismissed.

131
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,930
Can I see you for a moment?

132
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,070
Princess Hwa In is with you, isn't she?

133
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,610
I was already told by Deputy Administrator Kim Ja Jeom that she is alive.

134
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,810
So don't try to hide it.

135
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,150
What do you mean?

136
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,110
I am asking you to join hands with me.

137
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,080
When Deputy Administrator Kim hid from the king that the princess was alive,

138
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,740
it made my position very awkward.

139
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,590
I heard you threatened Deputy Administrator Kim.

140
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,910
Wouldn't it be better to keep Deputy Administrator Kim alive, for both you and me?

141
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,280
If you can find a way, I will actively help you.

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,960
I'll think about it.

143
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,600
Let me give you some information which will help you decide.

144
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,700
There is another royal guard besides Jung Yeong that the left state councillor communicates with.

145
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,230
Do you understand what I mean?

146
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,900
Do you mean Court Lady Kim?  Does Court Lady Kim want to join hands?

147
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,920
After what she did to you, I should decline.

148
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,680
But I don't know what she might do then.

149
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,480
 Will you be able

150
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,570
  to handle all of this, Your Highness?

151
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,490
 Please die, Your Highness.

152
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,260
Please ally yourself with her.

153
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,060
But know that if the situation turns against her,

154
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,900
she will not hesitate to betray you, so never fully trust her.

155
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,120
- Are you certain this will be fine? 
 - Yes.

156
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,990
However, is there any way to rescue Kim Ja Jeom?

157
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,950
That is ... I still don't know his majesty well.

158
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,820
I still don't know what to do.

159
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,070
My father doesn't trust anyone.

160
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,960
It is typical for a monarch to always be skeptical and doubtful of everyone,

161
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,650
but this is especially true for my father.

162
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,890
Since the left state councilor, who had been his ally since he was crown prince, betrayed him,

163
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,700
except for the chief royal guard, Jung Yeong...

164
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,500
No... he won't even trust Jung Yeong completely.

165
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,920
The more that Court Lady Kim tries to rescue Kim Ja Jeom,

166
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,630
the more my father will suspect her.

167
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,090
If she tries to kill Kim Ja Jeom, he will trust Court Lady Kim.

168
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,500
You are truly ...  If I were the king,

169
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,620
the next successor to the throne would be you.

170
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,490
When I was a child who didn't know better, I had such a dream.

171
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,560
Sister-in-law.

172
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,260
Eonni.

173
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,310
Did you come here because you couldn't sleep?

174
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes. I was afraid that  If I keep tossing and turning,  Mother will wake up.

175
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,270
I can't sleep either.  Shall we go to my room and chat all night?

176
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,230
I am sorry.

177
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,200
I don't want to talk about anything.

178
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,890
Then, don't.

179
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,190
I also won't say a thing.

180
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,970
Just think you are alone in this room and relax.

181
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,110
Have you made up your mind?

182
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,300
Yes.  I will join you.

183
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,820
Good thinking.

184
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,170
But in return, I have a favor to ask.

185
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,600
Please help me so that her highness the royal noble consort and princess Hwa In can meet.

186
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,270
Do you know why there is suddenly a Sandaenoreum*?
  (Korean mask drama)

187
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,910
A messenger from Uiju came to alert us that Ming's envoy is coming.

188
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,260
I heard they are previewing  the Sandaenoreum.

189
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,310
And you're certain there are no other intentions?

190
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,960
Not that I know of.

191
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,860
If we wait, we'll soon find out.

192
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,220
Father.

193
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Do you know why the envoy from Ming is coming?

194
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,590
It is probably because of Ming general Mao Wenlong, who is attacking Donggangjin on Ga Island.

195
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,500
Why do you ask?

196
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,830
It's nothing.

197
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,190
 (General  Mao Wenlong set up a Ming military post in Donggangjin on Ga Island, Cheolsan in Byeongan Province)

198
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,060
Your Highness, may I enter for a moment?

199
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,610
Hwa In, is that you?

200
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,200
Are you truly my Hwa In?

201
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,670
Yes, Mother.

202
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,200
In my foolishness, I have been greatly unfilial.

203
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,310
Please forgive me, Mother.

204
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,930
No.  Not at all. It's all fine now that you are alive.

205
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,840
Thank you for staying alive.

206
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,600
I am so grateful.

207
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,070
Your face is so worn.

208
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,680
It is all because of me.

209
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,950
It's all right.

210
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,660
Now that I have seen you again, this mother does not care about any of that.

211
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,920
Please don't say that.

212
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,170
You need to be strong for my sake.

213
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,930
Indeed.

214
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,460
I must, if I am to see you again.

215
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,950
You promise, then?

216
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,220
You promise me, too.

217
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,140
After you survive unscathed,

218
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,690
without fail

219
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,320
you must return to see your mother.

220
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,610
Yes.

221
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,440
I promise.

222
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,390
Without fail.

223
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,210
I will return to see you.

224
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,410
If you are outside, will you enter?

225
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,950
Be seated.

226
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,260
I was told there was a complex situation.

227
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,510
In any case,

228
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,580
thank you for protecting and taking care of Hwa In.

229
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,760
I will never forget this.

230
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,020
Your words are too generous.

231
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,700
I didn't do anything. Please retract what you said.

232
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,710
In the future also, please continue to take care of the princess.

233
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,300
What should I do, when I can't trust anyone except you?

234
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,220
Until the king devises a fool-proof plan to protect her,

235
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,240
please keep Hwa In safe.

236
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,890
Yes.  Although I am lacking,

237
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,090
I will do my very best.

238
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,740
Thank you.

239
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,290
You are the only one I will trust.

240
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,210
Your Excellency! Your Excellency, please save me!

241
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,200
His Majesty has ordered the Chief Royal Secretary to have me dismissed.

242
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,500
Your Excellency!

243
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,040
Let's go to the Huijeongdang*. 
 (Hall where the king met with officials)

244
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,170
Your Majesty, the Left State Councilor and the Minister of Justice are here.

245
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,730
I do not feel well. Tell them to go.

246
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,140
Your Majesty, this is Left State Councilor Yi I Cheom.

247
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,770
Your Majesty!

248
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,880
 Go away!

249
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,360
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

250
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,460
Your Majesty!

251
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,830
- Call the royal doctor! Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

252
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,360
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

253
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,570
Just what do you people eat?

254
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,270
Are you asking what we eat and do for a living?

255
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,920
At Mount Geumgan in Gangwan Province ...

256
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,940
At Mount Geumgan ...

257
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,050
What is going on?

258
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,660
His Majesty has collapsed.

259
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,320
Prepare for the worst. Detain those people and close all the palace gates.

260
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes!

261
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,380
Kim Dae Seok!

262
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,810
Did something happen in the palace?

263
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,330
There's an emergency due to his majesty collapsing.

264
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,360
Then...

265
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,410
The royal guards have been ordered by my father to detain and interrogate the Sandaedogam players.

266
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,710
You shouldn't go this way. Follow me.

267
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,830
Let's go.

268
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,690
Hide here for now.

269
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,700
By now they will have figured out there is one person missing. You must escort her out of the palace as soon as possible.

270
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,820
The count is one less than the number of people who entered?

271
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,520
- Yes. 
- I'm Jeong Han Gu.

272
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,510
Pass.

273
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm Yi Hyeong.

274
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,620
Pass.

275
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,150
You must find the knave who snuck into the Sandaedogam troupe

276
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,690
and slipped into the palace.

277
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,760
Even if you have to call out the court ladies, search every inch of the concubines' quarters.

278
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,500
- Jang Yun Ho. 
 - Pass.
 - Yes, Your Excellency.

279
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,800
Did you not hear about the palace gates being sealed off?

280
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,330
Her ladyship Kim was on her way to a Buddhist ritual to wish his majesty a speedy recovery.

281
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,880
I will be discourteous for a moment.

282
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,630
What is going on?

283
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,440
Have you heard one of the Sandaedogam players has disappeared?

284
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,500
So what?

285
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,570
I heard it was at your request

286
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,690
that the king summoned the entertainers' company to the palace.

287
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes. What about it?

288
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,670
Is it all right for me to check?

289
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,750
Are you saying that you will try to open the palanquin that I'm riding because you don't trust me?

290
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,640
Are you hiding something?

291
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,810
Open it.

292
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,450
Are you satisfied now that you've seen it yourself?

293
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,930
I will not forget this humiliation.

294
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,060
Close it.

295
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,620
May we go?

296
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,790
Let them pass.

297
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,150
Let's go.

298
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,910
I think you can come out now.

299
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,810
You have changed so much.

300
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,640
I never could've imagined you doing things like these before, but now you handle it with ease.

301
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,920
It's because I have realized what is more important than my dignity and reputation.

302
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,100
Let's go now.

303
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,430
Yes.

304
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,700
Thank you for helping us.

305
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,840
Aren't we on the same side now?

306
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,760
Please take care, Your Highness.

307
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,180
Please take care of my father.

308
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,050
Yes.

309
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,950
Did you meet with your mother her highness the consort?

310
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,930
Why is she looking so down? Did something happen in the palace?

311
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,180
His majesty has collapsed.

312
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,470
She must have a lot in her mind, so please stay by her side.

313
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,230
I understand.

314
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,260
How is his majesty?

315
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,020
There is still no improvement.

316
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,060
I have something to tell you.

317
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,250
Change the royal physician to somebody else.

318
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,690
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

319
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,710
At this time when His Majesty is in the most danger,

320
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,930
why should we change the person who knows about his majesty's illness the best?

321
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,380
I cannot trust him. Please change the royal physician.

322
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,730
How can I change the royal physician whom his majesty appointed himself, just because I want to?

323
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,070
Isn't Your Excellency the chief advisor who supervises the royal physician?

324
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,610
It is an honorary position in which I occasionally give advice, is it not?

325
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,360
He's a royal physician whom even her highness the queen and the crown prince trust.

326
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,810
There's nothing I can do about it on my own.

327
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,500
Anyway, just know that I cannot change the royal physician.

328
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,230
I cannot leave my post for too long, so I'll be going now.

329
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
How did it go?

330
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,350
Where is the medicine his majesty has been taking?

331
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,970
I confirmed with another physician and had the court food tester check it as well,

332
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,210
but nothing much came out of it.

333
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,950
Still, we can't know everything by doing that.

334
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,670
This may be medicine to one, yet poison to another.

335
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,730
Didn't his majesty take this medicine for a long time?

336
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,400
There is something you need to do.

337
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,410
Kill the royal physician.

338
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,270
But first...why don't we decide after investigating further about this medicine—

339
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,300
What happens if something happens to his majesty during that time?

340
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,430
If something happens to his majesty, you and I will both die.

341
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,180
Don't you know what kind of person the left state councillor is?

342
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,940
If by any chance, the court physician has played a trick with this medicine

343
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,980
we absolutely cannot entrust his majesty to his hands.

344
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,890
Kill him, for now. I will take responsibility.

345
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,100
Your Highness, the crown and country are in peril!

346
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,790
The throne must not remain empty, so please accept the request to start a regency.

347
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,980
Even her majesty the queen has given her consent.

348
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,890
It is only until his majesty recovers,

349
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,790
so please accept this role for the time being!

350
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,430
The physician has died?

351
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,130
Yes.

352
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,380
It must be Jung Yeong's work. Or possibly court lady Kim?

353
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,040
I've already gotten what I wanted so it doesn't matter.

354
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,020
Um...

355
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,220
If the crown prince temporarily ascends the throne, do I also get my position back?

356
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,890
F-father.

357
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,940
Your Highness, the Ming general Mao Wenlong, who is in Ga Island,

358
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,580
has requested via envoy for additional rations and military funds.

359
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,090
- Oh dear...
 - Again?

360
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:03,190
Incidentally, the northern barbarian general Amin has also made a request via envoy.

361
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,820
He wishes to exchange our commander Kang Hong Rip, who was captured while fighting as a reinforcement in Ming,

362
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,280
for Mao Wenlong.

363
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
What do you propose we do?

364
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,800
How could we turn over general Mao Wenlong of the great kingdom into barbarian hands?

365
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,050
Obviously, we must refuse their offer.

366
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,840
As for Mao Wenlong's request ... Given the aid that Ming gave us when we suffered from foreign invasions,

367
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,190
I believe we should grant his request.

368
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,580
I disagree, Your Highness.

369
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,450
While we shouldn't hand over Mao Wenlong to the barbarians,

370
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,260
to grant his requests would be utter injustice.

371
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,650
Why do you say that?

372
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,300
Looking at our country's recent circumstances, if we foolishly listen to Mao Wenlong's demands,

373
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,860
we won't even have enough rice to distribute to the subjects in times of need next year.

374
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,650
Has the deputy officer forgotten the merciful aid we were given during the Japanese invasion in 1592?

375
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,560
Surely we should pay back our debt,

376
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,360
but if we give Mao Wenlong the rations and funds he asks for,

377
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,170
the barbarians will misinterpret this gesture to mean joining hands with the Ming, and invade us across the Yalu River.

378
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,560
That will mean war.

379
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,080
This is directly opposed to his majesty's will.

380
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,150
You mustn't oppose his will as soon as he collapsed, Your Highness!

381
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,650
If his majesty finds out about this later, you will certainly be held responsible for this!

382
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:28,520
This is a difficult matter to resolve now, so postpone the decision until Father recovers.

383
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,260
- Yes, Your Highness.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,350
I heard the positions for the minister of justice and the left police chief were still vacant.

385
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,110
The state of the country is dire, so reinstate those men to their original positions for now.

386
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,080
The minister of justice and the left police chief were reinstated?

387
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,890
As soon as his majesty falls ill, they immediately take over again.

388
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,800
For the time being, you two will need to lie low.

389
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,020
Yes, my lady.

390
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,420
Has his majesty improved any?

391
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,190
All of the physicians in the royal court are doing their best,

392
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,630
so I'm sure good news is forthcoming.

393
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,700
Don't worry too much.

394
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,080
Thank you, Father!

395
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,390
You'll have eyes watching you, so make sure to conduct yourself with greater discipline.

396
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,680
Understand?

397
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,120
Yes, do not worry.

398
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,840
What on earth is his majesty hiding in Kim Dae Seok's home?

399
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,260
I must find out.

400
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,360
Yes.

401
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,620
That means I need to take care of him first...

402
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,200
I propose promoting royal guard Kim Dae Seok to a military officer,

403
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,510
and send him to the northern borders to investigate the barbarians and Mao Wenlong,

404
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,380
and determine what exactly is happening over there, Your Highness.

405
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,090
You must not do this, Your Highness. Kim Dae Seok and Councillor Yi I Cheom

406
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,110
have a history of enmity since the ousting of Grand Prince Yeongchang.

407
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,730
There is a hidden purpose behind the left state councillor's suggestion.

408
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,570
Please send other existing military officers instead.

409
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,840
Your Highness,

410
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,020
the other officers are children of mere dignitaries, thereby lacking experience.

411
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,250
Such a scouting mission is not fitting for them.

412
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,060
However, Kim Dae Seok has spent many years hiding his identity.

413
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,860
He is skilled in disguises and has greater practical experience than anyone else.

414
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,750
I believe he is most fitting for this mission. And that is why I recommended him to you.

415
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,930
I disagree, Your Highness.

416
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,890
The councillor's words may sound flattering, but

417
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,080
his true intention is to send Kim Dae Seok to the northern border which could turn into a battlefield,

418
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,800
in an effort to remove someone who has been troubling him.

419
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,370
Your Highness, the deputy officer's words are baseless.

420
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,360
I will send my own son with Kim Dae Seok to the north.

421
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,890
Your Highness!

422
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,160
The left state councillor has made a difficult decision for the sake of this country!

423
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,320
That decision is both beautiful and admirable, so please approve what he suggests.

424
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,480
- Please approve his decision! 
 - Please approve his decision!

425
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,680
Do as he says.

426
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,390
You must not! You must not go there!

427
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,680
The left state councillor is scheming to kill you.

428
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,540
I know that too.

429
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,060
So please hear me out.

430
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,290
I know already what you will say.

431
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,680
I also know why you're trying to go, and I know why you have no choice but to leave.

432
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,620
Forgive me. I have no choice in the matter.

433
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,130
I cannot let you go. If you leave, you'll die.

434
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,130
Anyone can see that you will not return alive. How could I possibly let you go?

435
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,000
If it were only possible, I'd also like to stay. But you know this, don't you?

436
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,340
Without a good justification, it doesn't matter how much I protest.

437
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,520
Then find a way to escape.

438
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,790
If you don't have a good justification, you must make one up in order to stay.

439
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,030
You must not leave.

440
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,190
Are you going to refuse?

441
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,190
No.

442
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,960
Your aunt will have a fit if she finds out.

443
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,830
I'll tell her that you are not able to come home due to long-term shift work at the palace.

444
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,920
Yes.

445
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,060
You are to give this letter to Mao Wenlong.

446
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,760
If he kills Kim Dae Seok, and covers it up as if he went missing,

447
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,730
I promised him the rations and funds he requested.

448
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,570
This is the final chance I'm giving you. What will you do?

449
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,130
When you return...

450
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,670
you must return alone.

451
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,060
While I'm gone,

452
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,070
you must take care of yourself first and foremost.

453
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,450
Think only of yourself.

454
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,300
Don't worry about me, and come back safely.

455
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,340
I will.

456
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,710
You must...

457
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,960
come back alive.

458
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,600
No matter what.

459
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,700
I will never die and leave you alone.

460
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,320
Please trust me and wait for me.

461
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,880
What brings you here, Deputy Officer Kim?

462
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,270
Court Lady Kim has ordered me to come along to protect you.

463
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,970
This is a voucher with which you can requisition canon carriages,

464
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:51,690
and this is the badge that will allow you to cross the border. I wish you luck.

465
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,500
Yes, Your Excellency.

466
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,220
Nobody knows what can happen there, so please be careful.

467
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,770
I trust you will return as my son.

468
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,080
 Follow the man you failed to kill during the military exam and kill him.

469
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,630
You didn't touch it again.

470
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,770
Why are you doing this to yourself, really?

471
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,040
I just... don't have an appetite.

472
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,570
Later, when I'm hungry, I will eat it.

473
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,750
I understand you are doing this because you are concerned.

474
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,620
But still...

475
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,290
What is this? You finished the laundry already?

476
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,190
You should have waited a little. I said that I would help you.

477
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,420
Yeo Ju Daek?

478
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,760
Yeo Ju Daek!

479
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,710
Go and buy a chicken.

480
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,300
Chicken? The clucking kind?

481
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,390
I don't know how much oil we have.

482
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,360
Hey, w-wait...

483
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,990
I have to go buy the chicken.

484
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,240
Where should I put this?

485
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,210
Over here, over here.

486
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,980
Wait, what are you doing right now?

487
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,700
Move aside.

488
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:25,210
It's called pogye... have you heard of it?

489
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,170
Pogye?

490
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,090
Like this, with the oil ...

491
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,080
You put this in here.

492
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,200
If you stir it while it fries, it becomes a delicious pogye.

493
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,410
I don't know what you are talking about, but why are you making this all of a sudden?

494
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,160
Since she won't eat anything at all, I have to make her eat something.

495
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,850
- Who? Her highness?
 - Yes.

496
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,480
Ever since childhood, this pogye was a weak spot for her.

497
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,620
But why can't she eat anything?

498
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,970
Ah, geez... did you eat your common sense for lunch? Why else do you think?

499
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,370
It's because she's worried about her husband.

500
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,580
Hey that, that! The oil is boiling. Don't you have to put this in now?

501
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,410
You see...

502
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:18,780
If you have nothing to do, quit meddling. Just gather up some firewood.

503
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,150
I understand. Yes.

504
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,420
Make sure to take care not to burn yourself.

505
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,410
Ah, go quickly! Go quickly.

506
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,430
- Careful not to burn yourself. 
 - You aren't going? You aren't going?

507
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,180
What kind of smell is this?

508
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,580
Are you crazy?

509
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,850
Why? Did she now say that she wants to eat chicken?

510
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:05,010
Cooking it with this expensive oil?

511
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,830
No, I suddenly wanted to eat it.

512
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:10,750
I'm sorry.

513
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,100
Is it because you lived relying on each other like siblings?

514
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:19,130
Seeing you waste our livelihood as she does ... You two are like peas in a pod!

515
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,060
- I'm sorry.  
 - Is it enough that you are sorry?

516
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,560
Get out of my house immediately.

517
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,320
No, I...

518
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,900
I did wrong. I asked her because I wanted to eat it.

519
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,880
She is not at fault.

520
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,560
No! I did it because I wanted to eat it.

521
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,850
I'm sorry.

522
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,650
What is this nonsense?

523
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,600
You...! Does your mother-in-law seem that funny to you?

524
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,870
Then, take your sister and get out!

525
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,230
Go out and live by yourselves.

526
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,040
Uh... I'm ...!

527
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,710
Mother, I did wrong!

528
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,880
Please forgive me.

529
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,660
You dare to cook chicken with that expensive oil.

530
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,420
Now that I look at it, you are someone who sucks up and eats your husband's backbone.

531
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,830
If you haven't learned anything as a lowly commoner, you should at least know your own place.

532
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:09,950
Since you have become the daughter-in-law of a noble family, have you decided to live as you please?

533
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,500
If you spend so wastefully,

534
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,260
how can I entrust you with the storeroom key?

535
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,200
I have committed a grave sin.

536
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,390
Never again... I will be careful and more careful that this never happens again.

537
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,090
Please forgive me this one time.

538
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,750
I did wrong, Mother-in-law.

539
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,190
Your husband has gone a long way from here, where he doesn't even have a warm meal.

540
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,810
And he's having such a hard time.

541
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,030
You are just sitting here frying chicken.

542
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:40,880
I don't know if you are heartless or senseless.

543
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,880
I'm sorry.

544
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,440
I did this unnecessary thing.

545
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,020
I'm sorry.

546
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,520
Enough.

547
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,690
I know you meant well.

548
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,390
Isn't this a burning smell?

549
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,380
Oh right! The pogye!

550
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,830
Aigoo, what to do.... Aigoo, what should I do?

551
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,710
Ah, hot... so hot!

552
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,680
Ah, so hot! So hot!

553
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,740
What am I going to do about this?

554
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,230
What do you mean? We can just eat it.

555
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,440
That's nonsense.

556
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,250
I told you not to eat it.

557
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,980
I really wanted to have some pogye.

558
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,260
Don't try too hard.

559
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,020
If you know I was trying hard, then can't you pretend to not notice?

560
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,040
I am back from school!

561
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,500
It seems Cha Dol is here.

562
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,380
I got praised by the teacher again today.

563
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,950
Really? What do you do well today that you were praised?

564
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,220
Here.

565
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,760
The teacher asked us to define a word.

566
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,560
I answered just as you had taught me.

567
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,890
Is that so?

568
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,100
Yes. No one else in the class answered.

569
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,390
Only I did.

570
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,990
Good job.

571
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,320
Should we study this today?

572
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,760
Yes.

573
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,720
"The scholar safeguards his mind" means?

574
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,300
He who learns will always preserve his mind.

575
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,090
"Material wealth seduces the mind with folly."

576
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:28,380
One must not be overcome with desires for material things.

577
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,380
After you think about it,

578
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,490
She knows how to read?

579
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,640
You should do it.

580
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,610
You must throughly investigate the reasoning...

581
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,350
There's no way she received formal education.

582
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,860
Did she pick it up along the way?

583
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,750
One must adequately practice...

584
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,310
No... She sounds like someone who's read a lot.

585
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,970
It will surely show up in front of you.

586
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,630
Are you all right?

587
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,050
Since I'm in... a rush...!

588
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,780
My lady!

589
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:03,580
Why is she going in and out of the toilet all day long?

590
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,860
What happened?

591
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,940
I bumped into your mother-in-law who was hurriedly going to the bathroom.

592
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,390
But why is she urinating so often?

593
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,150
It almost seems like a sickness.

594
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,660
Mother-in-law, it's me.

595
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,250
What are these?

596
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:42,040
These are walnuts lightly cooked in warm water.

597
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,710
I heard that having these with warm alcohol before going to bed is good for you.

598
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,340
Good? For what?

599
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,420
Lately... It seems like you have been urinating frequently...

600
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,040
You are right.

601
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,590
You have been going to the restroom so frequently these days, Mother.

602
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,540
I'm good. You have it.

603
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:08,920
If mere walnuts could cure it... I would've gotten better a long time ago.

604
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,200
Stop being stubborn. Give it a try.

605
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,130
You should think of the effort she's put into it.

606
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,210
They are just walnuts and alcohol. They won't make you sick.

607
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,630
There's nothing to lose here.

608
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,680
This is what the royal medical office serves the king.

609
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,200
You heard, right? She says even the king has them.

610
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,430
If I were you, I would've just fallen for it and tried it.

611
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,120
If she doesn't have them, I will.

612
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,860
Please sleep well.

613
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,080
How did she know?

614
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,820
I didn't hear anything, so don't worry and eat them in peace.

615
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,330
Oh, right. Cha Dol's mother can read.

616
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,440
- Sister-in-law can? 
 - Yes.

617
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,160
She was teaching Cha Dol.

618
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,460
I knew it... She's no ordinary peasant.

619
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,770
What do you mean extraordinary? Reading a bit is not a big deal.

620
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,730
It's not just reading a bit.

621
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,020
Didn't you see her training me earlier?

622
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,620
She knows everything a lady from a noble family should know.

623
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,180
She even knows the palace's secret remedies.

624
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,460
Weren't you mocking her not that long ago, saying she was good at acting like a noblewoman?

625
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,270
You've already let her win you over.

626
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:22,360
What... as if she hasn't half-won you over too.

627
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,920
Am I wrong?

628
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,880
I guess this is alcohol after all. I'm getting drunk.

629
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,550
Let's sleep.

630
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,350
Cha Dol's aunt, you know...

631
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,720
She seems to be handling it better than we expected.

632
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,920
There's no way.

633
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,420
For the sake of her mother and her family, she's just enduring it.

634
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,140
Is that so?

635
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,550
I thought she was just a little bitter foal, but I guess she's mature.

636
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,640
She can endure it for her family's sake.

637
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,840
What's wrong? It's not turning out well?

638
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:17,680
It's been a while. I guess my skills got rusty.

639
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,160
Your skills are great as usual.

640
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,050
Wait.

641
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,190
Big "Dae"...

642
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,490
I just stitched some words in. That's all.

643
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,420
He will come home healthy and well.

644
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,120
It's late. You should go to your room.

645
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,840
Yes.

646
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,790
Don't stay up too late.

647
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:05,140
 Dae Se..

648
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,680
Are they refugees?

649
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,590
Do you mean the barbarians have already crossed the Yalu River?

650
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,760
Have the barbarians invaded?

651
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,110
Mao Wenlong's men were pillaging the place so these people were fleeing from them.

652
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,160
Mao Wenlong's men?

653
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,510
Yes, Sir.

654
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,720
But isn't Mao Wenlong stationed at Ga Island?

655
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,650
He has a detachment that is camped nearby.

656
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,640
We should try to avoid them as much as possible.

657
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,290
Yes.

658
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,360
Let's grab something to eat in this village.

659
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,370
Did everyone flee? Why is it empty?

660
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,120
It feels off.

661
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,540
I will go first and take a look.

662
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,340
Come a little closer. I will take your head off this time.

663
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,920
You can't take that! Without that,

664
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,820
we will die.

665
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,020
Are you all right?

666
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,940
Help me.

667
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,660
Mother!

668
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,010
Mother!

669
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,620
You can do this nonsense in your own country, you bloody bastards!

670
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,600
 King Seonjo, Gwanghae-gun's father. 
 Court lady Kim used to be his concubine at the time.

671
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:22,670
 Who sent this yakbap? 
 (sweet dish with glutinous rice, chestnuts, jujubes and pine nuts)

672
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,840
 It's from his highness the crown prince.

673
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,630
 He hasn't yet received official installation from Ming,

674
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,920
 so why are you calling him crown prince?

675
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,780
 Get rid of it right now!

676
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,900
 Your Majesty...

677
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,830
Royal Father...

678
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,150
Royal Father!

679
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,030
Your Majesty...

680
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,560
Are you all right now?

681
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,850
Is anyone there?

682
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:04,640
His Majesty is awake. Call in the royal physician right now!

683
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,770
His Majesty is awake.

684
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:19,720
The minister of justice and the left police chief have been reinstated... And what else?

685
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,090
Perhaps you should call in the chief royal secretary right away...

686
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,560
and cancel the reinstatements?

687
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,140
I can't do that. The crown prince's authority will plummet if I do that.

688
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,220
Is there anything else I should be informed of?

689
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,020
I got rid of the royal physician.

690
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,070
The royal physician?

691
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,300
In your medicine, we found angsokgak*.
  (the skin of opium poppy fruit)

692
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:47,140
I'm certain that he acted under the order of the royal medical office's chief advisor, Yi I Cheom.

693
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,390
I knew there was angsokgak in it.

694
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,830
It's used for my headache. Don't worry.

695
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,720
- Your Majesty. 
 - Angsokgak is a medicinal ingredient after all.

696
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,290
But the amount is way over the recommended dose.

697
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:10,580
I shall see Yi I Cheom.

698
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,660
You mustn't push yourself, Your Majesty.

699
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,150
Tell him to visit me immediately.

700
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:17,190
- Your Majesty. 
 -  Summon him.

701
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:24,020
I see that you've done a lot behind the crown prince.

702
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,930
It was so urgent that there was nothing else I could do, Your Majesty.

703
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,730
I heard that the royal physician is dead.

704
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,390
Did you want to feed me yakbap as you did to my late royal father?

705
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,330
Even though I made the suggestion,

706
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:49,550
it was you who served the late king that yakbap, Your Majesty.

707
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:52,180
Did you forget?

708
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:55,520
I was unaware that there was anything wrong with the yakbap.

709
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,960
Did you really not know that?

710
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,170
Didn't I just say I didn't know?

711
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:04,450
I don't know if the public sees it that way.

712
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,700
It seems as if you could commit treason at any moment.

713
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:20,390
There is no way, Your Majesty. Don't get me wrong.

714
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,170
But since you are persecuting me,

715
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:30,020
I'm just doing my best to stay alive.

716
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,560
What do you want?

717
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,590
Give up on Kim Dae Seok.

718
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:43,400
He is the sole survivor from Queen Inmok's bloodline. Must you kill him too?

719
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,990
I'm not sure if you have already heard it, but

720
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,890
word has arrived that he assaulted Mao Wenlong's men.

721
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,790
Mao Wenlong wants his head.

722
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:02,130
Did Mao Wenlong hurt you, Sir?

723
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,720
I must've appeared useful. He released me promptly.

724
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,780
More importantly, I've sent an urgent message to Hanyang.

725
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:12,360
Mao Wenlong is being stubborn, so I don't know how the royal court will respond.

726
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,170
If there is any silver lining in all of this...

727
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:21,490
is that Mao Wenlong is aware that YI Dae Yeop's father is close to Head Eunuch Wei.

728
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,490
That man is the only way to keep you alive. Understand?

729
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:31,200
I will try again to persuade Mao Wenlong, so please lay low here until then.

730
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,220
Do you understand?

731
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,780
Yes, Sir.

732
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,130
You fool.

733
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,130
What?

734
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,560
You are an idiot who doesn't know what's important.

735
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,080
Do you want to die?

736
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,730
You'd better give up any notion that I will help you.

737
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,600
Don't worry. I wouldn't dream of it.

738
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:13,200
Please come and eat this.

739
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,600
Please take a break and have some.

740
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,220
- Thank you for this. 
 - Thank you very much.

741
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,570
Who are you...?

742
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,690
Do you work here?

743
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,160
Yes, but...

744
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,700
W-Wait! Oh, dear.

745
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,270
What shall we do?

746
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,420
Cha Dol!

747
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,150
Cha Dol!

748
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,880
W-Well...

749
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,300
Who are you?

750
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:09,850
Me? I'm Cha Dol's mother.

751
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:14,360
But then who might you be?

752
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:22,990

753
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:29,040
 For sure... You must come home alive.

754
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:33,720
 No matter what.

755
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,650
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

756
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,630
 I'm Cha Dol's mother.

757
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:40,090
 - You are a noblewoman?
 - Yes.

758
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,170
 Does it make sense for a concubine to have a room?

759
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,380
 Only Cha Dol's father can handle this. When would he be back?

760
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,100
 I'll need to kick her out soon.

761
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,220
 When Ba Wu comes home, it will be a nightmare.

762
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,990
 They say there is another young woman at their women's quarters.

763
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,840
 Go find about her identity immediately.

764
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,960
 What will you do with Kim Dae Seok?

765
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,290
 They have ruined the country's important mission. You should punish them properly.

766
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:05,690
 Are you going to abandon him?

767
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,420
 We need to sacrifice someone to appease Mao Wenlong.

768
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,820
 I'm going to come back alive no matter what, since I have something to protect.

769
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,720
 Someone who's more important than my life.
