00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,510
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,500
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,270
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,250
 Bossam

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,910
 This drama is based on historical events but the characters are fictional

6
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:50,990

7
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,010
 Bossam - Steal the Fate 
 Episode 1

8
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,500
Stop doing that and go to bed.

9
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,940
When people get older, they go to bed earlier in the evening.

11
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,780
It seems I've gotten old.

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,300
That is nonsense.

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,430
By the way, what are you working so hard on drawing?

14
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,660
I thought of what you said during the day, so I tried drawing it.

15
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,530
If it's something I said during the day...

16
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,130
Are you talking about bossam*? 
  (abduction of a widow, the only way for her to remarry in Joseon)

17
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,620
This is how they carry her on the back, right?

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,950
There are so many topics in the world and yet—

19
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,390
This is naughty.

20
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,000
What is wrong with it?

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,370
Your blushing face is naughtier.

22
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,690
I mean there are flowers and birds.

23
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,080
There are so many things you can draw in the world.

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,630
Of all things, why are you drawing something like this?

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,340
Is the woman in the bag smiling?

26
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,710
Or is she weeping?

27
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,080
Excuse me.

28
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,640
Excuse me just for a second.

29
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,670
What a joke. I see you took a bath and you're eagerly waiting for this.

30
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,200
- W-wait. 
 - Why?

31
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,080
 Beondo!  
  (A word shouted at vagabonds doing night patrols to chase away thieves)

32
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,240
- Hide! 
 - What?

33
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,350
- Hide 
 - Beondo!

34
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,000
Beondo!

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,410
Are those people crazy?

36
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,740
Again? They went around patrolling not that long ago.

37
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,050
It seems that some house was robbed last night.

38
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,410
Beondo!

39
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,520
This won't do.  Such back luck.

40
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
What should we do?

41
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,080
we'll be wrapped in a straw mat and get flogged if we get caught now,

42
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,600
and you'll be sentenced to public shaming.

43
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
Beondo!

44
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,980
Make sure to keep your mouth shut.

45
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,190
What are you planning to do?

46
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,000
Stay here.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,670
Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim!

48
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Do you know him?

49
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,080
You don't know me? Me? Did you forget?

50
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,550
Do you have a memory full of holes?

51
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,960
Come close and look at me.

52
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,260
Don't you even recognize your father?

53
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,580
Hey!  Catch him!

54
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,980
♫  They say this is what life is like  ♫

55
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,360
♫  But it's not only today that nothing goes my way  ♫

56
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Ah, so heavy.

57
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,690
♫  Like a rolling stone that rolls here and there in the street  ♫

58
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,560
You ruffian! Capture him!

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,820
♫  Covered with wounds  ♫

60
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,580
♫  I go about my way  ♫

61
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,830
♫  I am a rolling stone  ♫

62
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,720
♫  I do not stop  ♫

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,990
Stop!

64
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,310
You knave!

65
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,960
♫  The stone rolls  ♫

66
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,040
♫  Tomorrow, I must travel  ♫

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,360
♫  a long way  ♫

68
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,830
It's done.

69
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,920
My lord!

70
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,310
My dear.

71
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,170
My lord.

72
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,430
How can you become so passionate as soon as you see each other?

73
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,150
No matter how hurried you are, you have to pay.

74
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,010
As promised, ten nyang.

75
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,350
It's twelve nyang.

76
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,360
What?

77
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,810
- Forget it then. 
 - My lord.

78
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,890
All right. Get back to the sack.

79
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,130
F-fine!

80
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,850
- Are we good? 
 - Yes.

81
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,990
Thank you. I will be going then.

82
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,330
Oh right! My younger brother who brought her with me, asked me to deliver this message.

83
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,760
If you're hard on her because this is her second marriage, we'll come again and take her.

84
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,150
So please live harmoniously.

85
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,310
You can go ahead.

86
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll be going.

87
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,820
- Go ahead. 
- Go.

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,520
I missed you, my dear.

89
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,510
My lord.

90
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,840
You scared me! Why are you so late?

91
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,650
I thought you got caught by the patrol.

92
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,690
- Where's the money? 
 - Here.

93
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,690
It's ten nyang, so you get five.

94
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,130
Forget it. Did you tell him my message?

95
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,280
Of course.

96
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,000
If we hear that he did anything weird, we'll come and take her back

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,090
so they should live harmoniously.

98
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,300
Five nyang.

99
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,990
Two Namsangol palanquin bearers!

100
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,270
Here! Here!

101
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,580
Follow me.

102
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,630
How can they leave right after we handed out the sticks?

103
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,990
Let's see.

104
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,650
There.  Shall we take a look?

105
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,030
I lost again.

106
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,830
Why do I have such bad luck today?

107
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,050
I better at least get a feel

108
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,520
for Hyang Dan's bloomers. Aigoo.

109
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,630
Hyang Dan.

111
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,270
Here, I have a pair of nines.

112
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Hold on, hold on.

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,660
Ten, another ten!

114
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,050
A pair of tens! No one can't beat this!

115
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,330
What is this?

116
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,050
Why is this here?

117
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,170
You bastard!

118
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,490
What, you older bastard?

119
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,250
You darn bastard!

120
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,530
Did you just hit me? Did you?

121
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes, I did. What are you going to do?

122
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,190
So it's on, huh?

123
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,720
You bastard!

124
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,150
Here.

125
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,990
What? Darn it.

126
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,460
Oh, that hurts.

127
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,120
What cheapskates. They didn't even give us a tip.

128
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,340
Ba Wu.

129
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,050
What?

130
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,600
Nothing.

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,290
Then forget it.

132
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not that. Remember that old unmarried woman I told you about before?

133
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,470
Are your ears blocked? I told you that I won't do it.

134
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,080
I told you it's for 20 nyang.

135
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
If you love money that much, then you do it by yourself.

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,650
Do you think I'm only saying this for myself?

137
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,640
So you want to give her to an old man close to 60 years old?

138
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,460
Hyeong-nim, if it were your daughter, would you let her go?

139
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,770
You must be kidding me.

140
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,760
If you compare things that way, when will you save money?

141
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,460
Until when are you going to live like this?

142
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,590
Just leave it.

143
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,530
I'm just going to live this way and die.

144
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,900
Don't be like that. Let's just do it once.

145
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,930
Mister Ba Wu!

146
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,680
- What? 
 - There's a fight!

147
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,420
Fight?

148
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,140
Another fight? What a day!

149
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,730
Where is it? Which ones? Let's go.

150
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,630
The Seonggyukgwan* scholars.
  (prestigious educational institution during the Joseon dynasty)

151
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,000
- What?
- The Sungkyunkwan scholars.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,210
Get lost! Go!

153
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,450
How can we stop them?

154
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,100
Mister Ba Wu!

155
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,890
Didn't you hear him? We don't deal with noblemen.

156
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,690
The uniform land tax law must be enforced!

157
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,900
Hey, hey.

158
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,960
Stop it!

159
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,190
Have you gone crazy?

160
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,020
What nonsense...

161
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,840
 Let's have a drink. Let's have another drink.

162
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,570
 Let's endlessly drink while counting the number of picked flowers.

163
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,050
 After I die, whether I am carried on an A-frame carrier covered with a straw mat and tied with a rope,

164
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,340
 or carried on an elegant bier followed by a procession of people crying,

165
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,670
 wherever I am buried, in the willow woods with the flame grass, the long-lived horsetail, the oak,

166
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,540
 under the yellow sun,  the pale moon,

167
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,580
 the light rain, the dense snow, or a whirlwind

168
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,150
 who would invite me to drink?

169
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,650
 When a monkey plays and blows a whistle on your grave,

170
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,410
 what's the point of regret?

171
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,550
Is this man ridiculing us right now?

172
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,840
What do you mean "ridicule"? You're being unreasonable.

173
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,540
From listening on the sidelines,

174
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,850
there is an argument because of the nationwide enforcement of the uniform land tax law.

175
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,510
Whether its the side for it or against it,

176
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,650
everyone here is full of loyalty to the king and the security of the country.

177
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,860
In awe of everyone's lofty resolution and spirit,

178
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,310
your humble servant hopes you understand that he risked appearing disrespectful.

179
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,240
To make up for my disrespect, I hope you will accept

180
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,710
a currently popular drink.

181
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,280
- Dul Soe. 
 - Yes.

182
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,230
Please sit.

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,470
The name of this drink is chaos-ju.  
  ("ju" for soju, the popular Korean liquor)

184
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,800
Why is it "chaos"?

185
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,000
Takju and cheongju* are mixed like yin and yang.
 (fermented rice liquors:  takju or makgeolli from unrefined rice, cheongju from refined)

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,630
After the sediment of the takju has subsided, I drink it

187
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,080
when the refined cheongju rises cleanly.

188
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,090
Now everyone, please pour yourself a drink.

189
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,290
So this is neither takju  (another word for makgeolli)  nor cheongju  (refined rice liquor) ...

190
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,900
Would you like to accept a serving?

191
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,120
Fine.

192
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,540
- It's good. 
- Please pour us one more.

193
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,340
 Pour us some more.

194
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,250
In my view, when you drink this chaos mix, you get dead-drunk.

195
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,500
Then, you start talking recklessly about this and that man. That's why it's called "chaos."

196
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,830
That sounds about right.

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,120
In spite of my lack of ability, I'll do my best to play.

198
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,920
It's delicious, isn't it?

199
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
It's amazing.

200
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,790
You look prettier now.

201
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,000
It's amazing that this isn't takju or cheongju.

202
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,890
May I pour you a drink?

203
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,390
Here.

204
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,730
Thank you for your performance. The poem to offer wine which you recited before ...

205
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,620
It was like Song Kang's poem offering wine. Do you belong to the Western faction?

206
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,920
It's not east, west, south, north or where ever.  I am apolitical.

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,530
If you aren't, why of all poets did you choose a Westerner's work?

208
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,630
Didn't you know all of the Confucian scholars who are here are the Northerners faction?

209
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,060
- I know. 
 - Then ... why?

210
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,550
How else do I make all of you pay attention to me?

211
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,000
- Why don't you accept a cup from me too? 
 - Yes, let's do that.

212
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,910
Let's exchange names. I am Yi Dae Yeop who lives in Jaedong.

213
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,370
I am Kim Dae Seok from Cheonan.

214
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,070
Kim Dae Seok. How old are you?

215
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,810
I like you so much I want to be your friend.

216
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,520
Why? Do you not like it?

217
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,720
Age doesn't matter when you are friends.

218
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,830
That's right. You are right.

219
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,230
What you said was right.

220
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,880
- It suits you well. 
 - Ah, my head hurts.

221
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,370
Anyway, I'm telling you it worked like a charm.

222
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,030
- What is? 
 - How did you learn literature?

223
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,250
Didn't I tell you? I used to live next to a village school when I was young.

224
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,840
"A dog raised next to the village school for three years can recite Chinese classics."

225
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,410
- This brain of mine works well. 
 - Don't even start.

226
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,020
If you can recite poetry after living next to the village school,

227
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,110
if you lived next to a Confucian academy, you would have passed the state exam.

228
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,430
Forget that. Just help me undo this.

229
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,830
Let go. Let me do it.

230
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,850
Now ...

231
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,100
- What again?
- I'm sorry.

232
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,620
What's the use of me sticking around you as a hyeong? 
 (lit: Elder brother. For non-family members used in the sense of "senior")

233
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,510
I couldn't find a healthy man like you a match.

234
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,490
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,850
A man who is so sorry cheated me of 2 nyang?

236
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,390
Look at him. When did I...?

237
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,360
Hey... let's talk about this later.

238
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,270
Ba Wu. There's a pretty widow with a lot of money in my neighborhood.

239
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,210
No matter how much I think about it, you're perfect for each other.

240
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,620
Cut the silly talk. I told you to just undo this!

241
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,680
Let me sleep! Sleep!

242
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,460
Sleep!

243
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,990
You've worked hard. Take a sack of rice each.

244
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,460
Ah, thank you.

245
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,590
Now that they know your faces, so please stay away for a while.

246
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,390
Especially you.

247
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,770
I understand.

248
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,270
The end of curfew bell has rung, so go ahead.

249
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,540
- What did you do that you are coming back now? 
 - Are you awake?

250
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,960
If you felt cold, wouldn't you wake up?

251
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
For a young boy, you are such a light sleeper.

252
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,520
You're penniless so you couldn't have gone to the gambling den.

253
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,440
Did you steal something? Why did you expose yourself to the night air?

254
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,250
- Don't say, did you bossam someone? 
 - You don't need to know.

255
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,780
You have to make it unrecognizable so I won't notice.

256
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,490
The smell of cosmetics pokes my nose.

257
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,920
I don't smell it.

258
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,070
What's the point of doing it for others?

259
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,890
You must bossam a mom for me.

260
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,660
A boy the size of a chestnut is saying whatever he wants.

261
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,630
Just sleep, you little rascal.

262
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,000
Whenever you have nothing else to say, you tell me to go to sleep.

263
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,170
Don't you even feel sorry for me who didn't grow up without a mother...?

264
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,750
Just lay down and sleep.

265
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,670
At this good age, I only cook and do the laundry.

266
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,240
My whole childhood is going to pass away.

267
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,120
I bought some rice.

268
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,860
I told you to buy barley instead.

269
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,120
I'd rather have rice for a week and starve.

270
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,840
I'd eat anything. It's better than starving.

271
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,280
I am the father.

272
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,230
Who said you are not?

273
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,980
"Father and son should love each other. The father should support the child."

274
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,360
I said that I'm going to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

275
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,050
Are you going to sleep? Are you going to sleep, you rascal?

276
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,540
Come here.

277
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,920
Drink a cup. Then drink another one.

278
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,490
I'll pick some flowers and count them

279
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,630
while drinking.

280
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,010
Life is meaningless.

281
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,840
Drink endlessly.

282
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,120
Let's forget everything.

283
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,840
Mister Yi!

284
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,590
Mister Yi. Open the—

285
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,280
Why did you wake up so early, Sister-in-law?

286
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,640
It's not that she woke up early. She didn't sleep.

287
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,410
Because of someone who didn't come home all night.

288
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,950
Since she was afraid that he would get caught and be  in trouble with His Excellency.

289
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,030
Still, you are the only one who thinks of me.

290
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,290
Should I serve you some honey water?

291
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,660
What did he do to deserve that?

292
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,810
Don't hate me too much, Court Lady Jo.

293
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,970
You seem happy today.

294
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,480
Does it appear that way?

295
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,410
Yes.

296
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,810
It's because today at the gisaeng house I made a friend  I like.

297
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,210
It seems that you have met a good person.

298
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,410
He's a very outrageous person.

299
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,140
Some day, I will introduce him to you too.

300
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,510
- You might like him too. 
 - Yes.

301
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,390
Since it's about time your mother and father woke up, you should quickly go inside.

302
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,940
You are having fun, aren't you?

303
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,560
I see the sister-in-law and her younger brother-in-law hit it off with each other.

304
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,330
Did you sleep well, Mother?

305
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,750
The alcohol odor is reaching all the way to here.

306
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,260
I am sorry.

307
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,560
You call yourself a Sungkyunkwan scholar and yet you frequent the gisaeng house often.

308
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,200
Good for you!

309
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,730
And you, do you already wish to fool your mother-in-law?

310
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,060
No. That's not it. I just didn't want you to be concerned.

311
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,140
What did you do right that you are talking back to me?!

312
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,920
Do you want this mother-in-law to treat you like a princess?

313
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,470
I  was wrong, Mother.

314
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,870
Even if you are the king's precious jade,

315
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,640
if you got married to the Yi family, don't forget that you must live according to the Yi family rules!

316
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Yes, Mother-in-law.

317
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,750
- Did you make the preparations to go to the Sangwon Temple? 
 - Yes, my lady.

318
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,450
- There must not be any carelessness. 
 - Yes.

319
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,970
You were just brought up preciously. There's nothing you know how to do.

320
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,600
- And last time... 
 - Did Father wake up?

321
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,510
Why are you asking about that?

322
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,640
I should give him my morning greetings.

323
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,460
How can you say your morning greetings in that state?

324
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,080
Get away from here!

325
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,660
- Why are you visiting the temple? 
 - Didn't you know it's your second hyeong's death anniversary?

326
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,560
- Ah, it's today. My second hyeong's death anniversary. 
 - Yes.

327
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,260
- Is your mother-in-law going with you? 
 - No.

328
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,160
Since guests are coming over, I'm going to go by myself.

329
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,310
- Then, I will escort you. 
 - No.

330
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,540
Since you probably haven't slept... I will go by myself.

331
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,920
Then, I  have to get things ready. Good bye.

332
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,090
Did you sleep well, Aunt?

333
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,610
Yes. Did you also sleep well?

334
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,770
Yes. But what are you doing here so early?

335
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,180
What about you?  Where are you coming from this early?

336
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,110
- That's not it ... 
 - Since it's early, the wind is cold. Let's go inside.

337
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,020
- Is it because of Dae Yeop again? 
 - Yes.

338
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,720
Fearing that his parents might find out, she waited with the door open.

339
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,380
- She got scolded because Madam caught him. 
 - Nanny.

340
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,470
Let's go inside.

341
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,910
What good does telling her do?  The Young Master's ears must be itching.

342
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,740
No, I... since his aunt was asking...

343
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,210
Just quickly prepare the tea.

344
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,340
Did you go to the gisaeng house?

345
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,060
It's been a while since I had a debate with the Confucian scholars.

346
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,980
- I'm sorry, Father. 
 - It's all right.

347
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,790
You need some time when you can freely express your feelings.

348
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,440
When I was younger, I also...

349
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,290
Keep it a secret from your mother.

350
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,540
Yes, Father.

351
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:19,090
I heard that the Sungkyunkwan also has conflicting opinions on the expansion of the uniform land tax law.

352
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,710
What is your opinion?

353
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,780
I heard there's serious burden to peasants due to the corruption of merchant-middlemen.

354
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,010
The law is beneficial to the people and should be enforced.

355
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,720
Isn't it a universal principle that

356
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,940
if something is beneficial to one, it's harmful to another?

357
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,420
Who would those be?

358
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,860
The merchant-middlemen and the landowners.

359
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,210
Even it's that the case for the merchant-middlemen

360
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,400
aren't the landowners also citizens of this land?

361
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,600
Having the landlords who own the most land pay the most taxes,

362
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,410
is just, I think.

363
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,010
Justice...

364
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,360
- Dae Yeop. 
 - Yes, Father.

365
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,910
Do you believe that there is justice in this world?

366
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,190
The foundation of the nation is the high-ranking officials.

367
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,210
The landowners are the high officials.

368
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,390
Who do you think watches the backs of the merchant-middlemen?

369
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,000
They are indeed the government officials.

370
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,580
The uniform land tax law is the enemy of all powerful people.

371
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,280
Now do you understand why this father opposed

372
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,980
the enforcement of the uniform land tax across the country?

373
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,190
Study and reflect on this deeply.

374
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,660
Yes.

375
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,190
You have to go to the Sangwon Temple today.

376
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,930
Yes. Let's go together.

377
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,420
I will escort you.

378
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,250
It's your only day out of the whole year to get fresh air by yourself.

379
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,250
Why are you taking a burden with you?

380
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,260
Aunt...

381
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,330
- On your way, don't forget to drop by the market street. 
 - The market street?

382
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,720
Didn't I tell you that I asked the store to obtain sandalwood?

383
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,190
- Yes, but... 
 - Don't worry about it.

384
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,280
I asked your mother-in-law if I can ask you to do a errand for me.

385
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,960
And I already got her permission.

386
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,660
Slowly look at everything you want to explore

387
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,430
and get plenty of outside air before coming back home.

388
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,490
- Aunt... 
 - Let's drink the tea. It's going to cool down.

389
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,430
Yes.

390
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,720
Next time, don't open the front gate.

391
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,380
- What? 
 - I'm talking about Dae Yeop.

392
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm saying that you should let him take care of his own problems.

393
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,590
It's not anything serious, but to get involved ...

394
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,690
Getting on the bad side of your mother-in-law for nothing

395
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,930
will make things harder for you.

396
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,730
Do you understand what I'm saying?

397
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,850
Yes, Aunt.

398
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,110
Your Highness.

399
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,990
Excuse me.

400
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,270
They are travelling entertainers.

401
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,240
Do you like to be out that much?

402
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,010
It's the same sky and same air.

403
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,350
How can it be so different?

404
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,180
Nanny, we should go out every night secretly.

405
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,740
Princess.

406
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm only joking.

407
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,020
Welcome, Princess.

408
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,070
Were you able to obtain the sandalwood from Ming*?
 (China)

409
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,830
This is something valuable, so I set it aside. Please come inside.

410
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,760
Princess, have you been well?

411
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,900
Yes.

412
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,300
- Have you been well, Sir Monk? 
 - Yes.

413
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,320
It seems that you are coming from somewhere.

414
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,160
I had some business in Cheonan.

415
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,410
Let's go inside.

416
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,630
You have money to lose at the gambling table.

417
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Don't you have money to pay back the money you borrowed?

418
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,720
I need money to pay you back.

419
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,660
Didn't I tell you that I will earn it and pay you back?

420
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,690
It's those ratbags. Those ratbags!

421
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,100
Who are these people?

422
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,020
Wait a minute!

423
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,210
Come here.

424
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,660
Is he dead?

425
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,490
Ah.. Darn it.

426
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,400
So they want to give this a go, right?

427
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,950
Come here! Aish!

428
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,300
It seems that he's a loan shark.

429
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,340
They're really like beasts.

430
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,690
What should I do with the bad deeds of his?

431
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,260
He's as strong as a beast. He seems to have  a lot of strength.

432
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,960
Doesn't it seem like that?

433
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,620
Merciful Buddha. Kwan Yin ...

434
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,750
Let's go in.

435
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,440
Hey!

436
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,960
Hey, let go!

437
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,170
Ba Wu! Ba Wu! Ba Wu!

438
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,420
Ba Wu's head is like a stone!

439
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,090
Good job! Good job!

440
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,610
Are you all right?

441
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,780
How outrageous.

442
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,250
What is?

443
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,970
Whatever it is, it's outrageous.

444
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,780
Next time, listen to my words from the start.

445
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,150
instead of me making you listen by shaking you up.

446
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,650
Yes.

447
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,600
Do you know what his nickname is?

448
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,100
It's scumbag. Scumbag.

449
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,110
Do you know why he's called scumbag? Like a dog looking at crap,

450
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,760
- Take care of your siblings. 
 -  once he locks on to someone, he runs and makes a scene.

451
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,850
- Listen to your older sister. 
 -  All right.

452
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,800
 You know what I'm saying, right?

453
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,320
If somebody bothers you, tell me.

454
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,630
 - The man whom he borrowed money from happened to die during the war,  
 - We will.

455
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,790
 he should at least pay back the loan to his children.

456
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,640
 Even when the children were dying from hunger, he pretended to know nothing and kept his mouth shut.

457
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,390
 - For someone who calls himself a human being,  
 - Go now.

458
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,750
 - that's betrayal!  
 - Goodbye.

459
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,410
 What is betrayal? It's being scum of the earth.

460
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,730
 - Repeat after me. Scum of the earth.
 - Scum of the earth.

461
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,520
 Right? Don't you agree, Ba Wu?

462
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,080
It's like lying down and spitting.

463
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,650
That's right. It's like lying down and spitting.

464
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,110
Who will get hit with the spit if you do that?

465
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,990
I will— Hey!

466
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,660
Did you say that to me?

467
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,930
Let's go. After using some strength, my stomach is grumbling.

468
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,920
Don't you think they'll be able to go somewhere and live off that money?

469
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,740
They have to. That's why I made all that mess.

470
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,330
Sir Eok Man, you don't have to worry about your children now.

471
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,060
Go and rest in peace.

472
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,720
Aish! So dirty, while I'm eating.

473
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,550
You already ate everything.

474
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,060
There's still scorched rice water, though!

475
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,560
Fine. Stuff yourself up.

476
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,080
They say that if you eat well, you'll look good even in the afterlife.

477
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,880
By the way, Ba Wu.

478
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,920
Do you really not want to do it?

479
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,620
What?

480
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,590
What do you mean "what"? I'm talking about the bossam.

481
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,590
I said that I'm not doing it anymore.

482
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,240
Aigoo, this rascal's eyes are going to pop out.

483
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,830
Not that old unmarried woman I talked about before but someone else. A young widow.

484
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:13,500
I've already arranged it with the widower who will be paying. It's all done.

485
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,460
I'm not doing it.

486
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,410
Let's do it just one more time. It's twenty nyang per person!

487
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,960
Forget twenty. I won't do it even for fifty nyang.

488
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,190
It's because you are thinking about your wife, right?

489
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,640
I told you not to bring  her up again in front of me.

490
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,750
A-a-all right! I misspoke. That hurts.

491
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,860
If you run your mouth again, just know that everything between us will be over.

492
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,730
All right, I got it.

493
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,070
Fine. I won't do it. For real.

494
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,610
Do you really not want to do it?

495
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,000
With twenty nyang, you'd be able to give your mother and younger sister warm padded clothes.

496
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,780
Then this winter, they will say "Ah, it's so warm".

497
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,300
- Just how much money are you going to you stuff yourself up to be acting this way?
 - Stuff up?

498
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,810
Look here. I've told you the exact price they offered.

499
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:07,030
Fine! Fine! Sit down. You know.

500
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,260
Seriously, you're living up to your scumbag name. You have such a bad temper.

501
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,160
All right. I got twenty five nyang. Is that enough?

502
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,230
Thirty nyang?

503
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,220
Fine! Thirty nyang. You rotten one.

504
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,260
What about the money?

505
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,900
He'll give the money after the deed is done. When do you want to do it?

506
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,810
- We'll see.
 - What is there to think about?

507
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,270
Strike when the iron is hot. What about tonight?

508
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,520
Not today. I have somewhere to go.

509
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,260
 What did you do right for you to talk back like that?

510
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,290
 Do you want this mother-in-law to treat you like a princess?

511
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,630
 I was wrong, Mother.

512
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,920
 Didn't you know it's your second hyeong's death anniversary?

513
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,850
 Oh, it's today. Second hyeong's death anniversary.

514
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,250
 Yes.

515
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,870
 Take my brush!

516
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,790
 You're impertinent!

517
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,810
You have improved a lot during this time.

518
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,190
You're here?

519
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,990
I see you're practicing the sword more than you're reading your books.

520
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,170
- I'm sorry, Hyeong-nim*.
 - Don't mind. 
  (his eldest brother)

521
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:52,050
The way I see it, he won't be inferior to anyone if he takes the military exam right now.

522
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,560
Is there a use in purposely hiding a natural talent like that?

523
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,020
You probably didn't get a wink of sleep while doing night duty.

524
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,830
Go in and rest.

525
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,970
Yes, Father.

526
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,790
- Follow me. I have a message for you from His Excellency Lord Nae Am.
 - Yes.

527
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,430
 Lord Nae Am* requested for you specifically. 
 (pen name of Jeong In Hong, head of the Northern faction)

528
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,760
 He's probably curious about his future grandson-in-law.

529
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,030
 Rest in peace, Yi Gong Yeop, of Gwangju. 
 Husband of Yi Su Gyeong.

530
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,380
 Rest in peace, Yi Gong Yeop, of Gwangju. 
 Husband of Yi Su Gyeong.

531
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,870
Today is the day that grandfather died?

532
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,010
Yes.

533
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,930
Why don't you hold memorial rites?

534
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,640
We don't have money for that.

535
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,400
We just roughly do it like this.

536
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,100
Father! When you die later on, I will hold memorial rites for you.

537
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,970
I'm going to make a lot of money.

538
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,640
Cha Dol!

539
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,590
Hyeon Su!

540
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,130
- Have you been well?
 - Yes, I've been well.

541
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,430
- What about you?
 - Me too.

542
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,470
If you're here, you should have come in immediately.

543
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,930
What kind of man just talks about it?

544
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,160
Cha Dol grew up a lot.

545
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,710
Yes. I grew about half a hand taller.

546
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,860
Yes.

547
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,330
Let's see...

548
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,060
I have something to say to your father.

549
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,670
Go out and play with Hyeon Su. Here.

550
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,860
Thank you, Monk.

551
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,010
- Hyeon Su, let's go outside. 
 - All right.

552
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,200
Did you see my mother and my  sister?

553
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,090
I can't say they're doing well, but there are no problems either.

554
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,360
Did you deliver them the money?

555
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,020
Why? Are you afraid I would steal from it?

556
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,790
No, that's not it.

557
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,190
First of all, you need a beating.

558
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,700
Show me your calves.

559
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,970
What?

560
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,080
What are you doing? Show me your calves.

561
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't know how taffy can taste so sweet and nice. Right?

562
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,950
Yes. I wish I could eat it every day.

563
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,180
Who is that lady who's greeted by all the monks of this temple?

564
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,640
Is she a noble lady?

565
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,420
Yes. It's Her Majesty the Princess.* 
   (says it wrong, doesn't know that it should be "Her Highness")

566
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,170
Her Magic the Princess? Is she a magic princess?

567
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,530
Not "magic" but "Her Majesty" the Princess!

568
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,280
What does Her Majesty mean?

569
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,690
I said she's a princess, a royal princess. The king's daughter.

570
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,640
The king's daughter? Wow.

571
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,340
Hey, be quiet! The monks will scold us.

572
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,380
I am dying.

573
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,980
Monk... If I have to get hit, I will get hit. But please tell me the reason why you are hitting me.

574
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,290
How old am I? Isn't a caning too much?

575
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,280
What's the good in being older?

576
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,780
You are still causing violence on the market street like a reckless fellow.

577
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,230
You saw that?

578
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,630
You think I'm the only one who saw that?

579
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,660
Even your father and grandfather who are roaming heaven probably saw that.

580
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,950
Come to your senses!

581
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:33,720
If your mother or sister heard that you've been living recklessly like this, they would be in despair.

582
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,230
Then, how should I be living?

583
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,040
Am I not like someone who doesn't exist in this world anyway?

584
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,310
You still haven't come to your senses!

585
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:51,520
As your deeds pile up, don't you know the effects will reach Cha Dol too?

586
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,660
My deeds?

587
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,360
Because of whose bad deeds am I living in this condition and state?

588
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,730
What kind of wrong have I committed in my past life that I'm living like this?

589
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,040
Please tell me!

590
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:09,600
Merciful Buddha. Kwan Yin.

591
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,790
Princess. What are you staring at?

592
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,240
I'm looking at the birds flying by.

593
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,980
Don't they appear so free?

594
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,000
How about pleading with Buddha this time?

595
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,660
To send down a fairy's celestial robe.

596
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,780
And what will happen if someone steals it?* 
  (reference to the tale of the fairy and the woodcutter)

597
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,250
What do you mean?

598
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,040
Say thank you to Buddha.

599
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,860
Have three kids and live a wonderful life.

600
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,380
We will be late like this. We should get moving.

601
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,110
Princess.

602
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,800
Since you have carried out the three-year mourning, how about taking off the white clothes now...?

603
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,110
Nanny, don't you know that I'm forever a sinner?

604
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,150
What do you mean by "sinner"? How can you say such absurd words?

605
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,620
A sinner towards my father and mother.

606
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,000
Haven't I caused them worry for the rest of their lives?

607
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,400
And to my brother-in-law also.

608
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,960
- No... I think I have spoken such useless words. 
 - Princess ...

609
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,300
Nanny, you don't need to wear a mourning hanbok. You should change your clothing.

610
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,360
That's not why I said those words.

611
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:36,170
I know. How could I not know your intentions?

612
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,990
We will be late at this rate. Let's go.

613
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,650
Excuse me! Please grab that for me!

614
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,000
♫  There are still words  ♫

615
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,660
♫  that have been left unsaid  ♫

616
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:41,990
♫  After much time has passed  ♫

617
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,100
♫  Falling apart like a flower petal  ♫

618
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:54,810
♫  Without a sound, sorrowfully   ♫

619
00:47:54,810 --> 00:48:00,960
♫  The new spring wind weeps  ♫

620
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:08,780
♫  Although the seasons pass without fail  ♫

621
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:14,190
♫  Going one step further away  ♫

622
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,310
It's that man.

623
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,110
Remember earlier today? He's the man who took off his clothes and caused a ruckus on the market street.

624
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,620
♫  The dream that I woke from  ♫

625
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,840
It's definitely the same person, but he looks totally different now.

626
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,510
He seemed like an animal before. But now... he seems pitiful.

627
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,650
I just have the feeling that I want to give him an embrace.

628
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,410
This butt is massive and his chest is firm. He is very solid.

629
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,900
Don't you desire him?

630
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,970
Do you desire him?

631
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,560
No... so what I'm saying...

632
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,620
He's perfect for a male servant. That's all I mean.

633
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,710
In that short period, you really paid close attention to him.

634
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,320
Was I the only one who saw him?

635
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,320
You noticed him too.

636
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,360
♫  My heart also flows  ♫

637
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,590
♫  And that is how it scatters  ♫

638
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,060
Father,  Father!

639
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,160
I saw Her Majesty, the princess today.

640
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,400
I told you that I really saw Her Majesty.

641
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,760
Why don't you say that you also saw the king?

642
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,100
I'm telling you the truth.

643
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,200
Hey, kid! And it's Her Highness, not Her Majesty.

644
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,910
Whether it is majesty or highness, anyway, you are jealous!

645
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,700
Brat. Who did you take after that you are such a good story-teller?

646
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,570
You. Don't play with Chun Bae anymore. Understand?

647
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,120
That old man Chun Bae?  He's your friend, not mine.

648
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,790
I really saw her...

649
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,890
The night is long, right?

650
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,990
Why are you so late?

651
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,690
- Say "Ah." 
 - Why?

652
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,300
Ah... Now.

653
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,480
- You drank again, right? 
- No!

654
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,600
I told you not to drink when we're working.

655
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,770
Don't you remember that we almost got killed because your legs got tangled while we were running away?

656
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:42,580
Fine, fine. I had one drink. Just one drink, all right?

657
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,630
You look as if you might hit me.

658
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,220
That's not it...  Hey, you know this too. I'm a man of little courage.

659
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,720
My heart was going thump, thump. What was I supposed to do then?

660
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,730
Nonsense.  You always say your entire body is full of courage.

661
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,110
Hey, that's because when I've had a drink

662
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:00,790
the world seems the size of a brass coin and I become fearless!

663
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,520
It's better to do one's job alone, rather than have it badly done.

664
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,390
And this gentleman here is supposed to be my partner? Ah, this filthy fate of mine!

665
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,430
Ah, here... We have to go together!

666
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,340
Ba Wu!

667
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,940
This way.

668
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,130
Where is it?

669
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,560
If this is the left...

670
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,230
Or this way is the left...

671
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,360
Ah, where is it?

672
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,990
This way.

673
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,690
You are sure, right?

674
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:46,290
If it's not, hyeong-nim or not,  I'm going to make you eat rice porridge for a month.

675
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:50,140
I told you I'm sure.  Furthermore, I hate eating rice porridge.

676
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,090
Beondo!

677
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,000
Beondo!

678
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,790
Beondo!

679
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,240
Beondo!

680
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,310
This is really the place, right?

681
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,980
This is really the place...

682
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,390
We will know if we go to the back.

683
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,500
You saw, right? You saw?

684
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,660
It must be that widow in the mourning clothes.

685
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,860
I told you that I'm right.

686
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,170
Quiet.

687
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,300
Just watch the patrol.

688
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,160
All right.

689
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,010
Who are you?

690
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,650
Princess  ... Who are you?

691
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,250
Who are you?

692
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,110
T..t..t...th...thief!

693
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,220
It's a thief!

694
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,890
Thief!

695
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,320
Thief!

696
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,360
Princess!  Princess!

697
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,960
Thief!

698
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,080
Princess!

699
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,130
Run, run!

700
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,330
We need to go together!

701
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,570
Didn't you tell them that it was a secret?

702
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,690
Of course, I did.

703
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,550
Is that old man crazy?

704
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,330
Doctor, doctor!

705
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,380
Here, here!

706
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,200
Madam, Madam. The doctor arrived.

707
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,200
I think it's a bad situation.  What should we do, Ba Wu?

708
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
This won't do.

709
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,870
This isn't going right.  Take her to your house for now.

710
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,750
Are you crazy?

711
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,020
Then what should we do? It seems like the dawn is coming.

712
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,590
Go to your house while I go and find out what happened.

713
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,350
You don't deserve to be called hyeong-nim.

714
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,120
Find out for sure.

715
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,820
I'll find out and then come back. Hurry, hurry, go.

716
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,320
Don't even touch it, you hear me?

717
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,920
Do you understand?

718
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,310
I know, but...

719
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,460
But...

720
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,340
I'm going outside for a while.

721
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,890
Ba Wu! Ba... Ba Wu!

722
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:30,740
Ba Wu, Ba Wu!

723
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,190
Hey, y-you.

724
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,320
You didn't touch her yet, right?

725
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,970
Did I even have time to do so?

726
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,150
Good, good. That's a relief, that's a relief. Something bad would have happened.

727
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,090
What?

728
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:46,140
Last night, the customer died.

729
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,640
Which customer?

730
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,430
The one who requested the bossam.

731
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,610
Oh, really.

732
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,180
I told you not to touch it!

733
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,690
Why are you staring at me like that?

734
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,440
It's nothing.

735
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,280
Father, you are hungry, right?

736
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,370
I will make food right away.

737
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,720
Damn.

738
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,910
Just eat.

739
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,150
But since we are the only ones eating, wouldn't that person be hungry?

740
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,760
I told you to just eat.

741
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,060
You... go outside today and play as much as you want.

742
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,280
I have a lot to do. I have to do laundry and also...

743
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,250
- Do it tomorrow. 
 - It seems like it's going to rain tomorrow.

744
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,620
You must do it tomorrow.

745
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,470
Quickly go outside and what's your friend's name? Play with Sam Dol or...

746
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,570
Or go to the mountains and cut some vegetables.

747
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,830
Where are the vegetables these days that I could cut vegetables?

748
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,490
Why are arguing with me?

749
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,090
I got it. I will go outside.

750
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,090
I just have to go outside and play as long as I can, right?

751
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,390
You are getting angered for no reason.

752
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,030
Cha Dol!

753
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,690
Where did he go?

754
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,080
Mom!

755
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,460
No...  Mother.

756
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,390
Even if you feel constrained, just wait a little more.

757
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,580
If my father comes, he will release you right away.

758
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,850
Do you feel very constrained?

759
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:52,860
If I release you, you won't run away or do anything else?

760
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,140
You are telling the truth, right?

761
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,290
You can't ever run away.

762
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:01,460
If you do that, I might get beaten up to death by my father.

763
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,600
Just one more thing.

764
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,780
Can you become my mother?

765
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,410
Huh?

766
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:27,360
Mother, I will be very devoted to you from now on.

767
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,810
Oh, right! Stupid me...

768
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,350
I will release you right away.

769
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:42,840
But ... haven't we seen each other somewhere?

770
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,140
No, we did.

771
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,170
You look very familiar.

772
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,150
Her Highness the princess...

773
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,110
Hey, son!

774
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,180
I knew you would do this.

775
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:11,590
I'm going to go crazy. My father is really helpless.

776
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,690
Father, isn't your dream too big?

777
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,470
In our situation, is a princess suitable for us?

778
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,830
Did you eat something wrong? Why are you talking nonsense?

779
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,890
You didn't know? This ahjumma is Her Highness the princess.

780
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,970
What Highness?

781
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,460
The princess at the temple...

782
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,300
See... I told you that I saw the princess before!

783
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,330
This ahjumma is the princess!

784
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:41,550
   Princess!  Princess!  Princess!

785
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,140
What... the... ?

786
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,210
 My deeds?

787
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,880
 Because of whose bad deeds am I living in this condition and state?

788
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,200
 What wrong have I committed in my past life that I'm living like this?!

789
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,570
 Please tell me!

790
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,200
♫  Just for one day  ♫

 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

792

 But if I hear that anyone is looking for me and my son,

793
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,180
 then I'll spread the rumor that you and I, every night—

01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,270
 Who are you to say such insolent things?

795
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,630
 And please tell Hwa In to come to the palace tomorrow, because her mother wants to see her.

796
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,930
 We must inform his majesty.

797
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,880
 - That won't do. 
 - Father.

798
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,820
 Our family's fate depends on this matter.

799
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,820
 Hanged?

800
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,920
 - Is this true? 
 - There is such a thing as a dead life even while one is alive.

801
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,400
 Let's go to the palace. I must see my father, the king..

802
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,610
 The person I trust even less than a woman with a pretty face is the king.

803
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,630
 How about taking her to some other man?

804
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,590
 You're basically dead. Instead of remaining faithful as a young widow,

805
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,900
 how about making a new life for yourself?

806
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:52,480
