1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,380
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,380
 Kwon Yuri

3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,210
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,090
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

5
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,840
Look here!

6
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:09,650

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,820
How dare you!

8
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,850
Who the heck are you?  How dare you impersonate a eunuch?

9
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,310
You say "impersonate?"  I am Eunuch Yi Deok Pal.

10
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,800
Who in the world are you?

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,980
Gracious.  This is the real eunuch Yi Deok Pal.

12
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,090
What?  You are Yi Deok Pal?

13
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,890
Yes! I am Yi Deok Pal! Who are you?

14
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,560
I said I am Yi Deok Pal!

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,920
Even though this rogue's identity has been exposed, he's feigning innocence to the end.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Why don't you say straight out who your are?

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,450
M-make them kneel immediately!

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,660
What are you doing? Are you just going to watch those swindlers?

19
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,850
They are shameless pretenders who even take the name of my master right in front of him.

20
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,460
 Episode 6

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,400
Hold on. Hold on.  Both sides step back.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,190
I'm sure one of them is a swindler.

23
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,940
Dolsae*.  I think we need to wrap them in straw mats, so gather up our men. 
 ("male servant")

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,550
Yes.

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,090
 (A common punishment in those times was beating someone who'd been wrapped in a straw mat.)

26
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,620
The first to move before my workers arrive is the swindler.

27
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,490
Don't move from your places.

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,830
What are you going to do?

29
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,030
What?  So sue me!

30
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,760
If they are really eunuchs employed by the government, and they came on official business,

31
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,900
they surely must have a mapae*.  
 (round tablet used by officials to obtain government horses)

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,060
Let us see your mapae.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,650
Yes. Show your mapae.

34
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,440
Ma-Mapae...

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,070
You don't have a mapae. Did you see that?

36
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,980
They don't even have a mapae.  They are clearly the swindlers.

37
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,490
What do you mean, swindler!

38
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,710
I don't have a mapae because I'm under the secret orders of the king.

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,950
I really am the officer from the royal treasury and these men belong to the king's personal guard service.

40
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,840
If you doubt me, come with me to the government office.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,790
We have a mapae.  Did you forget that?

42
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,210
Here.

43
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,460
Let me look at it too.

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,220
Don't try any funny stuff.

45
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,290
I won't believe it until I look at it with my own two eyes.

46
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,180
Give it to me.

47
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,730
I don't trust you either. Take a look!

48
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,020
Run!

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,800
My money! My money!

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,020
- What are you doing now? 
 - Thieves! Catch those knaves!

51
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,690
- My money! 
 - Move!

52
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,770
Catch them!  Run!

53
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,850
Catch them! Those scoundrels!

54
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,760
Here. Hold on to this!

55
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,320
Let's go.

56
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,610
How do I get on this?

57
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,340
Quickly get on your horse!

58
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,870
This is faster for me.

59
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,350
Stop!

60
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,320
Leave quickly!

61
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,800
Damnation!  Don't lose your nerve!  Go!

62
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,500
Run! Run!

63
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,730
Faster.

64
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,980
Faster.

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't think we are being chased any more.

66
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,510
Loosen your grip.

67
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,500
Didn't I tell you to loosen your grip?

68
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,320
Are you all right?  Did you get hurt?

69
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,890
As if you just didn't tell me to fall off the horse.

70
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,890
I wasn't telling you to fall off.

71
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,150
I meant for you to loosen your grip.

72
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,850
Didn't you tell me to hold tight?

73
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,760
You're making a presumption.

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,050
Presumption my ass!

75
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,330
How could you do something so foolhardy back there?

76
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,290
As if you insanely want to die—

77
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,430
Isn't it you and not me who insanely wanted to die?

78
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,430
Let me also ask you.

79
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,600
Earlier, why did you come back for me?

80
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,300
- Are you asking because you don't know? 
 - I told you to go. I said  "Damnation don't be scared and go!"

81
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,720
Why? When you came back to rescue me, did you think I would shed tears of appreciation?

82
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,260
I'll take care of my own business.

83
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,960
Don't be foolish when you can't even take care of yourself.

84
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,180
That's exactly what I hate the most.

85
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,760
Don't do that again. Understand?

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,100
I get it.

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,870
Next time, whether you live or die, I'll leave you alone. So don't worry.

88
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,940
I also know how big a burden I am to you.

89
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Because of me you and even Cha Dol are endangered and being hunted.

90
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,940
The more I think of it, the more ashamed I am.

91
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,040
What is the matter with you all of a sudden?

92
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,270
The reason all of this started is because of the bossam.

93
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,200
I said I have done nothing right.

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,310
As soon as my brother-in-law recovers and leaves, I'll be on my way.

95
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,990
So... since things have already turned out this way,

96
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,910
I would appreciate your being tolerant a little longer.

97
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,510
But ...

98
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,460
What does it mean when you said you'll be on your way?

99
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,250
I can't always live with you and your son, can I?

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,400
That is true.  But do you have anywhere to go?

101
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,200
Of course, you don't.

102
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Just where is your confidence coming from? You don't even have any plans.

103
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,380
I'll take care of my business.

104
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,490
I've always planned on leaving... Now is the time.

105
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,940
Good for you.

106
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,860
I was worried and afraid that you would stick around forever while blaming the bossam.

107
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Well, when you do leave, please tell me in advance that you are leaving.

108
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,420
Why do you look like that?

109
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,730
I also don't intend to hold on to you forever.

110
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,040
It's because if you leave silently, I'm afraid Cha Dol will be hurt.

111
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,570
I don't know what I should tell him.

112
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,900
That child has been so kind to me.

113
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,250
It's as you say.  We can't play pretend and live together forever.

114
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,570
For his sake, we should part ways before he gets more attached.

115
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,620
All right. Until then, I'll try to keep it a secret from him.

116
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's do that.

117
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,350
Let's get along until we part ways.

118
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,150
- Can I request one more thing? 
- Please speak.

119
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,240
Until Brother-in-law has fully recovered and departed,

120
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,660
don't confront him and I hope that you can be patient.

121
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,500
The situation is getting worse and worse.

122
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,840
I understand.

123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
I request this of you.

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,850
I said I understand.

125
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,920
What? Do you want me to pinky promise?

126
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,820
I understand. Go inside.

127
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,720
Please drink this.

128
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,530
Does he even know how precious that wild ginseng is? And how much trouble I went for it?

129
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,390
What? Did I say something wrong?

130
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,160
- How dare you! 
- So what, you rascal?

131
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,680
"You rascal"?

132
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,340
Then, should I uphold someone who held up a sword to kill me?

133
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,920
Cha Dol, what is the idiom that says "what a man says is to be as heavy as gold"?

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,410
"A man never goes back on his word".

135
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,910
You heard that clearly, right?

136
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,630
I hope that you keep the promise you made not to argue with each other while you are in this house.

137
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,080
Since the night has advanced, I will cross over.

138
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,520
You don't even have a room. Where will you be sleeping?

139
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,190
I can sleep in the shed, so don't worry about me.

140
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,880
No, Sister-in-law.

141
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,220
I will sleep in the shed with that guy. Please sleep in this room with Cha Dol.

142
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,510
With whose permission? Why would I leave my room and sleep in the shed?

143
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,340
Are you saying that you are going to let this delicate sister-in-law sleep in the shed?

144
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,570
No, we are all going to sleep here.

145
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,660
There should be a separation of sexes.

146
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,550
How can you sleep with her?

147
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,420
Until now, we've been sleeping here fine.

148
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,400
That can never happen from now on!

149
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,610
How can someone like you sleep with her in the same room...?

150
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,090
That can never happen.

151
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,330
It takes one to know one.

152
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,550
Please stop.

153
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,600
Since you are a patient whose body hasn't fully healed, you need to sleep here.

154
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,780
- I will go to the shed. 
 - No, Sister-in-law.

155
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,250
Are you in your right mind?

156
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,550
The days are getting colder. You are going to freeze to death.

157
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,470
I can't do this, I can't do that.

158
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,610
Then, what do you want me to do?

159
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,910
Father, you can't make the shed into a room?

160
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,820
How long are we going to live here that we should fix this house?

161
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,240
Once someone's oh-so-important body has recovered, we need to flee from here.

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,220
How dare you! Your arrogance is big enough to pierce the sky.

163
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,310
You're the one stuffing his face with wild ginseng and you seem to be bursting with energy now!

164
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,750
Seeing that you are yelling, it seems that you are all better.

165
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,590
Sister-in-law...!

166
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,850
Come hither, come hither!

167
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,020
What are you doing in my house?

168
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,120
I've come to inform you of the date when the princess's grave is to be moved.

169
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,570
Since this issue is regarding the king's well-being, you can't keep postponing it forever, can you?

170
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,820
I've urged the divination masters to finalize the date.

171
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,330
It's seven days from now, on the final day of the month.

172
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,130
Isn't it too rushed?

173
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,050
All the preparations will be made, so don't be concerned.

174
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,500
Even so, I have to tell my family.

175
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,540
And my household has things to prepare.

176
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,870
Try to arrange for another date.

177
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,500
- I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Your Excellency. 
 - What?

178
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,110
I already reported to the king that the date will be in seven days from today

179
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,790
That is all for now...

180
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,640
- Who is outside?! 
 - Yes, Father.

181
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,050
Do you know the man who just left?

182
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,950
Is it not the astrologer Kim Ja Jeom?

183
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,340
Appoint someone to tail him.

184
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,910
From this time onwards, find out what he's doing and where.

185
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,960
Whom he's meeting... I must know everything.

186
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,870
Yes, I will follow your command.

187
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,630
I smell something fishy. It's such a foul stench.

188
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,650
I will do it.

189
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,970
I can do it myself. Please go inside.

190
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,630
You have never performed these odd jobs.

191
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,960
Whatever it is, there is a first for everything.

192
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,200
And... it's not an odd job for me. It's something important.

193
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,830
An important job that I must learn and do in order to survive.

194
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,250
No, there won't be a need to do these odd jobs from now on.

195
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,670
I won't let you do that.

196
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,570
Go inside. You are still recovering.

197
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,790
I'm all better.

198
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,840
It's true. I'm fine.

199
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,150
Then, please go back home.

200
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,960
I made a pledge with that man, Ba Wu.

201
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,200
The moment that you are fully recovered, I will make you leave.

202
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,910
- So... 
 - I can't go alone.

203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,400
I will never depart leaving you here.

204
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,160
Even if the world turns upside down, I won't change my mind.

205
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,180
And I have no intention of going with you.

206
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,060
So, please give up.

207
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,860
Give up and... leave.

208
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,940
I can't give up either.

209
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,840
If you were me, would you be able to leave alone?

210
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,130
Yes, I would do that.

211
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,930
If you won't give me up, then I will leave first.

212
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,770
I'll go to a place where no one knows me. I will leave without anyone knowing.

213
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,160
I will disappear.

214
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,820
If you are still fine with that, then do whatever you want.

215
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,150
Do you perhaps intend on living with these people?

216
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,370
Are you going to adopt them as your new family and live depending on them...?

217
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,560
I haven't considered that even in my dreams.

218
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,230
Even now, they are enduring hardships because of me.

219
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,830
Because of me, that young Cha Dol had to witness bloodshed.

220
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,250
If I live with them, from now on...

221
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,620
I have to live feeling chased my whole life.

222
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,930
Knowing that, how can I possibly think to live with them?

223
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,630
I never thought to live with them to begin with.

224
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,420
And even now and forever, that won't be the case.

225
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,790
I already spoke with that man, Ba Wu.

226
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:52,390
When you leave, I will also go on my way.

227
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,400
Did you call for me?

228
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,020
- You heard about the moving day from my eldest, right? 
 - Yes.

229
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,990
The situation has become urgent.

230
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,830
There still isn't any news from Paju?

231
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,120
I can't get Dae Yeop off my mind.

233
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,720
Go to the Sangwon Temple and see if he is well.

234
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes.

235
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,700
What?

236
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,680
You who habitually lies.

237
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,290
What? Kim Dae Seok living in Cheonan?

238
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,870
"Dae" from the word for "Big", "Seok" from the word for "Stone". "Big Stone".

239
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,170
That's the same as "Ba Wu". Am I wrong?

240
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,540
Hey! Even though your mouth is crooked, you should talk straight.

241
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,360
Did I ask to be your friend? You asked first.

242
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,460
Why? You liked me when I was a child of nobility.

243
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,760
But you don't like me now that you found out that I'm of low birth?

244
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,530
You're a jerk who makes friends based on their status.

245
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,230
I don't know what she saw in you that she almost risked her life to feed you wild ginseng.

246
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,970
Ah, move away!

247
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,030
 Ba Wu, run away!

248
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,960
 Run away, run away!

249
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,670
Please stay alive, Hyeong-nim.

250
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,450
I will make sure to go back to rescue you.

251
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,850
What? Did she tell you to draw water as well?

252
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,410
Let's do a job together.

253
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,240
What job?

254
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,020
The kind of thievery you do well.

255
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,270
I just need you to steal one item from my home.

256
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,110
What kind of dog crap are you spouting?!

257
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,960
Are you telling me to put my head into the jaws of a tiger?

258
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,880
If you can bring me the item I want...

259
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,360
I will save the man called Chun Bae.

260
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,780
Empty words will get you beaten.

261
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,740
It's the one way to save my sister-in-law!

262
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,990
Do you mean it?

263
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,710
Believe me, I will swear upon my family's name.

264
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,250
Who cares about your family name?

265
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,250
They're the ones who claimed that a perfectly fine princess killed herself.

266
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,030
Then what can I do to make you believe me?

267
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,370
Swear it upon your sister-in-law's life.

268
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,490
Then I'll believe you.

269
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,150
What? Not confident?

270
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,030
I swear.

271
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,020
Why are you going this far?

272
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,220
Don't you know?

273
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,840
It's the path to protect her.

274
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,760
So what is it that you want?

275
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,180
The Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon. 
  (A medal that allows a minister to escape the death penalty)

276
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:20,250
 This Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon grants you a pardon from any crime, as long as it isn't treason.

277
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,880
 When the king ascended to the throne,

278
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,420
 this was an item he secretly awarded me for my efforts to crown him the king.

279
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,430
 If something happens to me, one of you two must take this medal

280
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,090
 and find his majesty, the king.

281
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,880
 Yes, Father.

282
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,170
 We will take it to heart.

283
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,590
 Wouldn't it be safer to use the medal to seek forgiveness for what happened to Sister-in-law?

284
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,460
 Even if the king forgave me, if the truth came out that your sister-in-law was fine,

285
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,250
 how will you deal with the outcry of the people?

286
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,430
 I was short-sighted.

287
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:06,220
 I'm sure I won't need it, but I'm telling you just to be safe,

288
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,760
 so don't ever forget it!

289
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,420
 We will remember, Father.

290
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,030
Such a useful item exists?

291
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,280
You must never let Sister-in-law know this.

292
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,390
She will certainly try to stop you for fear of danger.

293
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,730
Obviously! Who do you take me for?

294
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,360
What are you doing? Hurry and help me draw the water.

295
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,420
I'm going to just check to see if Mr. Chun Bae is doing well.

296
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,240
Don't worry about me. Make sure to eat well and sleep well.

297
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,680
You be careful yourself.

298
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,970
Don't make me an orphan.

299
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,800
You know, right? If you see someone strange, you run away immediately.

300
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,830
Don't worry about me!

301
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,030
I'm Ba Wu's son, Cha Dol!

302
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,420
Come here. Let me hug you!

303
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,220
You really have to be careful, Father.

304
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,710
I got it, you runt.

305
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,290
We will certainly find a way to save you.

306
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,890
Please be safe.

307
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,990
You too, Brother-in-law.

308
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,350
Let's go.

309
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,150
Please take care of him.

310
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,180
Don't worry, and come back safely.

311
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,110
I'll be back soon.

312
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,220
What brings you here?

313
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,950
I came with orders from his excellency.

314
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,180
Meanwhile, have you been well, My Lady?

315
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,600
I've been well, thanks to you.

316
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,220
How is the youngest master doing?

317
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,890
He's doing well, so tell his excellency to not worry.

318
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,490
I stopped by his residence on the way, but he wasn't there.

319
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,360
Many more people have come for the Buddhist rituals than I expected.

320
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,390
I thought it might interfere with his studies. That's why I made a request to the head monk,

321
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,260
so he is in the cave where the monks wall-gaze and meditate.

322
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,220
Where is the cave?

323
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,850
Did I not say this was a place of wall-gazing?

324
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,240
Even I haven't gone there because I didn't want to interfere with his studies.

325
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,430
Please return now.

326
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,040
I am simply following his excellency's orders.

327
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,490
Please understand, My Lady.

328
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,220
He's not in the cave. He must be elsewhere.

329
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,300
Homage to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

330
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,950
He may be in the small temple.

331
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,200
Please lead the way. Which small temple should I go—?

332
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,260
Cease this at once! Are you trying to use my brother's authority

333
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,230
to disrespect both me and the monk?

334
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,460
Forgive me.

335
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,400
I understand your wishes well now, so I will take my leave.

336
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,060
Please don't misunderstand.

337
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,490
Dae Yeop is simply frustrated from his studies,

338
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,090
so he's temporarily gone elsewhere.

339
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,130
He hasn't gone far, so I'm sure he'll be back soon.

340
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,650
You know well what kind of child he was to me.

341
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,750
Please keep this from my brother.

342
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,000
I beg this of you.

343
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,730
Didn't Dae Yeop consider you like his own uncle?

344
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,100
For my sake, please.

345
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,730
Please remove your hand.

346
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,670
I am merely following his excellency's wishes. That is all.

347
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,950
Dae Yeop...

348
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,740
Has Court Lady Jo entered the building?

349
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,150
Stop behaving so unusually and just eat your food.

350
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,530
Come here. Come this way!

351
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,750
Here.

352
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,550
Court Lady Jo! Has something happened?

353
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,750
You have bags under your eyes, and you've been losing weight every passing day!

354
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,830
Are you unwell?

355
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,380
Stop flirting and just eat.

356
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,430
It would've been better if I had died that day.

357
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,800
That night... if only I had protected Her Highness better,

358
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,880
none of this would've happened!

359
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,360
I deserve to die!

360
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,290
Your Highness... where are you now?

361
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,800
How great are your hardships?

362
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,730
Please just stay safely alive.

363
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,560
If anything happens to you, I also will die.

364
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:48,250
So please, be safe and alive.

365
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,540
If I can only get out of here, I could run straight to Ba Wu!

366
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,520
I don't know if anyone could help me...

367
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,560
Are you saying you know where her highness is?

368
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,210
Of course! Why wouldn't I?

369
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,630
How many years have I stuck with Ba Wu? If only I could 
get out—

370
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,160
And what if you decided to conveniently forget everything?

371
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,560
What if you conveniently forgot me?!

372
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,730
I guess you don't want a sip of water?

373
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,390
I understand. I understand! My, how prickly your thorns are!

374
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,770
I may even fall in love!

375
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,990
That again!

376
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Court Lady Jo, I will tell you where Ba Wu is,

377
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,910
so give me a token for my freedom.

378
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,190
What kind of token?

379
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:46,000
There is one token that only you and I will know. One that only we can trust each other with.

380
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,340
And what is that?

381
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,120
Among the kinds of sul  (alcohol)  in this world, the most delicious sul of them all.

382
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,280
Ipsul. 
 (Ipsul (lips) contains a homonym to sull (a that means "lips")

383
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,790
How could someone have such an atrocious mouth?!

384
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,390
Court Lady Jo! Court Lady Jo!

385
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,450
Let go of me, you ruffian!

386
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,140
Court Lady Jo! Let's go together.

387
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,480
I will find her highness no matter what. So let's go together!

388
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,750
- Oh look at this. You're wavering. You're wavering! 
 - No I'm not.

389
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes you did! Court Lady Jo...

390
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,820
Try believing in the orabeoni for once.

391
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,380
Look here!

392
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,260
Have you met Dae Yeop?

393
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,570
He wasn't at Sangwon Temple.

394
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,390
That little ...! I knew he was up to something.

395
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,580
Let's head for the study room immediately.

396
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,940
Father, it's Won Yeop.

397
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,600
What is it?

398
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,790
Dae Yeop wasn't at Sangwon Temple.

399
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,180
Come in.

400
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,840
Why are you here?

401
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,230
There were some books here I forgot to take with me.

402
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,830
I also used that as an excuse to get some fresh air.

403
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,170
Because I left without informing my aunt, I heard you went on a meaningless errand. I'm sorry.

404
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,380
Not at all.

405
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,720
When do you intend to return to the temple?

406
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,500
Since I'm here, I figured I'd stay a few days.

407
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,570
Is that so?

408
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,800
Then let's catch up tomorrow. Go ahead and retire for the night.

409
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,540
Yes, Father.

410
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,290
Something is suspicious.

411
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,760
What do you think?

412
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,110
 You know what kind of child Dae Yeop is to me.

413
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:16,050
 Keep this a secret from my brother. I beg you.

414
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,900
It seems we missed each other.

415
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,140
What kind of signal does he plan to give me?

416
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,540
It's a fire! It's a fire!

417
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,230
It's a fire!

418
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,830
There's a fire in the shed. Hurry and see to it!

419
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,160
It's a fire! It's a fire!

420
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,460
- It's a fire! 
 - What shall we do?!

421
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,210
- Oh dear! 
 - It's a fire!

422
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,190
That crazy fool. Setting fire to his own house as a signal?

423
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,620
It's a fire!

424
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,090
Don't just stand there! Put out the fire!

425
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,770
Make sure the fire doesn't spread!

426
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,340
Don't stop drawing water!

427
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,320
Hurry! Hurry and extinguish this fire!

428
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,210
Hurry!

429
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,170
Go and bring more people! Now!

430
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,480
Hurry!

431
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,030
Move quickly! Now!

432
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,600
This won't do. Follow me.

433
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,220
Yes!

434
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,000
 If you look to the left of the table, you'll find a stationery case.

435
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,610
 The box inside the case should contain the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon.

436
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,550
Father, we must escape!

437
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,500
I heard you.

438
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,630
The fire may spread, so get these to safety.

439
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,950
Yes, understood!

440
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,420
 What do I do?

441
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,670
 Do I wait until they're asleep?

442
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,860
 Dae Yeop, you son of a dog! What are you doing?!

443
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,230
- Oh, Young Master! 
 - Go see to the fire.

444
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,060
What are you doing? Don't you see the fire? Go see to it!

445
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,020
I am under strict orders from his excellency to not leave my post no matter what.

446
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,080
I will guard your post, so don't worry. Go and take care of the fire!

447
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,870
I'm sorry, but I cannot do that.

448
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,450
You're quite the stubborn one.

449
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,470
Wait, what's that?

450
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,880
What's going on? Is something happening outside?

451
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,640
- Follow me. 
 - Wait, wait!

452
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,920
If I follow you, they wouldn't cut me... like this, would they?

453
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,430
Shut up and follow me.

454
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,960
Hey, you useless nobleman! Take me with you!

455
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,610
Young Master! Oh, Young Master.

456
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,510
We're going with Court Lady Jo! Oh, joy!

457
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,290
The man named Ba Wu hasn't arrived yet.

458
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,190
What do you mean Ba Wu?

459
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,800
Why the heck would Ba Wu be here?

460
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,700
Go ahead to the bier hut* and wait for me there. I'll bring Ba Wu with me.
  (Storage place for funeral utensils and biers) .

461
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,110
Wait.

462
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,670
Father!

463
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,660
What's the problem?

464
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,600
Mother asked to see you in her room.

465
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,850
What did she want?

466
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,950
While I do not know the reason, it seemed urgent.

467
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,740
I understand.

468
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,600
Please go.

469
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,610
Hey!

470
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,280
You hid like a good thief should.

471
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,350
You said you'd take care of your father. Because of you, I—!

472
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,390
Each second is precious. Hurry.

473
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,240
What about Hyeong-nim Chun Bae ?

474
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,640
That rude little ...!

475
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,440
This way!

476
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,760
Father!

477
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,600
Have you not seen your mother?

478
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,180
Is she not in her room?

479
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,410
I'm asking you because she isn't.

480
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,190
I will find her.

481
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,940
Your Excellency!

482
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,350
What's happening over there?

483
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,040
Thankfully the fire has been contained.

484
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,420
Good work. Oh, and haven't you seen Dae Yeop?

485
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,180
 Yi I Cheom, you bastard!

486
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,830
I will look for him.

487
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,120
 This is the ringleader of the rebel faction, Kim Je Nam. Behead him!

488
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,390
What are you doing?!

489
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,850
Are you out of your mind?

490
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,810
If we're caught now, it's not just you who will die.

491
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,600
That ruffian Chun Bae will certainly die, but even your son Cha Dol!

492
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,000
Everyone you know will not be safe.

493
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,970
 You were my enemy too!

494
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,330
 You were that bastard's son.

495
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,060
I don't know what the reason is...

496
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,810
Once we're caught it's all over.

497
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,660
Is this so important that you must do this?

498
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,150
Would you trade this for

499
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,040
all of the lives that you cherish?

500
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,480
I assume you brought the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon?

501
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,180
Answer me! Do you have the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon?

502
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,860
Don't worry.

503
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:17,310
As soon as I verify Hyeong-nim Chun Bae 's safety, I'll turn it over to you.

504
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,150
Don't look at me with those eyes again.

505
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,490
You may die by my hand.

506
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,970
What in the world happened in my home?

507
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,870
By chance did Father...?

508
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:43,350
If I open my lips, either you or I must die here.

509
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,370
Do you still want to hear?

510
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't even have the slightest desire to exchange the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon for Hyeong Chun Bae's life,

511
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,520
so go ahead.

512
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,620
There must be a reason why you're doing this,

513
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,900
I will not ask you further.

514
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,280
However, if Sister-in-law is hurt as a result,

515
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,250
I will not leave you be.

516
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,280
Bear that in mind.

517

- What is the meaning of this? 
 - You wanted it.

537
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,390
If you don't, I'll take it back.

538
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,040

♫  Spin round and round in the same place  ♫

540
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,960
I can't think straight—! Can't you stay still?

541
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,750
Oh! Ba Wu!

542
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,630
Hyeong-nim!

543
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,190
No part of you is harmed?

544
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,840
Did you forget? I'm used to beatings!

545
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,230
I told you that I used to make money by getting flogged on behalf of others, didn't I?

546
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,710
As if that's something to be proud of.

547
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,030
Yes. Oh right, Cha Dol is well, isn't he?

548
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,950
Thanks to you, Hyeong-nim, he is.

549
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,490
Good!

550
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,590
I can't continue to watch you two like this.

551
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,510
Let's hurry and leave. We can't waste a moment.

552
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,220
The little rascal has no sense of emotion.

553
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,950
I-I mean... The young master is so full of empathy, right?

554
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,420
Who's this?

555
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,960
Oh! This is Madam Court Lady. Madam Court Lady.

556
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,190
- She's on our side, so she has to come with us! 
 - How dare!

557
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,260
Was that the first time you saw a handsome man?

558
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,890
Your gaze will bore holes through my face.

559
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,000
I told you she's on our side!

560
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,500
You can be on her side all you want.

561
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,040
What a rotten mouth! Only his face looks so smooth.

562
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,390
He's an utter ruffian!

563
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,000
Court Lady Jo. You sure know how to see a person!

564
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,960
So you should only look at me!

565
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,820
But what does the young master plan on doing?

566
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,990
Does he have no thoughts of returning home?

567
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,390
It's fine.

568
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,390
As long as we have the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon, you're sure you can save the princess?

569
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:02,090
If things go awry, I will die before my sister-in-law does.

570
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:06,520
You just worry about protecting her at all costs until I come back for her.

571
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,360
Hyeong-nim! Let's go.

572
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,330
I'll leave her in your hands.

573
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,490
Don't worry, and please come back safely.

574
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:25,400
I will watch closely over her.

575
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,730
I'll trust you, Court Lady Jo.

576
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,650
- Let's go too. 
 - Hey, wait, wait!

577
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,360
Are we not going with the young master?

578
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,780
Oh, but... what?

579
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,820
 Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon 免死鐵券
 (Escape the Death Penalty for a Crime)

580
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,600
 Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon  免死鐵券
 (Escape the Death Penalty for a Crime)

581
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,660
This is certainly the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon that I granted your family.

582
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,720
But... why have you brought me this?

583
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:22,090
I'm asking you what sin you want cleared with this medal?

584
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,360
Princess Hwa In is alive, Your Majesty.

585
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,630
My father conducted a funeral for a healthy, living princess.

586
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:37,220
Please forgive him for committing fraud, Your Majesty!

587
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,730
I cannot believe what you're saying.

588
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,530
I demand details immediately!

589
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,730
The reason my father lied to you...

590
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,930
Her highness was taken by bossam.

591
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,590
Please, forgive this wretched son's father, Your Majesty!

592
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,420
Since you brought this Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon, I certainly should forgive him.

593
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,360
But what about Hwa In? What do you plan on doing with her?

594
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,530
I will take her to a place where nobody knows

595
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,960
I will hide for the rest of our lives, Your Majesty.

596
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,560
- Did the Left State Councillor order you to do this? 
 - No, Your Majesty.

597
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,240
Then...

598
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:38,760
In order to save her highness's life, I set out without my father's knowledge.

599
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,770
The father intends to fool me to the end.

600
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,930
And the son intervened to protect his sister-in-law and his family's name?

601
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,700
Please forgive this wretched son's father, Your Majesty!

602
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,660
I shall call for you later, so leave for now.

603
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,870
- Your Majesty, my father—! 
 - I told you to leave!

604
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,510
- Is Jung Yeong outside? 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

605
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,470
Hide this boy where no one will find him for the time being.

606
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

607
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,720
Your Majesty, it's Court Lady Kim.

608
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,460
Have everyone step back.

609
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

610
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,040
Did you send for me, Your Majesty?

611
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,240
I saw Hwa In here. Do you remember that day?

612
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,120
I'm certain she was here.

613
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,620
You deceived me and had a meeting with the Left State Councillor, Yi I Cheom, and made a deal with him.

614
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,570
Am I wrong?

615
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:41,960
Y-your Majesty... th-that is ...

616
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,100
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

617
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,610
Report to me every little detail.

618
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,000
I will decide after hearing what you have to say.

619
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:05,550
 Please die, Your Highness.

620
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:15,960
 Only this way will preserve both his majesty and the Jongmyo Shrine of past kings.

621
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,990
 I'm telling you this out of selfless concern to save the king.

622
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,920
 You must trust me.

623
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,780
Everything I did was for Your Majesty's sake.

624
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,220
Please just believe this, Your Majesty!

625
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,900
I know. That is why I kept you alive.

626
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:52,910
However, deceive me again, and even you will not escape my wrath.

627
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,570
Do you understand?

628
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,410
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

629
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,650
Gae Si.

630
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,090
Yes, Your Majesty?

631
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,560
There is something you must do for me.

632
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,510
So you are saying that Princess Hwa In didn't kill herself.

633
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,080
She and the Left State Councillor's youngest son fell for each other and fled by night.

634
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,440
The Left State Councillor was afraid this news would be revealed,

635
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,220
fabricated her highness's suicide, and deceived the king. Is that what happened?

636
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,760
Yes, that is correct, Brother-in-law.

637
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,710
Who did you hear this from?

638
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,660
No... who told you to relay this to me?

639
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,800
Was it Court Lady Kim?

640
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,130
Or was it His Majesty himself?

641
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,800
N-no it wasn't, I...

642
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,010
I merely heard the rumors floating around the palace.

643
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,420
I will take my leave now.

644
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,330
Sister-in-law!

645
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,000
Please let Court Lady Kim know that the arrow has been fired.

646
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,960
What does that mean?

647
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,880
She will understand if she hears it.

648
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,980
I won't see you out.

649
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,920
I thought there was a foul stench coming from that house.

650
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,010
The king's target in the end was...

651
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:56,070
the leader of the Great North, Yi I Cheom, all along!

652
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,520
I will have to put my life on the line.

653
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,150
Listen, is anyone waiting out there?

654
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,790
Yes, my lord!

655
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:08,790
Bring me the slave hunters. Right now.

656
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,350
Where is Hwa In now?

657
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,860
She is in Paju.

658
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,030
Bring her before me.

659
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,550
Then I will do as you ask.

660
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,990
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

661
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:43,290
You must bring her alive, understand?

662
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,520
I will make sure to do that, Your Majesty.

663
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:56,860
And... nobody must know anything about this besides us two.

664
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,960
If your father catches wind of this, our pact will be considered void.

665
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Remember this.

666
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,950
I will keep it to heart.

668
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,960
Do you... really intend to forgive the Left State Councillor?

669
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,080
Then, as you say, I have nothing to gain from it.

670
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,700
Then...?

671
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,920
If he brings Hwa In, I will forgive him.

672
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,260
But the boy will not be able to bring her.

673
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:44,650
Isn't there an arrow fired in my place?

674
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,940
Hey, Ba Wu!

675
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,640
It's that house over there right?

676
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,110
It looks just like you!

677
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,540
Let's hurry to them.

678
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,530
Your Highness! Your Highness, the princess!

679
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,430
Cha Dol!

680
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,610
- Ajussi Chun Bae! 
 - I'm here!

681
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,480
- My Cha Dol! 
 - Your Highn—

682
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,280
Were you well?

683
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,060
Court Lady Jo!

684
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,500
Your... Your Highness!

685
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,280
Your Highness! Your Highness!

686
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,970
Get up this instant!

687
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:01,780
Your Highness!

688
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,690
Your Highness! You went through such hardships!

689
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,770
This is all my fault.

690
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,570
Please kill me!

691
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,050
Please get up, right now.

692
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,980
Your Highness, have you been well?

693
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,020
Please calm down.

694
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,330
Father!

695
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,260
Do you know how much I waited for you?

696
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:48,110
Father... are you sick?

697
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,290
We're going to leave this place, so start packing our things with Mr. Chun Bae.

698
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,620
What, already? You haven't been here that long. Where do you plan to go?

699
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,030
I'll explain along the way.

700
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,120
For now, go inside and pack some clothes for Cha Dol and me.

701
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,750
You need to make some sense first, you rascal!

702
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,830
I'll tell you later!

703
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,310
Has something happened in Hanyang?

704
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,860
It doesn't matter what happened there.

705
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,690
For that whole trip, you didn't say a single word.

706
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,440
And now you want me to pack your things.

707
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,390
I'm sorry.

708
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,820
But please let's just do what I say, Hyeong-nim. I beg you.

709
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,580
I mean... I'll-I'll do it, it's just...

710
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,460
Let's talk for a moment.

711
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,340
You wretch! Is her highness your friend? How dare you speak—!

712
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,960
Nanny...

713
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,080
Come see me for a second.

714
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,850
That little ...!

715
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:48,410
- Your Highness... 
 - Don't worry too much.

716
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,820
Your— Your—

717
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,480
Uh... Hey, Ba Wu!

718
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,520
Go easy on her! Go easy!

719
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,620
We're leaving this place immediately.

720
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,060
When the young master returns, you can escape with him.

721
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,070
Or you can live here with him.

722
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,350
You can decide.

723
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,850
Did you not understand?

724
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,170
We're finally parting ways.

725
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,420
Why are you suddenly doing this?

726
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:49,680
I no longer want to live anxiously because of you.

727
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,480
Even for Cha Dol's sake, I no longer... can live with you.

728
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,490
Is that truly the only reason?

729
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,100
Didn't you also say you'd leave us when the time was right?

730
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,970
The young master will now take care of you

731
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,850
so don't get your life entangled with me anymore

732
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,810
and let's just go our separate ways without hesitation.

733
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:11,160
Just what exactly happened back there?

734
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,140
Don't just bottle it up inside and tell me—

735
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,770
Whatever happened back there...

736
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,060
what does that have to do with you?

737
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,820
Even if we go our separate ways, I must be the one to leave.

738
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,460
That house is the house that you purchased for yourself.

739
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,220
Does it make sense that you and Cha Dol leave the house?

740
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,600
Don't be stubborn. Tell me honestly.

741
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,650
Why exactly are you doing this?

742
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,540
I don't want to entangle myself with you.

743
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,970
But if I told you to leave, you'd make excuses left and right!

744
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:49,260
I think you'd try to live with us no matter what, so that's why... we're leaving first.

745
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,160
Do you still not understand?

746
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,580
Should I be even more blunt?

747
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,760
I'm now sick of seeing you bumbling about—

748
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,100
I got it.

749
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,390
I understand, so stop.

750
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:02,880
♫  After a long time has passed  ♫

751
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,080
Thanks for everything so far.

752
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,310
I will repay my debt to you—

753
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:11,790
Forget all of that. Let's never ...

754
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,220
see each other again.

755
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:20,820
♫ The boat sails as if dancing ♫

756
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:29,070
♫ Suddenly my heart also flows ♫

757
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:34,370
♫ And that is how it scatters ♫

758
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:42,320
♫ The faint memory that blew away with the wind ♫

759
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,560
♫ The dream that I woke from ♫

760
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,900
 You're trading in every life you consider precious.

761
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,670
 Is this more important than them?

762
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,340
  ♫ The petal of new spring brought by the clouds ♫

763
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,120
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

764
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,930
 I should at least see her highness's face.

765
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,180
 We're never going to see each other again. What's the point of seeing her face?

766
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,320
 There's no guarantee that the princess will be safe.

767
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,090
 Why are they here to chase the princess again?

768
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,820
 I don't know who, but to them, it's proof that I am needed alive.

769
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,650
 Without your orders, no one will even see the shadow of the princess.

770
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,090
 Just in case, I called for someone who can keep Yi I Cheom under control.

771
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:22,790
 Past and present, the only woman I've ever loved is her.

772
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,490
 Are you going to take revenge?

773
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:27,650
 Because it's his daughter-in-law, you are going to do nothing even if she gets captured?

774
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:31,000
 I pledged that as long as I'm alive, I will repay this grudge.

775
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,920
 So why am I so distressed?

776
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,680
