1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,520
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,580
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,220
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,970

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,020
 Bossam

6
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,840
Have you been well?

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,820
Your Excellency.

8
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,550
Did you just call me, "Your Excellency"?

9
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,520
If not "Your Excellency", what else should I call you?

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,330
Your daughter-in-law, princess Hwa In, is already dead.

11
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,720
Isn't that why you held a funeral for her?

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,950
Despite that, do you still expect me to treat you like my father-in-law?

13
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,820
You've changed a lot.

14
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,740
I haven't changed. This is who I truly am.

15
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,430
You simply haven't seen this side of me yet.

16
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,080
It would've been nice if I had noticed it sooner.

17
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,910
It's unfortunate that I'll not be seeing you anymore.

18
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,730
Stop!

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,820
What are you doing?

20
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,700
What are you waiting for?

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,550
Who are you peons?

22
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,880
They usually share their food with us at this time of day. So that's why we're here.

23
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,590
This is the grain my royal father rewarded for the work he's done in the northern frontier.

25
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,020
It's grain we received thanks to you.

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,290
It seems that you have unintentionally played a part in providing for the needs of the people.

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,290
Make these people go away and take this woman immediately!

28
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,210
How dare you! Do you realize who you are unsheathing your swords against?

29
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,850
They are innocent villagers. I demand you step aside immediately!

30
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,640
Kill anyone who resists!

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,050
You will have to kill us all, then!

32
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,160
Your Excellency!

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,850
You can kill me here and now... or you can step aside this instant.

34
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,100
- Why would he kill her? 
 - But she's so nice.

35
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,520
Who is that man anyway?

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,890
And never look for me again.

37
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,830
If you do this ...

38
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,790
I will forget the sins you committed...

39
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,820
in the past.

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
Let's go back.

41
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,880
Are you all right?

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,020
Don't do this again.

43
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,490
Were you all very frightened? Let's hurry in.

44
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,690
Please hurry in.

45
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,640
Ah... here you go.

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,290
How could you give me so much? Thank you, sir!

47
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,200
Next one, please.

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Cha Dol's mother.

49
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,310
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, Mother-in-law.

50
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,260
- Forgive me for worrying you. 
 - Not at all.

51
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,850
If not for you, that man Yi I Cheom...

52
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,790
would still have targeted our household, so don't keep funny thoughts in your mind.

53
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,600
There's nothing to thank me for.

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,280
You asked me to think of you as my daughter-in-law. Were those empty words?

56
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,310
No, Mother-in-law.

57
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,300
Dealing with such an inhumane man must have been tiring

58
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,700
so I'll take care of things here and you go have some rest.

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,280
It's all right. I'll take care of this, so please go inside and rest.

60
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
Listen to your mother-in-law!

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,090
- Mother-in-law... 
 - Dear me!

62
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,280
How could your relationship be this good?

63
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,940
I will take care of it all, so both of you can go in.

64
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,760
Hurry. Hurry!

65
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,910
They say the lucky ones can lazily sleep their way into a woman's arms.

66
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,060
I'm so envious.

67
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,490
You're envious? For what?

68
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,130
If you're so envious, you can make up with Yeo Ju Daek.

69
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,900
Y-yeo Ju Daek.

70
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,110
There's no doubt that his majesty is also aware of everything.

71
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,440
Of course he knows.

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,060
He has kept her closely hidden, just waiting for the opportunity

73
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,420
to bring me down by using her.

74
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,490
We must come up with a plan, Father. At this rate, we will all die.

75
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,080
Your Excellency. You've been summoned to the palace.

76
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,220
It seems his majesty has found out already. You mustn't go back to the palace.

77
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,190
You don't know what he will do.

78
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,270
You may never return from there!

79
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,400
Can you kill the princess by tonight?

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
I will go personally.

81
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,320
Let the king know that I cannot visit him due to illness.

82
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,180
Yes.

83
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,730
We must kill the princess at all costs.

84
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,900
If she disappears and dies,

85
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,540
then even the king won't be able to reproach me.

86
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,680
Yes, Your Excellency.

87
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,090
What happened to the princess?

88
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,920
There were a lot of eyes, so his excellency had no choice but to return empty-handed.

89
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,020
Give me as many details as you can. Right now!

90
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,960
What do you plan to do, exactly?

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,590
Your safety cannot be guaranteed if you lose his excellency's trust.

92
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,830
I have always held her in my heart since childhood.

93
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,830
How could I turn my back on her?

94
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,820
Don't you also have someone like that?

95
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

96
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,040
But please... keep a low profile.

97
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,250
What about Dae Yeop? Is he all right?

98
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,630
Yes. Please don't worry too much.

99
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,150
- There's nobody here. 
 - Search every corner.

100
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,750
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

101
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,400
Go!

102
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,660
Strike them down!

103
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,260
No! Over there!

104
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,490
You're...?

105
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,590
Halt!

106
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,830
Are you not hurt anywhere?

107
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,370
No, Father.

108
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,240
Thanks to Court Lady Kim's warning, we were able to escape danger.

109
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,870
What was your reason for revealing yourself, instead of hiding or escaping?

110
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,200
Since he fount out that I live there,

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,580
I realized there was no point in hiding or escaping.

112
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,700
Whose clever idea was it?

113
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,360
Did you gather the people to block Yi I Cheom?

114
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,540
No, Father.

115
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,590
We had been sharing food with people.

116
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,200
Who thought of giving them food?

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,220
It was Princess Hwa In's idea.

118
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,940
She wanted to help the people who were struggling to provide for themselves.

119
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,560
How commendable of you. How did you even think to do such things?

120
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,590
I was ignorant when I was living in the palace.

121
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,920
But when I lived among the people and saw their struggles, this was my natural response.

122
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,950
As for you, what exactly were you doing standing idly by?

123
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,790
I told you to protect her with your life. How could you just stand idly by while she faced that man?

124
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,510
Father...

125
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,920
The Yi I Cheom that I know would even go so far as to kill the king if he set his mind to it.

126
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,490
Do you think such a man wouldn't kill the princess?

127
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,650
He only stayed his hand because he had other plans.

128
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,050
Father, this was all according to my own plan and my stubbornness.

129
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,840
Please chastise me instead.

130
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,350
I wish to speak with this child alone, so you may leave now.

131
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,990
Why didn't you ask for my help?

133
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,950
Are you still unable to trust me or is it... that you're still resentful of me?

134
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,880
Just as I promised, I tried to do my best to protect you...

135
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,120
It seems it wasn't enough to change your feelings.

136
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,650
Since you've said that...

137
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:47,370
If you really want to know, I will ask you this one thing, expecting to die again.

138
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,790
If you really were doing this for me, how could you just leave the left state councillor alone and watch him do this?

139
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,830
You know that Joseon's power as a nation declined after the Japanese Invasion.

140
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,820
I even lost my elite troops in the battle with the Jurchen.

141
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:14,190
However, the Northerners and Yi I Cheom used the Japanese invasion as an excuse to add to and maintain their private armies.

142
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,070
Since you've also suffered because of him,  you should be very well aware of it too.

143
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,030
If I compete now in military strength, I will surely lose.

144
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:29,470
Do you understand now why your father has been unable to oust the lawless Yi I Cheom?

145
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,230
Kim Dae Seok told me this once.

146
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,420
What good is a king who can't protect his loved ones?

147
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,200
His words are true.

148
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,030
What good am I as a king if I cannot protect you?

149
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,370
I'm speechless.

150
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,400
No...

151
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,920
It is I who have put you through such unspeakable things.

152
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,060
I... do have one request.

153
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,520
Tell me anything you want.

154
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,470
Please allow my marriage with Kim Dae Seok.

155
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,080
I wish to live as other women do, as a man's wife—

156
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,670
- That's impossible. 
 - Father.

157
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,580
I've already made arrangements for a new place for you to live in. Make preparations to leave with me instead.

158
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,400
For me... If I am alive...

159
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,270
I wish to live as a living person,

160
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,140
not as a dead person, because I am truly alive.

161
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,950
If I am to be persecuted as a criminal, despite being innocent, and flee for as long as I live and then die unjustly,

162
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,170
I'd rather live as a proud, free woman for one more day, until my inevitable death.

163
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,880
So please... grant your daughter this one wish.

164
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,120
Did Kim Dae Seok order you to do this?

165
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,150
Did he disobey my orders and insist he'll marry you?

166
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,840
That's not the case, Father. This is my own wish.

167
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,990
That man has done nothing wrong except failing to oust me from his home—

168
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,120
Enough!

169
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,000
I... love that man.

170
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,290
Truly and deeply. I love him.

171
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,750
Since Yi I Cheom knows Hwa In is alive, he won't be quiet about it for long.

172
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,820
Never take your eyes off of him for one second and be wary of him at all times.

173
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,610
You must protect Hwa In.

175
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,190
You must... Do you understand?

176
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,600
I will uphold your command.

177
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,110
Has Father returned safely?

178
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,020
Please don't be too upset.

179
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,810
His majesty must have some other predicament that we are not aware of.

180
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,690
I am fine.

181
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,430
It doesn't appear that way...

182
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,710
What do you mean?

183
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,330
You are always worried about me.

184
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,820
I... wish to be a man you can comfortably lean on...

185
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,940
and depend on.

186
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,000
You are already that man.

187
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:06,310
I just felt I needed to see your face for me to sleep at ease.

188
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,840
That is why I waited for you.

189
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,230
Why have you rescued me?

190
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,500
Then why do you worry about me?

191
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,210
If I tell his excellency about this, you too will not be safe.

192
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,820
I have no attachment to my life.

193
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,040
Don't you think about how others would feel about that?

194
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,600
Among my family members... who would cry for my absence?

195
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,640
Isn't her ladyship there for you?

196
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,000
Even for your aunt's sake... please keep a low profile.

197
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,390
Since you have rescued me, I will not report your interference to his excellency.

198
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,820
The king was at his house?

199
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,850
What shall we do?

200
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,490
Don't be a hasty fool.

201
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,720
He may be suspicious, but he has no evidence.

202
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,850
Couldn't the mercenaries leak information?

203
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,010
All of the mercenaries are indebted to Your Excellency.

204
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,560
And their families are here in this house.

205
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,150
They are not ones to lightly open their mouths.  So please do not worry.

206
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,630
Father, his majesty has arrived outside.

207
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,900
Your Majesty, my father is unwell—

208
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
I heard.

209
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,260
I'm paying a visit to make sure he is well, so lead the way.

210
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,220
There is an epidemic of seasonal influenza. I am concerned about Your Majesty's health.

211
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,400
It is best you don't get too close to him.

212
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,420
It doesn't matter to me, so don't worry.

213
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Councillor, I have come.

214
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,090
How is your health?

215
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,960
Fortunately for me...

216
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,660
seeing you personally visit your subject's humble house...

217
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,570
I feel as though I could immediately get up to see you.

218
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,300
I am relieved to hear that.

219
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,790
I am on my way from Kim Dae Seok's home.

220
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,960
Do you have anything to say...  regarding today's events?

221
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,420
I'm sure you and I have much to discuss...

222
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,820
but what is the point of digging up old matters?

223
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,520
Let us bury them and move on.

224
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,400
At a time when the fate of the country hangs in the balance because of internal and external strife,

225
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,310
if you and I doubt and antagonize each other,

226
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,740
what is the future of this country, Joseon?

227
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,690
Please help me as you used to. I need your help.

228
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:32,090
Please punish me for not doing everything in my strength to help you, Your Majesty.

229
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,180
Given all of your great accomplishments, I will pretend to not notice what is already in the past.

230
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,990
I want you to likewise understand that, and make sure something like today's events doesn't happen again.

231
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,030
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

232
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:55,630
I trust you will recover by tomorrow. So I will see you at the palace then.

233
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,560
I'm sure both of you overheard me.

234
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,600
There is more to being filial than to only obey your father's orders.

235
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,410
You must also guide your father on the right path.

236
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,750
Particularly you, Left Police Chief.

237
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,200
Y-yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,990
I will be watching you.

239
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,810
I will make sure to heed your words, Your Majesty.

240
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,970
No need to follow me outside.

241
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,450
Make sure to take care of the councillor.

242
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
You follow me.

243
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,170
Have you given up on Hwa In?

244
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,960
Or is your father more important than her?

245
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,930
Have an answer for me the next time I see you.

246
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,870
What do you plan to do?

247
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,280
Will you do as his majesty pleases?

248
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,330
Father!

249
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,250
The milk is already spilled, and the arrow already fired.

250
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,440
We merely exchanged verbal pleasantries, but his majesty and I...

251
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,940
both realize that we can no longer work together.

252
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,200
Yes. I have already sent men to various locations.

253
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,300
Proceed as planned.

254
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,680
Yes, Father!

255
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,870
Please listen to our pleas.

256
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,390
We cannot continue living like this!

257
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,020
Now!

258
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,750
I sufficiently understand what you came here for.

259
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,320
So you may go back for now.

260
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,910
We can't go back!

261
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,760
We must make our unfair treatment known to the king, so please move aside!

262
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,970
Let's go, everyone!

263
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,950
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

264
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,970
- Move aside! 
 - Who was that just now?!

265
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,340
How dare you strike down a royal guard?

266
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,010
Spare not one man and take them all in!

267
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,380
Who is your leader?

268
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,880
How dare you harm a royal guard?

269
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,890
Won't you answer me this instant?

270
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,490
Continue until they tell the truth!

271
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,700
What does it say?

272
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,520
Oh my goodness.

273
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,160
I heard the commotion. What's going on?

274
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,170
It says that the current king poisoned the late king.

275
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,190
- Is that true? 
 - I don't know how they're running the country.

276
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,700
It says that the current king sucked your blood and sweat to build his new palace.

277
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,600
Please step aside. Return home. Be gone.

278
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,240
Please go home.

279
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,700
Go back to your homes, quickly!

280
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,040
- Stand back. 
 - Please go home.

281
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,820
- Go home. 
 - What are you doing?

282
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,840
Read it.

283
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,790
Didn't I tell you to read it?

284
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,450
The current king

285
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,850
is an unwise king and a foolish king.

286
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,500
What has the king accomplished after ascending the throne?

287
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,080
He built a palace on the blood and sweat of his people.

288
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,260
And he killed his brothers Grand Prince Yeongchang and

289
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,140
Prince Imhae, as well as his nephew Prince Neungchang,

290
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,740
after plotting treason.

291
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,540
In recent days, forgetting the grace and favor bestowed by the Ming Empire,

292
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,850
he joined hands with the barbarians. Generations of kings are sure to lament.

293
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,640
Not only that, the current king conspired with his court lady, of the Kim clan and ...

294
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,470
Finish reading it.

295
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,910
- Your Majesty ... 
 - Read it.

296
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,660
... the current king conspired with his court lady, of the Kim clan and

297
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,560
poisoned the late king.

298
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,800
He is a criminal.

299
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,420
For hearing what must not be heard

300
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,680
and for saying what must not be said, please punish us, Your Majesty.

301
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,840
I will bring water immediately and wash Your Majesty's ears.

302
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
What use is it to wash my ears now?

303
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,770
Unless we cut off the ears of everyone in the capital.

304
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,800
Shall I do that?

305
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,820
Who do you think did this?

306
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,870
The one who created these posters?

307
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,470
It appears to me that it was your father.

308
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,970
What do you think?

309
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,860
I told you to bring me an answer last time, didn't I?

310
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,370
So what is your answer?

311
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,120
Do you choose your father over Hwa In?

312
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,770
When there is no clear evidence ...

313
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,160
deciding who the criminal is based only on belief will cause the real criminal to evade being caught.

314
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,870
- And an innocent victim could... 
 - Innocent?

315
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,570
Then you can just go find the evidence yourself, right?

316
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,080
Go and bring me evidence that your father is not the culprit immediately!

317
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,740
I think you should also start keeping your distance from him from now on.

318
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,820
Blood is thicker than water.

319
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,440
In the end, he will choose his father and his family's reputation.

320
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,400
But who do you intend to seat at the throne?

321
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,650
Do you plan to make the king to abdicate the throne to Crown Prince?

322
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,490
If the crown prince becomes the king,

323
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,580
won't he try to avenge his father?

324
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,300
So then, who... ?

325
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,540
Father, then... ?

326
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,260
Were you looking for me?

327
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,640
The sunshine is nice.  I summoned you because I wanted to take a walk with you.

328
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,280
I'm not interrupting you when you are busy, am I?

329
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,840
Not at all.

330
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,790
I was just thinking to visit you and have a cup of tea.

331
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,210
Let's go.

332
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,940
The flowers know first that spring has arrived.

333
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,810
Isn't it amazing?

334
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,460
Nevertheless, you seem incapable of giving up.

335
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,030
You and your brother's widow, it both cannot happen

336
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,720
and shouldn't happen.

337
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,410
Although the princess was married to my second older brother,

338
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,070
they never met face to face.

339
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,110
I'm not saying this because of your brother.

340
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,430
Then, what is the reason? Is it because of Father?

341
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,480
If it's not that either, is it because people would talk?

342
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Dae Yeop.

343
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,470
I'll only watch her from the sidelines.

344
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,250
I'll  just watch her and protect her forever.

345
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,300
Can't I even do that?

346
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,430
Why travel that rocky path?

347
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,790
Just let go.

348
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,460
Even if you don't think you'd be able to withstand it now,

349
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,960
nothing survives time.

350
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,330
I can't do that.

351
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,080
I will do everything else as you wish,

352
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,200
but I can never give up the princess.

353
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,620
I am sorry.

354
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,940
Is something happening?

355
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,050
Guests have come so his excellency has prohibited any access.

356
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,000
- Do you mean me, too? 
 - Yes.

357
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,030
What about Hyeong?

358
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,300
I guess my brother should know what it's about and I'm not supposed to.

359
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,250
I am sorry.

360
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:21,680
The people's resentment is sky high from the excessive palace reconstruction.

361
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,260
Subjects' homes have been forcefully razed to extend the palace grounds.

362
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,940
The government positions are being sold by issuing government position certificates haphazardly.

363
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,720
Prisoners are being released without proper atonement, if they pay silver.

364
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,590
There are too many problems to list each one by one.

365
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,320
That's why posters like these are being put up.

366
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,040
Worst of all, since the king is about to betray Ming and is ready to join the barbarians,

367
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,500
I can't sleep from worrying about what will become of Joseon in the future.

368
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,200
Then we will gather again soon. Get home safe.

369
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,500
I'll watch the minister of justice,  you watch the chief censor.

370
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,880
Yes.  Be careful.

371
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,530
Welcome, My Lord.

372
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,050
- Are the items inside? 
 - Yes.

373
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,100
- What about that item?   - It's here.

374
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,000
-  It's nice.
 - Yes.

375
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,800
I hear the security around the firearm factory is tighter, but we were able to get these.

376
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,010
Who is that churl?

377
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,920
- Search the perimeter thoroughly! 
 - Yes!

378
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,130
Look.

379
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,670
Look here.

380
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,120
I'm sure the Northerners are up to something, My Lady. Please report it to the king immediately.

381
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,680
You said there is no concrete evidence.  Do you have any?

382
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,600
I still haven't been able to find any.

383
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,830
Where is the left state councillor now?

384
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,210
I heard the Northerners are having frequent meetings.

385
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,360
Are you plotting treason?

386
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,070
Talk of such an ominous event is coming out of your mouth.

387
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,450
The paper you wrapped incense sticks with smells like incense,

388
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,900
and the paper you wrapped fish with, smells like fish.

389
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,790
I can't help but feel

390
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,720
that, even though you deny it,

391
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,000
in your heart you are disloyal.

392
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,310
That is impossible.

393
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,740
From the time he was training as a crown prince until now,

394
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,720
the one who served the king wholeheartedly is me!

395
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,490
Did such a person hold a funeral for a living princess?

396
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,660
Didn't the king himself tell you

397
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,440
not to mention the matter about the princess?

398
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,010
Didn't you also agree with me to never mention

399
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,030
the incident of the poisoned yakbap? 
 (glutinous rice sweet)

400
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,070
I did what I did because you and I believed

401
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,140
the only one who could save Joseon, which was devastated by the Japanese invasion,

402
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,980
was the current king!

403
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,430
But have you had a change of heart now?

404
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,180
The one who changed his mind is the king.

405
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,590
Isn't it the king who is going to kill and devour me

406
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,950
like a useless hound, now that the hunt is over, when I've been loyal to him until now?

407
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,310
The specialty chef who offered that poisoned yakbap ...

408
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,430
Do you know where he is now?

409
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,380
He was put to death at the time.

410
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,830
Are you saying he's not dead but alive?

411
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,150
Did you sneak him off?

412
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,760
Are you curious about that?

413
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,920
If I were in your place, I would be more curious

414
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,930
about what will happen if he opens his mouth.

415
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,550
If that were to happen, what do you expect the king to do?

416
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,600
I think probably

417
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,520
he will blame you, Court Lady Kim, for all the crimes and abandon you.

418
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,160
Am I wrong?

419
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,350
Rather than uselessly digging into me,

420
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,530
why don't you join me?

421
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,440
What do you want?

422
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,410
What do I have to do for you to muffle the specialty chef?

423
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,160
What I want is ...

424
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,580
What happened? What did the left state councillor say?

425
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,530
I have to talk to you. Follow me.

426
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,860
He wants to rescind the restoration of your family status, and princess Hwa In to be handed over.

427
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,970
Then he will shut the specialty chef's mouth.

428
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,630
What do you think of that?

429
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,960
Must I betray his majesty and join hands with the left state councillor?

430
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,810
What is your reason for telling me this?

431
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,820
Please make sure to find the royal chef and kill him.

432
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:31,020
If the royal chef remains alive, I will have no choice but to join hands with the left state councillor.

433
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,540
It's not a matter to ponder.

434
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,350
If his majesty is falsely accused of having killed the late king,

435
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,340
it is inevitable that harm will also come to her highness the princess.

436
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,910
I understand, but

437
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,510
if his majesty succeeds in pushing out Yi I Cheom,

438
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,560
what do you think he will do with her highness the princess?

439
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Please tell me honestly.

440
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,820
The dignity of the royal family must be observed.

441
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,670
Since the princess is not allowed to remarry, Jeong Eob Won will probably be reconstructed and she will be taken there.

442
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:12,770
 (Jeong Eob Won - where royal concubines went after the death of their king, to pray for his happiness in the afterlife)

443
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,000
Daughter-in-law, take a seat here briefly.

444
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,930
Yes, Mother.

445
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,650
You should try using these.

446
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,220
This is face powder.

447
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,220
This is for your lips.

448
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,720
And this is blush.

449
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,080
You should use them.

450
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,890
- I...
 - I have a lot.

451
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,430
You look beautiful without these,

452
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,660
but try them on, since I'm giving them to you.

453
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,050
Thank you, Mother.

454
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,520
I'm back.

455
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,740
Good work.

456
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,040
I have something to tell you. Come inside.

457
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,970
These days I've been occupied with various types of work,

458
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,730
so I wasn't able to ask you.

459
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,720
It's about the queen dowager, your paternal aunt.

460
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,940
The queen dowager?

461
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,170
Yes. You are able to personally meet the king,

462
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,510
so perhaps you can at least ask?

463
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,680
To release the queen dowager from her confinement.

464
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,840
Mother, about that—

465
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,480
Our status was restored and we are living comfortably now, like this,

466
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,330
but her highness the queen dowager, based on what I've heard, this past winter had no firewood,

467
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,800
so she had to burn all her doors and books.

468
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,970
And she has to farm her own food in the palace yard,  because she doesn't have enough to eat.

469
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,130
Does this make any sense?

470
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,690
Gyeongwun palace is heavily guarded by royal soldiers, it's impenetrable as an iron cauldron.

471
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,110
So there is no way for me to visit and greet her.

472
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,330
I'm sorry, Mother.

473
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,880
No, it's fine. Perhaps it's because I am more comfortable

474
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,960
these days that I miss Her Highness the Queen Dowager all the more.

475
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,240
I just wanted to bring it up.

476
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,030
Don't concern yourself over it too much.

477
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,810
You found them already?

478
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,710
You are indeed amazing.

479
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,540
I thought it would take a few months at the very least.

480
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,200
I thought so too, but I got lucky.

481
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,430
Have a drink.

482
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Hyeong-nim, thank you.

483
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,600
If you're grateful, let me eat noodles soon. 
  (= see you get married)

484
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,980
As expected, you're the only one who cares for me.

485
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,420
So Hyeong-nim, about that,

486
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,290
please go back and give them this.

487
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,130
What?

488
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,090
Go along now.

489
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,520
What is this fool doing, not returning yet?

490
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,380
Go into my room.

491
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,850
Why?

492
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,350
You'll know when you get there.

493
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,120
What is that?

494
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,320
You'll know when you see it.

495
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,210
 (Memorial offering to a decedent)

496
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,160
 Dear Sister, I am fine. My family and Mother are all doing fine. Until the day we meet again...

497
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:39,720
How did you find out where my family is?

498
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,830
Now that you read the letter from your brother,

499
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,060
you know your mother and brother's family are doing well.

500
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,620
So don't worry too much.

501
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,820
I also sent them some money through an intermediary.

502
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,580
They won't have to worry about food for a while.

503
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,600
Why are you crying over good news?

504
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,760
You said you would have no regrets if you just hear the  news about if they were alive or not.

505
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,740
I thought they were dead. I thought they were all dead.

506
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,750
Why would they die? A person's life is tenacious.

507
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,490
So stop crying.

508
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,630
And ... How did you know about that?

509
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,410
You told me on that day you drank and passed out.

510
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,090
That the 15th day of this month is your father's death anniversary.

511
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,020
I did?

512
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:58,660
I didn't want to go in and out of your room so I set it up in mine.

513
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,560
You even made precious fried pancakes.

514
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,670
It's just some fried pollack pancakes, that's all.

515
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,760
It's almost ja-si*, so hurry and pay your respects. 
  (11:30-12:30 p.m.)

516
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,590
Why are you out here instead of sleeping?

517
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,890
Thank you.

518
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,900
I thought I wouldn't be able to serve my parents with filial piety until I die,

519
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,710
but thanks to you, I was able to do it once.

520
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,750
I'm also thankful.

521
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,550
Not knowing whether they were alive or dead,

522
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,720
I thought I would die without hearing about them.

523
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,440
It's the first time I've performed my father's ancestral rites.

524
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,240
How long has it been since he passed? You weren't able to do it even once?

525
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,750
I deserve to die.

526
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,010
Same here.

527
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,150
I even sold out her highness the princess, whom I breastfed and raised.

528
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:39,340
That's because you wanted to help your mother and brother's family stay alive.

529
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,970
Why?

530
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,730
What?

531
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,410
Do you have something to say?

532
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,680
Look at the stars.

533
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,240
Where?

534
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,160
That one?

535
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,850
What are you doing?

536
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,690
Dear one.

537
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,770
Live with me.

538
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,320
Live with me.

539
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,080
Do you think you can handle me?

540
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,730
I don't think I can.

541
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,630
But still, I want to try.

542
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,630
If you want to live with me, you need to risk your life.

543
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:33,290
The Grand Rule of Laws say that anyone who takes a woman who was once a court lady or palace maid

544
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,930
will be flogged 100 times. Do you even know that?

545
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,120
Flogging 100 times?

546
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,450
Do I need to get lashed all at once?

547
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,060
Of course, would they do it by installments?

548
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,230
Fine, I'll just take the flogging, no big deal.

549
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,980
No big deal? They say the ignorant are brave.

550
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,560
After 100 floggings, you will die.

551
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,550
People die either way.

552
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:59,530
Since people die anyway, I might as well avoid becoming a bachelor ghost.

553
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,840
Bachelor ghost?

554
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,790
Hey, are you joking right now?

555
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,550
Look me in the eyes.

556
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,650
Does it look like a joke?

557
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,270
Wait, wait.

558
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,960
What? Wait what?

559
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,390
I wasn't ready for that—

560
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,300
Well.

561
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,550
Did you have a pig dream*?
  (In Korea, it means prosperity and abundance)

562
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,780
Why do you look so happy?

563
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,450
Oh, Ba Wu. Let's go and bash that scoundrel councillor's head in.

564
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,790
What's that supposed to mean all of a sudden?

565
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,740
I'm not saying this out of the blue. That councillor bastard has to go away,

566
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:15,260
for the princess and my dear Court Lady Jo to live in peace.

567
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,690
Well, you're right, but...

568
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,390
How can I help?

569
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,540
Just say the word!

570
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,590
Royal specialty chef?

571
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,550
What was his name again?

572
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,830
I'm sure he was a Kim, but was it... Kim Yi...?

573
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,180
Kim Ik?

574
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,230
Oh, do try to think harder!

575
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,810
I forgot it again because of you!

576
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,930
Let me know if you remember.

577
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,720
Why the royal chef out of the blue?

578
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,190
It's a way for us to beat back the left state councillor, so you have to remember it.

579
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,200
I bet the princess would know.

580
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,510
She liked the pogye chicken that he made.

581
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,980
Busaengahsin and  moguosin. 
  (Reciting Chinese characters)

582
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,560
My father brought me into this world, and my mother raised me.    (Corresponding Korean)

583
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,150
Bogihoea and yuipoa.
 ("Elementary Learning", Confucian teachings for children)

584
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,430
She bore me in her womb, and nourished me with her breastmilk.

585
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,880
Iuiona and isikpoa.

586
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,180
They kept me warm with clothes, and with food they kept me full.

587
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,210
Eungoyeocheon and deokhusaji.

588
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:29,060
Their benevolence is as high as heaven. Their virtue is as dense as the earth.

589
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,670
Wiinjaja, galbulwihyo.

590
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,550
And so those who become children, how could they not be filial?

591
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,390
My boy! You're doing great!

592
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,240
She sounds so happy. We should probably ask her later.

593
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,660
Eungoyeocheon.

594
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,680
Please enter.

595
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,500
Make sure nobody gets near.

596
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,400
Especially Dae Yeop. Understand?

597
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,280
Yes, Young Master.

598
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,620
Will you join me in my plan?

599
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,780
Of course we will.

600
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,380
I will make sure to succeed in the deposition of the king,

601
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,330
and share with you the fruits of that achievement.

602
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,990
So you can trust in me.

603
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,970
 Enthrone a new king
 Signed: Yi I Cheom / Yi Won Yeop

604
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,100
It's a list of signers for the agreement.

605
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:37,720
It is a document to ensure nobody here betrays us.

606
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,480
Please everyone sign here.

607
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,540
I will be the first!

608
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,790
 Yun In

609
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,310
 Han Chan Nam

610
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,510
We will depose the current king who is incompetent

611
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:07,410
and with our own hands straighten up the royal family and the country.

612
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,630
The past kings will take care of us.

613
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,280
Why have you come again?

614
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,900
Please leave, before anyone sees you.

615
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,790
I'm here to see the owner of this house, so worry not.

616
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,950
The master?

617
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,190
There are eyes watching, so...

618
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,520
Is he in the men's study?

619
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,440
What brings you here without notice?

620
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,610
I will take care of the issue concerning my father.

621
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:03,820
How?

622
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,590
I will handle it, so you don't need to know.

623
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,660
You always say that you'll handle it.

624
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,140
If you aren't even going to tell, why are you here?

625
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:17,990
I figured you'd do something foolish to interfere and ruin everything.

626
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,520
Will you also keep this from his majesty?

627
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,520
To speak honestly, I cannot trust his majesty.

628
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,690
I do not believe he will keep his promise, even if Father stepped down willingly.

629
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,310
I think so too.

630
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:46,310
I don't know what you might think, but he is still my father.

631
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,480
I am sure it's the same way for you, but I have a duty

632
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,970
to protect my father, my household, and the family name.

633
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:59,170
So... while I will try to stop my father's plan, I will not make him step down.

634
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,260
I won't ask you to understand.

635
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,760
However... this is the best I can do.

636
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,050
I have my own problems...

637
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,860
but you sure do lead a complicated life.

638
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,790
Enough with the frivolities and just answer me.

639
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,270
This is the last time.

640
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,420
I got it.

641
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,990
Please leave.

642
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,520
If her ladyship sees you, it won't be pretty.

643
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,580
What about the princess?

644
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,330
She's doing well.

645
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,790
Have a safe trip home.

646
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,080
It's not what you think. He wasn't here to see the princess, but the master.

647
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,000
Go and ask him—

648
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,860
Now wait, why am I making excuses in front of this man?

649
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,360
I got you.

650
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,430
Work hard!

651
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,020
Go away!

652
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:47,500
I must've been crazy! Why did I drink alcohol that I couldn't handle?

653
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,280
Mother, it is your son Dae Yeop.

654
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,340
 What is it?

655
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,640
I am here to give my nightly greetings.

656
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,250
 It's fine. You can leave.

657
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,220
Yes. Please sleep well.

658
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,340
Father, Mother.

659
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:05,890
 Enthrone A  New King

660
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:10,840
 Yi I Cheom , Yi Won Yeop, Yun In, Han Chan Nam ...

661
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,890
You scoundrel!

662
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,730
I knew you would do this.

663
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,190
You finally show your true colors.

664
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,460
Father, look at what is in his hands.

665
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,340
You mustn't just leave him alone.

666
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:57,400
It's because you always let him off that he's now determined to bring ruin to our family.

667
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,100
You know that we should place great cause before family.

668
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,070
Since he willingly betrayed the family, he is deserving of death.

669
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,410
We must kill him!

670
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,830
Your Highness, the prince.

671
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:56,730
Forgive your sinful subject for taking so long to reveal the truth.

672
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:07,770
You are the sole descendant of the person who rightfully should have been king.

673
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:25,160
Your Highness is not my son...

674
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:32,920
You are the son of Prince Imhae, eldest son of the former king.

675
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:42,380

676
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:48,930
♫  I will cut a day out  ♫

677
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:56,950
♫  among the difficult days of my life  ♫

678
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:58,920
♫  and fill it with your gentle breath  ♫

679
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,540
 Bossam - Steal the Fate Preview

680
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,830
 I will return to you the throne that was usurped.

681
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,560
 I have not even the slightest desire to be king.

682
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:13,210
 If you ascend the throne to be king, you can even take princess Hwa In for yourself.

683
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:20,090
 If you try to use Dae Yeop one more time, then I will tell him the one last secret you've been hiding.

684
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,480
 I feel very unsettled about this. Shouldn't we also try to do something?

685
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,070
 - What do you think if we carry it out on that day?
 - No matter what, I will take the throne!

686
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,560
 Please be my wife.

687
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,780
 I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.

688
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,110
 Do you intend to even kill Hwa In?

689
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,590
 She is already dead.

690
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,510
 Fine. Do as you will.

691
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:42,750
♫   Your voice calling me  ♫
