 Jung Il Woo

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,610
 Kwon Yoo Ri

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,050
 Shin Hyun Soo

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,960

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,060
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,650
Have you lost your mind?

7
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,100
Where do you think this is? Leave at once!

8
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,630
Talk to me. Has something happened?

9
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,570
Then why are you doing this?

10
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,590
Are you really all right?

11
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,360
Are you... not hurt anywhere?

12
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,240
Not in pain?

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,280
As you can see...

14
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm normally as sturdy as a rock, so none of this hurts me.

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,560
Don't worry about me, and take care of yourself.

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,660
Your face has gotten quite haggard.

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,310
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,950
You suffer injustice because of me.

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,290
It's because of me... When the sinner is me.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,370
Did someone die?

21
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,580
Please go back.

22
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,120
I said, leave!

23
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,580
And... don't ever come back again.

24
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,630
 A dead man who isn't dead. Such a lonely and painful life!

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,030
 How were you able to withstand it all this time?

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,220
 What are you going to do with all of that injustice?

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,800
 Both your revenge and your family ...

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,910
 Did you give all of that up for me?

29
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,780
♫  The boat sails as if dancing  ♫

30
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,020
♫   Suddenly my heart also flows  ♫

31
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:27,120
♫  And that is how it scatters  ♫

32
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,080
Here, if you take a sip of this, it'll warm your belly right up. 
  Episode 11

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,840
- I shouldn't drink while on duty... 
 - Nonsense!

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,220
What can't you do in the land of Joseon?

35
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,230
Be flexible! Flexible!

36
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,150
Good! Now, if you're all done with that... cocka doodle doo!

37
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,130
Now... here you go!

38
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,860
Enjoy.

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,220
And me too... I-I mean you can have it.

40
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,970
It's roasted well. It's roasted well.

41
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,980
Have you calmed down now?

42
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,690
I think it's best you return now.

43
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,550
And... don't come back again.

44
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,120
- You mustn't ever come back. Understand? 
 - But...

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,860
If you do this and get into trouble because of me...

46
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,210
Then I may really go crazy.

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,550
So please... do as I say. Understand?

48
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,620
Why aren't you answering?

49
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,700
I understand.

50
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,950
I understand... so you promise me too.

51
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,920
Until we meet again, promise you'll make sure not to die.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,760
That you will stay alive, no matter what.

53
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,790
Do you think people die because they want to?

54
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,150
I'm saying, don't risk your life for my sake any longer.

55
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,420
I no longer want to see you in danger because of me.

56
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,030
I got it.

57
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,550
No matter what it takes, I'll try to keep my neck intact.

58
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,840
Don't speak so lightly about it. Promise me properly.

59
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,600
No matter the cost... I'll make sure to return to your side in one piece.

60
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,050
So until then... please wait for me in safety.

61
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,190
I understand.

62
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,130
What we couldn't say here, let's talk about it then.

63
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,780
Isn't there anything you need?

64
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,760
I do have one request.

65
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,520
What about Ba Wu? What happened to him?

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,430
He isn't hurt anywhere, right?

67
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,660
Let's go. We'll talk when we're back.

68
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,560
Give this letter to the head monk in Sangwon Temple, and explain the current situation to him.

69
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,190
- Wait, what kind of letter is this? 
 - It's from Cha Dol's father.

70
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,030
While I don't know the details, he said it was urgent. So you must leave at once.

71
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,990
But what do you plan to do by yourself?

72
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,220
Don't worry about me, and hurry.

73
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,020
Ah, yes.

74
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,630
Please follow me.

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
Had you known all along?

76
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,130
So you have.

77
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,170
Are you talking about the fact that he's the grandson of Lord Kim Je Nam*? 
 (the previous queen's father)

78
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,370
Or... that in order to kill him...

79
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,170
the fact that his mother and sister are held hostage?

80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,600
Whether he is Ba Wu or Kim Dae Seok is not important to me.

81
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,360
He is someone I owe a debt of gratitude, who both rescued me and allowed me to live

82
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,300
Who I now realized is a pitiable man who had given up his resentment and vengeance for my sake.

83
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,890
That fact alone pierces my heart to endless sorrow.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,680
If you would give up that man... he will live.

85
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,930
I will spare him.

86
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,570
You need only to say that you'll give up on him.

87
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,300
- With just those words alone— 
 - I...

88
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,590
Shall I promise a lie for you?

89
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,830
Please don't do anything

90
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,900
for my sake any longer.

91
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,730
Whatever you do, do it for your own sake.

92
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,670
 It is for my sake.

93
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,590
 I am doing this for my own sake.

94
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,590
Your Highness, where have you been all this time?

95
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,870
There is something about Cha Dol's father you must know.

96
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,930
That accursed... what's so wrong about selling a few books?

97
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,170
It looked like you were acquainted with the nobleman who captured us.

98
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,800
What do you think will happen to us?

99
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,910
What are you saying?

100
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,870
Cha Dol's father is Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson...

101
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,320
And his excellency is planning treason?

102
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,690
Oh my... oh my... how could such a thing ...?

103
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,090
Wait...

104
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,160
Then do you mean the young master knew this all along?

105
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,090
I mean, they're enemies with one another.

106
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,590
Then if the young master only opens his lips...

107
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,560
Then that man Ba Wu is as good as dead, isn't he?

108
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,790
Oh my... what shall we do?

109
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,940
 Jeong Gap Nam, Year of birth: Gapjin*
(year of the blue dragon, 1604)

110
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,470
It's an identity badge. Memorize what it says.

111
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,120
- Thank you. 
 - I'm not doing it for your sake, so don't thank me.

112
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,050
You just worry about keeping that bookstore owner quiet.

113
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
I got it.

114
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,840
 Jeong Gap Nam, born in year gapjin

115
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,780
- Why aren't you sleeping? 
 - I can't sleep.

116
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:23,010
I suppose it would be weirder if you slept soundly in this situation.

117
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,510
It's not that...

118
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,070
Is it because you want to see Chil Seong?

119
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,550
- No. 
 - Then?

120
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,150
I'm so hungry. I can't sleep.

121
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,690
Come here. Come here, my child.

122
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,850
You must steel yourself.

123
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,880
No matter what happens, we must protect your brother.

124
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,140
Understand?

125
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,950
Don't worry.

126
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,650
Even if I starve to death, I will lock my lips and throw away the key.

127
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,270
That's my girl.

128
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,400
 The day after tomorrow at sulshi*, bring my mother and sister to the shrine in front of Sungnye Gate 
 (hour of the dog: 7 p.m. - 9 p.m.)

129
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,850
 If you try to pull any tricks, this will go straight to the king's hands.

130
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,990
Sir Monk! Are you inside?

131
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,380
Sir Mo—

132
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,990
What he's wearing on his head...

133
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,490
Don't worry too much.

134
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,000
They're not even erotic books. He'll just receive a few strokes of the whip and be set free.

135
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,550
How I wish that were the case!

136
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,340
Don't you see the covering over his face?

137
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,040
It means he's charged with serious crimes.

138
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,900
It's merely a few drawings. How could they be serious crimes?

139
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,310
Let's go.

140
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,740
Let's go now.

141
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,760
You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. You'll collapse at this rate!

142
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,590
Have you returned?

143
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,340
You're hungry, right? Let's go inside. I'll make some food for you.

144
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,900
The head monk is here.

145
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,770
It looks like they missed each other...

146
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,500
How could things go this awry?

147
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,740
It's nothing! Here, eat.

148
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,280
Here.

149
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,370
The plan is all set.

150
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,610
Even if Ba Wu isn't there, as long as I have the letter,

151
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,640
at least I could've attempted to do something as we planned.

152
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,390
But now that I don't have the letter...

153
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,900
Isn't there any way to delay the date?

154
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,050
Yi I Cheom wouldn't give up on the letter that easily either.

155
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,610
He may even listen to our demands.

156
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,880
And then, we may be able to regroup and try again.

157
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,660
Yes.

158
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,520
If that Chun Bae fellow returns safely with the letter,

159
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,980
then we can look for a way to notify them.

160
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,030
But for today, there isn't a way

161
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,110
to notify them before the appointed time.

162
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,510
Isn't there a way we could do it through the youngest master?

163
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,190
- Are these the ruffians? 
 - Yes.

164
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,820
This one drew the pictures, and the other sold the books.

165
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,870
Good work. Lock them up and prepare them for questioning.

166
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,950
Yes, sir. Take them away.

167
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,770
Have you found anything?

168
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,200
- It's a ledger of the sales. 
 - Really?

169
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,340
He must be a meticulous fellow. He kept detailed records of all transactions in this book. Take a look.

170
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,490
I will look at it later. This isn't important right now.

171
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,150
Has something happened?

172
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,980
Follow me.

173
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,190
You mean Father is planning to depose the king?

174
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,490
It was a last resort. But with this incident with the princess turning the king against him,

175
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,830
he resolved himself to do this. He can't sit idly by and do nothing, can he?

176
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,750
Was this father's sole doing? Or does he have a partner?

177
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,760
The plan was to send the letter to Head Eunuch Wei and get his approval.

178
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Father intended to use the approval as a way to muster support.

179
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,290
We must find that letter at all costs.

180
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,850
If by chance that letter falls into the king's hands, our family is done for.

181
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,460
Go home for now. I'll just finish the urgent matters here and follow shortly.

182
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,300
Yes.

183
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,260
 Yeong A Bu In

184
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,130
 Mu In Bu A

185
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,390
Read it.

186
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,220
Yeong A Bu In. Mu In Bu A.

187
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,200
What does it mean?

188
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,320
Cao Cao, Emperor Wu of Wei said "I'd rather do wrong to others

189
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,280
than allow them to do wrong to me."

190
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,550
That is my will and the reason why I prepared to depose the king.

191
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,150
You were kind-hearted and upright since your childhood years.

192
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,480
Once you gave your heart to someone, you'd be unable to betray them.

193
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,690
For the princess's sake, you hesitated to take the civil service exam,

194
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,840
because you don't want to support me at cabinet meetings when I oppose the king.

195
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,860
The reason you put off marrying Lord Nae Am's granddaughter was also the same.

196
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,410
Am I wrong?

197
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm sorry.

198
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,400
If I rushed you, I thought you'd go farther astray,

199
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,890
so I pretended to not notice.

200
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,790
Now the princess is dead.

201
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,470
And it seems you've had a change of heart.

202
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,250
So I will ask once again.

203
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,200
Will you follow your father's will?

204
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,430
Yes, Father.

205
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,020
I will never again disappoint you.

206
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,670
Good. That is what you should do.

207
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,570
Father. I've finished the work at the office.

208
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,320
Yes.

209
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,190
- Have you finished preparations? 
 - Yes.

210
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,670
Lead the way.

211
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,150
Yes.

212
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,390
Where are you planning to drag us now?

213
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,660
We're letting you see your son, so follow us.

214
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,090
I'm not going. No, I can't go.

215
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,070
Rather ...!

216
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,790
Rather you kill me!

217
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,520
Do you think I'd obediently become your bait?!

218
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,460
There is no way, you bastards!

219
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,770
What are you doing? Drag her away at once!

220
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,830
You will receive divine punishment!

221
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,820
Are you not even afraid of the heavens? You bastards deserving of death!

222
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,860
Kill me! Kill me!

223
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,190
I'd rather you kill me now!

224
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,730
Silence.

225
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,230
If you don't quietly follow us, I will cut your daughter down before we leave.

226
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,250
M-Mother!

227
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,790
Let's go.

228
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,560
- Come look over here before you go. 
 - Welcome!

229
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,760
We have anchovies here. Anchovies!

230
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,530
Come take a look.

231
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,120
- Sir, come look here before you go. 
- Buy some anchovies!

232
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,220
- Take a look before you go. 
 - Buy some.

233
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,230
I'll give you a good price.

234
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,140
Isn't it sulshi* already?
  ("hour of the dog": 7 p.m.-9 p.m.)

235
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,690
Yes.

236
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,440
It's been an hour since sunset. So it should already be.

237
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,240
It must be sulshi now, right?

238
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,310
It must have passed for quite some time.

239
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,400
Didn't you notice how long it's been since it got dark?

240
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,420
Come here!

241
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,910
Move!

242
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,400
That should be the curfew bell.
  (In-jeong: The bell rings 28 times around 10 p.m., closing of city gates)

243
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,110
Just look at how foolish you appear!

244
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,370
He was an intelligent child who was lauded as a prodigy before he was even a toddler.

245
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,650
Do you think that same child would fall for such an obvious trap whilst you wait for him?

246
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,000
Even if the heavens split apart, that will never happen.

247
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,010
Don't even dream of it!

248
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,250
Quiet!

249
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,300
Who do you think you're saying such disrespectful things to, you peasant?

250
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,410
What should we do?

251
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,350
If he were going to come, he would've been here already.

252
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,120
Let's go back.

253
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,740
He wouldn't have not shown up on purpose.

254
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,950
I think something unexpected came up.

255
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,860
He broke into this room and threatened this country's left state councillor.

256
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,120
Even if it's for his mother and sister, it's not something he could pull off

257
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,920
without putting his life on the line.

258
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,340
To think he would suddenly decide he doesn't care about his mother and sister...

259
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,380
Do you think this is possible?

260
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,950
Are you saying we should wait and see?

261
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,300
Yes. Anyway we don't have any other choice, do we?

262
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,650
And if he really gives up that letter to the king?

263
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,950
If he had that intent, why would he risk his life to come here?

264
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,330
He could've gone straight to the king.

265
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,240
 If I die, so will you.

266
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,560
 Do you think I'm afraid of dying?

267
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,210
 You may not fear death,

268
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,410
 but you will fear your mother and sister dying.

269
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,490
 Damn it. I knew this would happen.

270
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,130
 It's no surprise how much evil men scheme.

271
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,630
Let's wait for now.

272
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,000
Father! If something happens to that letter—

273
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,640
As long as his mother and sister are in our hands, that will never happen.

274
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,650
But just to be safe, take a portion of the men and have them hide.

275
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,690
And either have new weapons crafted or move what is in storage to a different location.

276
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,080
Yes.

277
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,990
But... would that be enough preparation?

278
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,250
If you're still feeling uneasy, there is another way.

279
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,380
We can try to sound out his majesty.

280
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,810
With the banned book.

281
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,230
Didn't you say that it was Kim Ja Jeom who made an uproar about this novel and used it to attack you, Hyeong-nim?

282
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,060
Why don't we take this chance to teach him and the Westerners some manners?

283
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,740
Attack the Westerners to shake his majesty's resolve, you say?

284
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,270
Yes. If by chance the letter falls into the king's hands...

285
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,830
in order to protect the Westerners, he will have no choice but to use the letter.

286
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,770
But... if he stays his hand despite the Westerners suffering an attack...

287
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,110
Then it's proof that the letter is not yet in his hands.

288
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,340
Father, this is a great idea!

289
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,950
We sound out the king, and we send a clear warning to the Westerners who rely on his favor.

290
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,360
Are we not killing two birds with one stone?

291
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,800
Do we have enough proof to attack the Westerners?

292
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,930
Yes. In the confiscated trade ledger, there's a record of every person who purchased or borrowed the book.

293
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,260
Are there none from our side?

294
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,040
There are some, but thankfully they are few.

295
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,600
As long as we remove any that might cause problems, then it's fine, isn't it?

296
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,130
This cannot have any mistakes, so make sure to carry this out flawlessly.

297
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,790
Yes.

298
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,150
Guard this place well.

299
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,950
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

300
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,040
What brings you here?

301
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,360
I need to check on something.

302
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,990
Why did you come here again?

303
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,520
Did you not hear that you will not get a single word from me?

304
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,760
Please do not act recklessly.

305
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,740
Especially in front of my father, you must seal your lips and ears tightly.

306
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,950
If you want to see your son alive again, make sure to heed my words.

307
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,490
Did you find what you wanted, Young Master?

308
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,320
She doesn't easily talk.

309
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,820
They are a stubborn bunch.

310
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,960
But... surely they will change their mind after starving for a few days?

311
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,130
Put it down.

312
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Did you not hear me?

313
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,230
Do you not have any sense of self-respect?

314
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,390
It hasn't been that long since you swore to never eat or drink anything those bastards offered!

315
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,350
Are we nobles?

316
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,500
The idea that we should rather starve to death than lose face or decency is something nobles do, isn't it?

317
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,860
But we're no longer nobles, are we?

318
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,790
It doesn't matter if commoners like us starve to death.

319
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,420
You foolish child.

320
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:16,300
Your only brother may die by his enemy's hands any moment.

321
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,660
And you're taking their food?!

322
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,130
Can you actually swallow that?

323
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,990
Why would Orabeoni* die? 
  (Older brother)

324
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,180
He has stayed well hidden up until now.

325
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,900
He just needs to keep hiding as he has—

326
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,190
He saw us captured with his own two eyes...

327
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,330
Do you think he'll just sit idly by?

328
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:44,580
If something happens to him because of you and me ...

329
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,530
Do you think I'm happy about this?

330
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
What happiness could a wench have after being captured while getting married?

331
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,360
I didn't want to also mope around weeping, so I'm pretending not to.

332
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm also scared to death, thinking of what might happen to Orabeoni!

333
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,070
Sit.

334
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,380
Did you come looking for your father's letter?

335
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,090
Why act surprised? I was supposed to meet your father yesterday, so you would've heard all about it.

336
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,060
What did you do with the letter? Do you have it with you now?

337
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:04,390
Why? Are you also afraid that you'd become a traitor's son like me?

338
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,850
Don't worry.

339
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,570
Just like you have no interest in my identity,

340
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,400
I also don't care if your father deposes the king or commits treason.

341
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,660
I simply need to save my mother and sister.

342
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,770
I know. That is why I haven't told Father yet.

343
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,830
I'm thankful for that.

344
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,890
That letter... where is it now?

345
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,260
Surely you aren't expecting an answer from me, right?

346
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,600
If your identity is exposed, then the princess herself could be in danger. So even I must know.

347
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,630
If they inspect your body it could mean trouble. So if you have it with you, give it to me now.

348
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,290
I don't have it.

349
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,420
I understand.

350
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,990
I won't ask where it is.

351
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:09,980
But in turn... promise me that you won't do anything reckless with that letter.

352
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,860
Do you trust my promise?

353
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't like you, but I know you aren't one to go back on your word.

354
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,950
I have a plan to rescue you and your mother.

355
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,110
Can you likewise trust me and follow what I say?

356
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,610
 Ledger

357
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,180
Start.

358
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,150
Yes.

359
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,160
Just a moment.

360
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,160
Skip this name.

361
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,770
Copy it starting with this name.

362
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,080
Y-y-yes, I understand.

363
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,470
The Town magistrate of Pyeongsan, Yi Gui. The deputy commander of the Royal Investigations Bureau, Jeong Gu Yul.

364
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,540
An official of the Office of Censors, Kim Yong Bu. The Royal Secretary of the minister of defense, Min Han Sang ... among others.

365
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,600
Their wives and daughters borrowed the banned book and read it.

366
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,170
- And— 
 - There's more?

367
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:35,400
Unbelievably, Prince Neungyang's consort Han is also included.

368
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
Is that true?

369
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,130
It's the truth, with nothing added or taken away.

370
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,400
Bring it here.

371
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,900
Your Majesty, I, your Inspector General, Nam Geun, would like to cautiously beseech you.

372
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:06,070
You must harshly punish the criminals who have broken the national law and treated your royal orders lightly.

373
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,490
Your Majesty, I beg you to hear our pleas.

374
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,310
- We beg you to hear our pleas! 
 - We beg you to hear our pleas!

375
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,680
I, your Chief Censor Yun In, cautiously beseech you.

376
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,040
It is said that to govern the country, one must govern oneself and one's family successfully.

377
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,610
In particular for Prince Neungyang!

378
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,230
Because he forgot his position and in order to pay for his crime of compromising the honor of the royal family,

379
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,640
you must punish him more harshly.

380
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,250
I beg you to hear my plea.

381
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,910
- We beg you to hear our plea. 
 - We beg you to hear our plea.

382
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,370
We can't judge every misdeed on account of a single ledger alone.

383
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,850
Move the criminals to the Royal Investigation Bureau at once. I will question them there.

384
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,450
I don't think he knows about the letter.

385
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,380
Still, just to be safe, tell our people in the palace to keep their ears open.

386
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,450
Yes.

387
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,640
Once the criminals involved with the banned book are moved to the investigation bureau,

388
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,090
it's obvious Kim Ja Jeom will want to question them.

389
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,020
Did you make sure to control their mouths?

390
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,130
That is why, just to be safe, Dae Yeop is now at the left police station.

391
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,580
You did well.

392
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,880
For this kind of matter, it's better that as few people as possible know about it.

393
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,100
As expected,  you can only trust your bloodline.

394
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,380
Dae Yeop has changed his attitude, so make sure to take good care of him.

395
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,690
Yes, Father.

396
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,080
That fool Kim Ja Jeom has made a mess of things again.

397
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,320
But for now...

398
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,550
Yi I Cheom is determined to fight back, what could he possibly do in response?

399
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:56,800
If things continue this way, the three Westerners you were barely successful in promoting will be overturned.

400
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,790
Even Prince Neungyang, like his brother Prince Neungchang can be framed for treason—

401
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,050
Quiet!

402
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,480
Is Jung Yeong outside?

403
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,950
When the criminals are moved to the Royal Investigation Bureau, have them all killed!

404
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:25,550
If you just kill them it could cause great confusion, what about making it appear as if they committed suicide?

406
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,640
Do as you see fit.

407
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,220
I must rest. Both of you take leave.

408
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,020
What's happened? What did His Majesty say—

409
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,970
This mess happened because I listened to you. You were the one to cause it, so you take care of it now.

410
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,570
If something were to happen to Prince Neungyang because of this,

411
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,760
know that you will likewise not be safe.

412
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,810
Do you understand?

413
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,300
The Royal Investigation Bureau?!

414
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,150
Yes, the Royal Investigation Bureau.

415
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,960
Your father-in-law, that is that councillor bastard... I mean... his excellency the councillor ...

416
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,390
You may speak freely.

417
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,690
So it seems that councillor bastard is using the banned book to swallow up all of the Westerners.

418
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,340
Those terrible people. They read it too.

419
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,880
What are you talking about? Speak clearly.

420
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,720
So they took the ledger and completely erased any name associated with the Great Northern faction.

421
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,670
And they claimed that only the Westerners read it.

422
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,150
The king must have completely lost his mind in utter outrage.

423
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,390
Maybe the original ledger containing the bookstore transactions is in the capital?

424
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,060
That's already been confiscated.

425
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,980
But what do you want with that?

426
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:30,360
If, as you say, the Great Northerners read the book alongside the Westerners... rather than highlighting the problem, wouldn't they cover it up?

427
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,380
Then Cha Dol's father would be easily freed also.

428
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,510
Can't you steal that kind of thing?

429
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,620
How do we know where it is?

430
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,490
And with what skills do I steal that?

431
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,320
If I had that kind of skill I would pull Ba Wu out.

432
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,800
They say even if you're desperate enough to use dog crap as medicine, you'll find none. They were talking about you.

433
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,140
When they set up the interrogation court or whatever it's called, then that councillor bastard will see Ba Wu's face, won't he?

434
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,620
Would he keep Ba Wu alive after seeing his face?

435
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,380
Let's go!

436
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,710
Let us go.

437
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,410
Does something bother you?

438
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,480
It would be better if we found a way to make him never to open his mouth again.

439
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,150
Do you mean to kill him to keep him quiet?

440
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,180
Wouldn't that be the safest way?

441
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,720
If only that were possible, it would be ideal, but... this isn't within the left police's jurisdiction, how could we—

442
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,290
Whether we hire an assassin or get one of the Investigation Bureau members involved, we have to do something.

443
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,560
The possibility of failure is too big.

444
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,040
Just leave it to me instead. I'll take care of it.

445
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,110
You will?

446
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:07,100
If you can arrange for a visitation, I can handle this without getting personally involved.

447
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,160
Kill that bookstore owner.

448
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,700
You've gone crazy.

449
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,750
Don't you know that if he opens his mouth, the princess will be endangered?

450
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,380
Don't worry. He won't ever open his mouth.

451
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,860
Didn't you promise me to follow my plan?

452
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:32,370
You must kill him within the night.

453
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,060
Stop shaking your leg! I can't think straight because of you.

454
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,500
It's because I feel so frustrated.

455
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,440
No matter how I think about it, getting that ledger is the only way to rescue Cha Dol's father.

456
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,740
How would you even know where to find it?

457
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,450
The left police office confiscated it, so surely it fell into the left police chief's hands.

458
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,880
You're correct.

459
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,340
They don't trust anyone, so they will definitely be keeping it in their house.

460
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,090
We have to steal that ledger.

461
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,880
I understand. No matter what it takes, I will—

462
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,360
No, I will go.

463
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,590
What?

464
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,600
You were locked in that storehouse the entire time. You don't know that place very well, do you?

465
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,840
You can't. You absolutely cannot.

466
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,120
Don't even dream of it.

467
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,630
I must go. No matter what you say I won't change my mind, so don't try.

468
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,630
Your Highness, it would be better to ask the young master...

469
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,160
I cannot.

470
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,470
How could I make such a shameless request?

471
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:45,620
You said the young master would save Cha Dol's father if you would follow his lead.

472
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:51,090
Cha Dol's father will also want you to be together with the young master.

473
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,780
Wait, what are you talking about? Why would she follow the young master?

474
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,160
You stay still.

475
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,690
Does it look like I can stay still?

476
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,300
You know what Ba Wu was thinking as he was dragged away.

477
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,120
And now you think she should follow the young master? Are you talking or passing gas?

478
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,540
I told you to stay still.

479
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,670
We must save the man and then see.

480
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,580
That's why we're going to steal the ledger!

481
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,690
You both stop.

482
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,380
- But Your Highness— 
 - Nanny...

483
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,380
The matter will be resolved if the ledger is found. So you stop too.

484
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,650
Then I shall follow you.

485
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,080
Nanny...

486
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,110
I will be your lookout.

487
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,790
I know that house better than this man.

488
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,010
Anyhow,  just know that I will follow you even if I die.

489
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,850
 Kill that bookstore owner.

490
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:51,220
 Don't you know that if he opens his mouth, the princess will be endangered?

491
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,500
 You must kill him within this night.

492
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,920
Hyeong-nim!  Hyeong-nim!  Hyeong-nim!  Wake up!

493
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,890
Hyeong-nim, wake up! Hurry!

494
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,800
It's an assassin! Stop him from opening the door!

495
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,660
Who are you?  Make known your identity!

496
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,330
Hyeong-nim Man Su.

497
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,750
Hyeong-nim!  Hyeong-nim!

498
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,870
Do you know who that might have been?

499
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,660
He's someone your father sent, right?

500
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,740
It's not Father.

501
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,400
Are you sure?

502
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,100
If it's not your father who sent him, then who...?

503
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,630
Yi I Cheom's youngest son prevented it?

504
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

505
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,770
The man who bossam'ed Hwa In and Yi I Cheom's youngest have teamed up, you say?

506
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,410
You said those two men were with Hwa In back then too, didn't you?

507
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,050
Yes.

508
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,290
So it was Ba Wu who was captured in Jemulpo.

509
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,280
Go right now to Jemulpo and thoroughly search his neighborhood.

510
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,100
It's a certainty that it's the work of His Majesty.

512
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,780
He's muffled the witnesses to save the Westerners.

513
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,110
I think so also.

514
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,520
It seems certain that my letter is not in his majesty's hands.

515
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,950
Yes.

516
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,330
Why didn't you let him kill them both, while he was at it?

517
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,990
It wasn't a good situation.

518
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,440
No.

519
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:11,120
In any case, the person who published and circulated the banned books knows the inside story.

520
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,520
The person who drew the pictures knows nothing, does he?

521
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,440
You've worked hard. Go and rest now. Won Yeop, you too.

522
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,890
Yes.

523
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,200
I wonder what the king will say tomorrow morning during sangcham*. 
  (Morning royal audience)

524
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,070
I don't know if I'll be able to sleep.

525
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,660
What is this I hear about an assassin finding his way into the Royal Investigation Bureau? What on earth were the investigators doing?

526
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,380
Are the officers of the bureau nothing but mere scarecrows?

527
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,940
What were they doing with all of that military aides and troops?

528
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,480
If you have mouths, tell me.

529
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,720
Are your mouths glued shut?! Why are you so quiet?!

530
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,480
Your Majesty.

531
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,370
Left State Councilor Lee Yi Cheom beseech you.

532
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,160
Speak.

533
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,000
Rather than castigating the officials of the Royal Investigation Bureau,

534
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,010
I think it is a higher priority to unmask who sent the assassin.

535
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,590
I believe that is what is right.

536
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,800
We must catch the assassin to unmask his identity.

537
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,140
Will you catch them?

538
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,820
Even if we can't catch the assassin,

539
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,010
we can guess who sent him.

540
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:33,600
There is someone who receives a benefit as a result of this crime.

541
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,730
When they go so far as to send an assassin to kill a criminal imprisoned by the investigation bureau,

542
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:45,330
it is clear they are trying to hide their own sins by killing the witness.

543
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,460
If we catch and interrogate those who saw the banned book

544
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,320
I am sure you will learn who sent the assassin.

545
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,150
Please give the order to investigate the ones who looked at the banned book.

546
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:04,860
Until the interrogation court is set up and we check that way, we cannot determine the right and wrong of this matter.

547
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,600
Hurry and prepare to open the interrogation court.

548
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

549
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,400
Your humble servant checked everything. No one on our side sent the assassin.

550
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,810
Could it possibly be His Majesty—

551
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,840
How dare you think something so disrespectful.

552
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,100
I'm sorry. Your humble servant is so frustrated.

553
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,270
But, just in case, I will go to the Royal Investigation Bureau again to verify.

554
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,680
If you have the time to do such useless things

555
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,030
look for a way to block Yi I Cheom.

556
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,510
- Open it. 
 - Yes.

557
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,110
Why are you here? Are you the one who drew the picture?

558
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,690
Yes.

559
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,080
I thought you'd go somewhere far away to hide and live.

560
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,580
Somehow, it turned out this way.

561
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,330
You and Princess Hwa In always leave a tempest in your wake.

562
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,790
Where in the prison?

563
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,810
It's this way.

564
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,180
Did you see the assassin, by chance?

565
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,150
I did see him, but he was disguised so I couldn't see his face.

566
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,350
I have one request.

567
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,630
Tell me.

568
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,110
Yi I Cheom knows my face.

569
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,880
Please prevent him from coming here.

570
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,070
He'll be there anyway when the interrogation court opens.

571
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,250
You only need to prevent him until then.

572
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,910
You can't go inside.

573
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,590
What?

574
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:25,760
His Majesty has forbidden outsider access.

575
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:33,290
Outsider? What do you mean outsider? You're saying Father and I are outsiders?

576
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:39,150
The left state minister said this morning that there must be a culprit who would benefit from this assassination.

577
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,270
Who knows? The left police office could have fabricated the evidence,

578
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,620
and killed the witness to silence him?

579
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,630
You must really want to die.

580
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,820
How dare you speak such absurdities?

581
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,170
Don't forget that the mouth is a door that brings calamity.

582
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,890
- Let us go. 
- Father.

583
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,800
Now is not the right time.

584
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,140
If it wasn't them either, who killed him?

585
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,930
Who are you?

586
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,810
Who are you that you're snooping around someone's house like a stray cat?

587
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,940
I'm not snooping around. I know the owner of this house—

588
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,430
You're the son of this house.

589
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,010
I'm not.

590
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:04,340
Hey, you'll be punished if you lie to an adult.

591
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,510
Do you know me?

592
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:13,770
I do. Are there no adults at home?

593
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,260
I heard that you have a mother.

594
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,090
Surely you're not living alone here.

595
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,980
Do you understand that whatever happens, you must protect the princess?

596
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,410
Don't worry. If it seems dangerous, I'm going to run away.

597
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,720
I'm trusting in only you.

598
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,620
Only me?

599
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,710
What's wrong with you, seriously?

600
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,220
My vitality is ready to burst.

601
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,860
Court Lady Jo.

602
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,050
Get down.

603
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,340
- What? 
- Get down.

604
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,360
Sit down there a minute.

605
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,630
Which way to the men's quarters?

606
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,430
Wait.

607
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,590
- This way. 
 - W-wait!

608
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,050
Who is it?

609
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,980
Is that you, Wife?

610
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,380
Who are you?

611
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,170
Thief!

612
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,220
It's a thief!

613
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,700
Who are you?!

614
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,990
It's a thief!

615
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,000
Is there anyone out there?!

616
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,400
To the women's quarters, the women's quarters! Go after him!

617
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,290
Are you all right, my lord?

618
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,930
Hey, you useless fools!

619
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,060
Hurry and go after him!

620
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,260
It's that way!

621
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,130
Give chase.

622
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,150
It's this way.

623
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,420
This way! This way!

624
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,740
Come over here.

625
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,560
Catch your breath.

626
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,920
You have to search everywhere.

627
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,560
You, go that way.

628
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,700
Hurry!

629
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,840
It's that way. Catch them.

630
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,620
Catch them.

631
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Stop!

632
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,070
Catch them!

633
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,920
Catch them.

634
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,040
Catch them.

635
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,940
What's happened?

636
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,650
There was a thief in the house so I checked to see if you were safe.

637
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,050
A thief?

638
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,540
There was much commotion outside. Did you not know?

639
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,580
If I had known would I have been here like this?

640
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,930
It's been a while since I last had alcohol... it must be why I slept so deeply.

641
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:00,140
So did you catch the thief?

642
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,800
We lost him.

643
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,770
Who would dare?

644
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,380
Could it be Kim Dae Seok?

645
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:14,020
Seeing how he was discovered in your older brother's chamber, I don't think it was him.

646
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,400
Still, we don't know. Check the annex.

647
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,410
- I will come right out too. 
 - Yes.

648
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,140
 Ledger

649
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,910
It was the young master?

650
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,680
When the young master is helping you this much

651
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,060
can't you turn your heart—

652
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,280
What are you so constantly turning?

653
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,720
What about the affections we've grown for each other?

654
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,690
Why are you always on the young master's side?

655
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,090
I've watched over the young master for over 20 years.

656
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,990
Even if she doesn't go to the young master there must be a way to save Ba Wu.

657
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,260
If worse comes to worst, we can always trade the letter for the ledger, so don't worry too much about it.

658
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,620
But we need that letter to rescue Ba Wu's mother and sister.

659
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,530
Let's save Cha Dol's father for now, and then we can find another way.

660
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,820
I don't know if Ba Wu would like this.

661
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,500
Go home first. Cha Dol will be waiting.

662
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,450
You are home.

663
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,940
Yes, Cha Dol. Nothing much happened, right?

664
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,040
There was nothing much, but...

665
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,610
there was a suspicious man who looked around the house and then left.

666
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,690
- What?  
 - A suspicious man?

667
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:38,110
There's a strange book I've never seen before in the bedroom.

668
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:39,620
- S-strange—  
- Go inside.

669
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,050
Go inside, go inside, go inside.

670
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,050
Cha Dol, you stay in your room for a moment.

671
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,560
Yes.

672
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,320
Your Highness! This was the trades ledger from the bookstore that we were looking for.

673
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,660
Why is this here?

674
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,680
Wouldn't it be the young master who left it here?

675
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,450
Why do you always stick up for the young master every time something happens?

676
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,480
If it's not the young master, who would leave this ledger here? Answer me.

677
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,090
- Should I answer? 
 - Answer me.

678
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,710
That strange man whom Cha Dol mentioned could have left it here.

679
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,020
And to speak plainly, Ba Wu is enemies with this household,

680
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,690
would that house's young master be crazy to leave this here?

681
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,230
That's because of her—

682
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,590
Be quiet. You're grating on my nerves so much that I can't read it.

683
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,160
Move your head. Do you know what you're looking at?

684
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,060
- I don't know. 
- Get out.

685
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,600
But still—

686
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,740
In the spirit of participation,

687
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,990
Look here.

688
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,520
My lady's name is here.

689
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,430
My lady? Which lady?

690
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:51,470
The left state councillor's wife.

691
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:53,390
Mother-in-law?

692
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,300
Look at these people. They put on a good show.

693
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,650
It's enough. We can save Cha Dol's father with this ledger.

694
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,270
You plan to go somewhere?

695
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,570
I have to return to Hanyang.

696
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,900
Again?

697
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,780
Have him do it.

698
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,900
It's something he cannot do. I must go.

699
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,160
B-but Your Highness...

700
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,340
Wouldn't it be Kim Je Nam's grandson?

701
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,000
It couldn't be him.

702
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,560
He didn't go near where his mother and sister were staying.

703
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,160
If it were him he would have no reason to search through Hyeong-nim's room.

704
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,890
Then was it just a thief?

705
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:41,120
I wonder if it might be Kim Ja Jeom?

706
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,390
Kim Ja Jeom?

707
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:48,060
Yes. Hyeong-nim was the one who questioned the criminals, so he may wonder if there is any other evidence.

708
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,580
So couldn't he have sent someone?

709
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:54,760
It's definitely Kim Ja Jeom, who deserves to be gnawed on, Father!

710
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,490
Who is it?

711
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,020
How did Your Highness—?

712
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,800
I came because I have something to give you.

713
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,730
It's yet another ledger regarding the banned book.

714
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,360
You will know by looking at it.

715
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,320
It not only contains the name of the left state councillor's wife, but also the names of quite a few Great Northerners.

716
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,970
If you use this ledger, the Westerners might have a way out of danger, and rather the left state councillor...

717
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,590
and the left police chief could be pushed into a difficult situation.

718
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,000
I have a request in exchange.

719
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:05,630
You want me to use this ledger to make the left state councillor yield.

720
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:11,230
And you want me to restore the ranks of those who were ousted along with Grand Prince Yeongchang?

721
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

722
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,800
Forget it.

723
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,900
Is there even one thing that's turned out well from a plan he's devised?

724
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,310
Give him one last chance.

725
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,770
If you want the chance you should bring me a proper plan.

726
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:30,520
Is there even one person who survived that incident with Grand Prince Yeongchang?

727
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,150
Jeong Hyeop is dead. And I've already pardoned Han Jun Gyeom and Sin Heum.

728
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:39,920
Park Dong Ryang slandered Queen Inmok, so since the Westerners hate him, he's useless to us.

729
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,220
On top of that, the most important person was Kim Je Nam, the father of Queen Inmok.

730
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:48,030
Is there anyone surviving from Kim Je Nam's household? Speak!

731
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:51,780
All of the men are dead. Only his daughter-in-law and granddaughter live.

732
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,470
What use is it to restore their ranks?

733
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,760
Leave me.

734
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,540
Your Majesty, I would like report to you...

735
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,580
that Kim Je Nam's eldest grandson is alive.

736
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,350
What are you talking about?

737
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,980
His eldest grandson escaped and is alive. I saw him not long ago.

738
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,850
You saw him? Then do you know where he is right now?

739
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:30,340
The criminal held in the Royal Investigation Bureau is Kim Je Nam's grandson.

740
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,190
How do you know this?

741
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,250
No, more importantly... why are you telling us this only now ?

742
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,430
I'm worthy of death.

743
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,140
Leave me.

744
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,360
Are you hiding anything else from me?

745
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:06,400
If you deceive me one more time, I won't let it go then.

746
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,690
My lady, just a moment.

747
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,970
Are you crazy?

748
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:21,000
How could you hide the fact that  Princess Hwa In was alive?

749
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,260
I had no other choice at the time.

750
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,520
Forgive me.

751
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,740
Catch and confine the princess.

752
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,890
What?

753
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,970
Then what should we do?

754
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:38,030
Do you have the confidence to admit to deceiving the king at this point?

755
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:46,140
There's no other way except to make the lie into truth.

756
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:51,100
We can't ever let His Majesty know that the princess is alive.

757
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,210
If that happens, you, and I who recommended you,

758
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:58,440
we will both lose His Majesty's trust.

759
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,410
You can do it, right?

760
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:07,920
No, if you want to live, you must do it, no matter what.

761
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,520
Yes, my lady.

762
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,060
Ba Wu was Kim Je Nam's grandson.

763
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,050
Your Majesty, judging from Kim Ja Jeom's conduct...

764
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,950
there's a chance that the princess is also still alive.

765
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:39,720
Hwa In is alive?

766
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,960
You're saying Hwa In might be still alive.

767
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,030
I must open the interrogation court immediately.

768
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:14,190
His Majesty enters.

769
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,690
Bring out the criminal.

770
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

771
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,490
Bring out the criminal.

772
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:36,640
 That's right. I am the grandson of Kim Je Nam,

773
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,690
 Kim Dae Seok.

774
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:47,220

775
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,600
♫  They say this is how the world is  ♫

776

♫  But it's not only today that things don't go my way  ♫

777
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,780
Ba Wu was Kim Je Nam's grandson. 
♫  Like a rolling stone that rolls here and there on the ground  ♫

778
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:03,270
 Are you saying Hwa In might be still alive?

 Bossam - Steal the Fate

♫  Covered with wounds, I'm on my path again today  ♫

781
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,860
 I understand there is a second ledger.

782
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,740
 How do you think we should solve this problem?

783
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,760
 Why did Dae Yeop do such a thing?

784
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,810
 Do you think Dae Yeop knows the secret about himself?

785
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,590
 Aren't you intending to make me your sword?
