1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,480
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,540
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,120
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,940

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,080
 Bossam

6
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,410
Oh my, oh my, oh my word.

7
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,380
- What do we do? 
 - Cha Dol!

8
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,510
Cha Dol!

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,450
Ah, well... that is...

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,650
Who are you?

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,170
I'm Cha Dol's mother.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,620
And who are you?

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,740
Be careful what you say. She's the young madam of this household.

14
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,970
The young madam?

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,230
- What is it? 
 - I think the sound is coming from the yard.

16
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,420
 Episode 15

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,860
It is said even the cicada larva can crawl.

18
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,910
He's already remarried. That's more than I expected.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,050
But what am I supposed to do?  I don't have any intention to accept a concubine.

20
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,660
- Look here! 
 - Wenches who live off their looks like you,

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,920
I know them well, I know what is in their mind.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Why? Because I'm also a beautiful woman.

23
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,640
- Where do you— 
 - What's happening here?

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,890
Mother.

25
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,230
M-mother! I was too late in my greetings.

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,610
I am Cha Dol's mother.

27
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,030
Cha Dol's mother?

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,630
Sister-in-law, who is this crazy woman?

29
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,040
You must be Cha Dol's aunt!

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,410
Cha Dol's father is good-looking too, but you take after Mother and you're so beautiful.

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,980
It's like a bolt out of the blue!

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,320
What is this woman blathering about?

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,160
Are your lips stuck together? What is the meaning of this?

34
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,990
I'm sorry, Mother.

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,750
It seems as though she is Cha Dol's birth mother.

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,130
What? Birth mother?

37
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,160
Then Cha Dol isn't your child, but—

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,790
Are you all right, Mother?

39
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,180
Mother.

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,460
- You may faint at this rate. 
 - All of this ...

41
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,640
It is my fault for not coming to find you sooner.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,240
I will explain everything,

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,580
and will gladly accept any rebukes you have for me.

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,640
For now, try to calm yourself, and let's go inside.

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,980
You come in too.

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,710
You... did you know that Cha Dol had a birth mother?

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,290
Of course she knew.  She didn't give birth to him, so how could she not know?

48
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,590
You should be quiet for now.

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,550
Then... you schemed to deceive me until now?

50
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,070
- Because she didn't know even in her dreams that I would return‍— 
 - Shut your mouth.

51
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,930
Even without your help, this is giving me a splitting headache!

52
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,650
So what was the reason? Why did you deceive me?

53
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,960
Were you afraid that if you said you are neither Cha Dol's mother nor Dae Seok's first wife, I would not accept you?

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,710
Is that why you fiendishly planned this with Cha Dol's father and lied to me?

55
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,850
I have wronged you, Mother-in-law.

56
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,900
Surely, she didn't lie to us on purpose.

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,010
Imagine if she talked about a birth mother she knew nothing about.

58
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,310
It's obvious it would only hurt the poor innocent boy.

59
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,950
Isn't that right, Sister-in-law?

60
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,530
Cha Dol knows this too... that I am not his birth mother.

61
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,490
What?  Cha Dol knows?

62
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,360
Are you saying I am the only one who wasn't informed?

63
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,390
Forgive me.

64
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,890
Do you take me... or rather ... do you take my household for a joke?!

65
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,550
- Mom! 
 - Are you all right, Mother-in-law?

66
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,180
What are you doing? Hurry and bring her some water!

67
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,720
What? Cha Dol's birth mother? Why is that wench here?

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
After hearing about Dae Seok getting his title back, she must've made every effort to find his house.

69
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,260
-N-no, wait wait! 
 - Does this wench has a brass neck?

70
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,790
Please forgive me... Come here, you.

71
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,530
- Where do you think this is? Come here! 
 - Mother-in-law!

72
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,790
- Come here! 
 - How dare you barge in here like this?

73
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,420
Are you crazy? Are you?

74
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,020
The crazy person is this wench!

75
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,260
This wench is someone who abandoned her own son to run away in the middle of the night!

76
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,380
Mother-in-law, this is untrue.

77
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,890
It's not true. It's not true, Mother-in-law!

78
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,030
What's not true? I am the witness, I am!

79
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,490
When this wench abandoned Cha Dol in the middle of the night, I was the one who raised him on my back!

80
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,140
When Ba Wu grabbed the sickle yelling, "To hell with it all", I was the one to calm him down.

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,190
How could someone be so worthless?

82
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,960
Drag her away immediately!

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,020
No, please listen, Mother-in-law! Cha Dol's father was mistaken!

84
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,250
I can explain everything! It's a misunderstanding!

85
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,340
Wait! W-wait!

86
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,660
 Park Mun Seong

87
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,780
Whose badge is this?

88
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,510
This was my late father's badge.

89
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,670
Your father ... was a nobleman?

90
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,720
Yes.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,970
Hey, where did you find this? Where did you steal this from?!

92
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,070
You stay out of it.

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,480
What does it say? You can read it, right?

94
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,430
Park Mun Seong, born in 1590, passed civil service exam in 1612.

95
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,640
-The possessor of this badge passed the civil service exam ... does that mean you're truly a noblewoman? 
 - Yes.

96
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,880
What was a noblewoman doing with someone like my brother...?

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,760
Well, you see, Sister-in-law, compared to the other peasants, there was just something extraordinary about him.

98
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,050
I knew it at first sight, you see?

99
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,030
Even if he hung around peasants like him, there was just something different about his roots.

100
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,020
I couldn't place my finger on it at the time, but as soon as I saw you, I recognized it.

101
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,360
Just as I suspected,  he was a nobleman from an eminent family.

102
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,090
Why, you little ...!

103
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,860
Anyone can see she's a bloody liar. What's taking him so long to drag her out?

104
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,000
That's enough. Isn't she Cha Dol's birth mother?

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,360
Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law!

106
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,380
This here, these tears coming from her eyes are all fake!

107
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,740
Everything, from her head to toe, is a lie!

108
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,260
If I'm lying, show me some proof!

109
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,050
What evidence do I need when I've seen and listened to it firsthand?

110
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,890
Did you see me run away at night? You didn't!

111
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,620
You really must have lost your mind. Do you have a death wish?

112
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,830
- You sit too. 
 - Yes, Mother-in-law.

113
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,030
Mother-in-law, I'll meet with Cha Dol's father.

114
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,130
Please call him here for me, would you?

115
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,920
- Brother is— 
 - That's enough. You may leave now.

116
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,930
My lady. You must never accept this wench. This wench is—

117
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,590
- This is our family matter. It's not your concern. 
 - But ...

118
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,240
I told you to leave. Why are you still standing around?

119
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,110
So ... you just quietly stepped out?

120
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,210
Then what was I supposed to do? She was yelling at me to leave the room immediately.

121
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,420
But more importantly, that woman really is extraordinary.

122
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,900
That's what I want to say. I knew she was wanton and great at lying...

123
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,640
I never imagined she'd go this far.

124
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,900
Just how artfully she crafted her stories!

125
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,460
If I didn't know any better, she would've fooled me too!

126
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,820
She has her own past to worry about, do you think she'd barge in without a plan?

127
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,460
She probably made every preparation to fool the entire family.

128
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,000
Well she'll be caught for most of her lies once Ba Wu is back ...

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,760
but the problem is the identity badge!

130
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,190
- Identity badge?  
 - Yes, the identity badge!

131
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,550
Her ladyship was making a fuss about dragging her out immediately...

132
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,450
but as soon as she saw the badge, she instantly changed her tune.

133
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,450
Her ladyship loses control of herself over the noble class.

134
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,120
Does Cha Dol's father know that you're the daughter of a noble family?

135
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,830
No...

136
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,530
At the time, I wasn't in the situation to reveal that I'm a noblewoman.

137
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,400
This badge was the only keepsake from my father, so I couldn't bring myself to throw it away.

138
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,420
That's such a relief, isn't it?

139
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,820
If it weren't for this badge, you would've been kicked out immediately.

140
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,030
How could you be so cold? No matter what anyone says...

141
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm the mother of this house's firstborn.

142
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,120
and I'm Dae Seok's lawful wife. His first wife, I'm telling you.

143
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,400
Why does that matter? If it's true that you abandoned your husband and child in the middle of the night...

144
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,660
you have no right to live in the women's quarters here.

145
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,760
I told you that's wrong. Cha Dol's father was mistaken!

146
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,490
I don't want to hear it.

147
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,760
Both of you lied to me, so who am I to believe in?

148
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Right now I can't believe anyone.

149
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,430
So when Cha Dol's father returns, I will listen to him,

150
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,730
and I'll make my decision then.

151
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,290
So just understand that.

152
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,250
Yes, Mother-in-law. I will heed your words.

153
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,000
But Mother-in-law... where should I stay for the time being?

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,790
If you would assign me a room...

155
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,180
Must I decide that for you too?

156
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,500
Then... I will choose my own...

157
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,360
I don't want to see either of your faces. Both of you leave!

158
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,090
Leave this instant! Go!

159
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,700
What happened?

160
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,290
Please go inside.

161
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,960
I need to use that room.

162
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,590
Do you have a death wish?

163
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,610
I'm the first wife and you're the second.

164
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,880
Doesn't it make sense that I use that room?

165
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,500
What did you just say?

166
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,480
Am I being too polite?  Then, let's go again ...

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,930
Does it make sense for the likes of a mere concubine to use a room?

168
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,090
Empty that room this instant!

169
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,000
A mere concubine? This wench—

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,530
Please, Mother will hear.

171
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,800
Please clean a vacant room in the servants' quarters.

172
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,980
Shall I take a look around the room?

173
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,170
- Hey, stop right there!
 - Leave her be.

174
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,680
She's not the problem right now.

175
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,340
We don't know what kind of trouble my husband is in right now.

176
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,180
Perhaps his life is in danger.

177
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,130
- Why does it matter who uses what room? 
 - But still!

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Even so, if you let her use that room, you know your husband will be shocked.

179
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,320
That's a problem for later.

180
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,670
Right now, there's nothing more important that making sure my husband returns safely.

181
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,190
That's true, but there's nothing we can do right now.

182
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,300
Wait here a moment.

183
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,500
There's nothing for me to wear so I'll take some of your clothes.

184
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes, do as you please.

185
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,060
However, there are a few things I need right now, so I need to get them.

186
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,800
Could you please step aside for a moment?

187
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,210
I'll empty the room immediately. It shouldn't take long.

188
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,250
All right. Don't touch these.

189
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,310
Gosh, she's not human.

190
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,590
I can't believe that Cha Dol came out of that belly.

191
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,060
Your Highness.

192
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,190
Please convey this letter as soon as possible.

193
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,780
His life depends on it, so please hurry.

194
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,210
Mao Wenlong asked...

195
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,760
if you had any letter from the left state councillor to give him.

196
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,350
Do you have it?

197
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,920
If  the letter does not exist, he told me to tell you that you would be released with the understanding that

198
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,970
you agree to the condition of persuading the left state councillor to send military rations and funds.

199
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,290
If you agree, then you will be released,

200
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,090
but Joseon cannot avoid war.

201
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,670
Haven't you received any indication yet from court?

202
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,110
Perhaps it is preferable that there is no news.

203
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,110
Would the left state councillor be someone to lose such an opportunity?

204
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,910
I hope his majesty wakes up soon.

205
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,270
Your Majesty, I have received a letter from Mao Wenlong.

206
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,510
Please make a decision.

207
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,850
Your Majesty.

208
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,280
Is there really no other way?

209
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,560
If you really want to save Kim Dae Seok, there is only one way.

210
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,560
You must send food rations and a war chest, as Mao Wenlong wishes.

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,500
Will you feel better only if I let Kim Dae Seok die?

212
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,870
It is not I, but what the Ming general Mao Wenlong wants.

213
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,010
I am only urging you to do this for the sake of our Joseon's safety.

214
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,000
Please consider it.

215
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,990
Your Majesty, you called for me.

216
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,700
Come closer.

217
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,260
I heard that you sent Kim Ja Jeom to the north.

218
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,170
Why did you do that?

219
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,740
He's someone who lied to you.

220
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,610
It's a life-threatening place.

221
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,780
I sent him because I thought it would be a good place to test his loyalty.

222
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Did I make a mistake?

223
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,360
No, you did well.

224
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,040
However, I don't know what you intend to do about Kim Dae Seok.

225
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,660
Are you really going to abandon him?

226
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a waste, but what choice do I have?

227
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,660
If I want to appease Mao Wenlong, I have to give him a scapegoat.

228
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,990
If it really bothers you,

229
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,140
it would be better if you sent food.

230
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,520
Although we don't have enough food to send,

231
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,020
if we send food to Mao Wenlong

232
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,470
the Later Jin might misunderstand that we have allied ourselves with Ming and use it as a pretext for war.

233
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,430
We can't go to war against the Later Jin, can we?

234
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,990
I should send a letter to Mao Wenlong.

235
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,800
 (Mao Wenlong is sometimes blamed for the Manchu invasion of Korea in 1627.)

236
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,450
 This is a letter to Mao Wenlong.

237
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,280
  The contents say that we will provide food and  a war chest as he requested

238
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,590
 if General Mao kills Kim Dae Seok and makes it look as if he is missing.

239
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,560
 This is the last chance I'm giving you.

240
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,980
 What will you do?

241
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,940
 When you come back, you must return alone.

242
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,160
You have that on you, right?

243
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,470
The letter sent by your father to Mao Wenlong.

244
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,350
Telling him to kill me.

245
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,800
You should use that

246
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,330
to at least save your life.

247
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,580
It seems I'm going to die with or without that letter, anyway.

248
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
So don't you think you at least should live?

249
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,250
Do you mean that?

250
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,080
Of course I do.

251
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,120
Don't you want to live?

252
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
What crap are you spewing?

253
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,780
Of course, I want to live.

254
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,410
Who on earth wants to die?

255
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,190
Then why aren't you asking for your life?

256
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,360
I've lived not owning anything and have debts here and there.

257
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,040
So at least to you,

258
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,280
I don't ever want to be indebted.

259
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,790
 Dae Seok

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,820
I thought this was a rich household and all they have is scorched rice?

261
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,130
How could the heavens be so indifferent!

262
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,990
Wasn't the burden you've had to bear enough?

263
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,600
Your Highness is a royal child, preciously cherished by his majesty.

264
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,160
How could this happen to a cherished highness?

265
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,210
Please watch your mouth.

266
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,400
What will you do if someone hears?

267
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,560
The more  I think about it, the angrier I become.

268
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,340
Are you not done yet?

269
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,920
Can't you ask before entering the room?

270
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,510
How much do you have to pack that you're taking the whole day?

271
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,770
I need to lie down so,

272
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,650
- roughly pack up and get out. 
 - Your High—

273
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,120
Are you all right?

274
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,280
That little—

275
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
What?

276
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,590
Gosh.

277
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,530
It's the woodcutter we called. Come in.

278
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,370
- Leave it over there.
 - Yes sir.

279
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,370
Why are you personally preparing that crazy woman's meal?

280
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm back.

281
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,070
What happened? Did you deliver the letter?

282
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,060
Yes, I saw him leave in a hurry before coming back.

283
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,860
He said you shouldn't worry, that nothing will happen to Cha Dol's father.

284
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,740
Good work.

285
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,420
Where is that woman?

286
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,020
It's nice.

287
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,610
- There was a lot to carry today, too, right?
 - Yes.

288
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,680
Thank you for your work.

289
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,210
- Thank you.
 - Goodbye.

290
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm back from school.

291
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,090
Oh, good. Well, Cha Dol...

292
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,700
Where is Mother? Is she in the kitchen?

293
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,480
Well, that is...

294
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,340
Cha Dol.

295
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,190
Grandmother! I'm home.

296
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,000
Good.

297
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,120
I'm home.

298
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,970
Cha Dol!

299
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,090
Cha Dol.

300
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,470
My baby... He's grown up so much.

301
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,740
You are all grown up.

302
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,900
Cha Dol. You're grown up, my baby.

303
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,900
- my baby...
 - Cha Dol, she's your mother. Greet her.

304
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,680
Cha Dol.

305
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,640
This lunch table!

306
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,140
Where should I put it?

307
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Mother!

308
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,300
She's the mother who gave birth to you. Greet her.

309
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,310
Cha Dol. I'm your mom.

310
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,500
- T-That! 
 - Cha Dol! Where are you going?

311
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,250
Who do you think you are to act like his mother?

312
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,900
I gave birth to him. He's my baby.

313
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,860
I will take care of my baby,

314
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,000
so from now on stay away from my Cha Dol. Do you understand?

315
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,780
Prepare Cha Dol's meal, too. Bring both to my room.

316
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,660
Cha Dol.

317
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,960
Are you sure you're not going to eat?

318
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,270
Cha Dol.

319
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,430
Of course, you won't remember mom's face,

320
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,620
but still, I'm your mom.

321
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,670
A real mom who gave birth to you.

322
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,600
That woman before...

323
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,470
Never mind. Forget it.

324
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,280
Well, time flows after all.

325
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,290
We will be living in the same house forever.

326
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,190
Let's take it a little at a time. Go on and read.

327
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,900
Where are you going?

328
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,380
I have something to ask Mother.

329
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,920
I always study with Mother

330
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,190
the part that will be covered the next day at school.

331
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,180
Mother, Mother, Mother!

332
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,100
That really gets on my nerves.

333
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,100
When your mom, whom you thought was dead, has returned, aren't you happy?

334
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,010
You were not dead.

335
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,420
You cheated on Father with his friend and fled overnight.

336
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,370
Just read that book!

337
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,780
What did I say? I said we should've told them everything in the first place.

338
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,040
I thought they would kick us out!

339
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,790
When even our king knows, how would they possibly kick us out?

340
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,770
Oh, dear. You make me frustrated.

341
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,110
If we tell them she's the princess,

342
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,480
we would have to tell them why she's staying in this household.

343
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Do you think they'll readily welcome us, knowing everything?

344
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,920
When their entire family could get into trouble?

345
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,090
No way, well ... Still, they wouldn't have kicked her out, right?

346
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,500
Honestly, that left state councillor is our lady's enemy.

347
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,180
Our princess is his daughter-in-law.

348
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,310
Well, technically, she's his ex-daughter-in-law, but—

349
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,350
I was hoping life would be a bit easier on her here, but

350
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,500
but that wench has appeared out of nowhere!

351
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,340
Our princess is so unlucky.

352
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,520
Her ex-mother-in-law gave her a hard time, saying that her bad luck killed her husband*, 
 (Wives were blamed for husband's untimely death in that era)

353
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,310
and this mother-in-law is— But she isn't. She isn't even her mother-in-law.

354
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,160
She looks down upon her, saying she's a peasant.

355
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,280
Now, she's being treated as a concubine!

356
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,250
What can we do? What's done is done.

357
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,570
There's nothing we can do but wait for Ba Wu.

358
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,980
It's so absurd and frustrating that I could die!

359
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,200
In any case, I wonder how Cha Dol is doing.

360
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,970
Mother. Mother—

361
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,370
Where is Mother?

362
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,080
Your mother is right here.

363
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,210
Here.

364
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,770
Let's go.

365
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,640
Hurry. Go.

366
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,640
 I will never die leaving you all alone.

367
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,580
What's wrong? You can't fall asleep?

368
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,640
♫ Sleep, sleep, my baby. ♫

369
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,490
I'm not a baby though.

370
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,060
Just sleep.

371
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:02,030
♫ Sleep, sleep, my baby. ♫

372
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,800
Mother.

373
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,240
Why aren't you sleeping?

374
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,550
She's snoring too loudly. I can't fall asleep.

375
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,950
Her snore is ten times louder than Father's.

376
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,410
Can I... stay here for a while?

377
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,150
Of course, you can. Let's sit.

378
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,420
Mother... the one in that room, you know.

379
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,130
Since she's my mother,

380
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,980
since I'm her son,

381
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,860
I know that I should listen to her and behave well, but...

382
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,720
But?

383
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,330
But I don't feel as if she's my mother.

384
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,770
It feels as if she's a stranger. It's weird.

385
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm a little bit scared.

386
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,890
It could be that since you two were separated when you were a baby,

387
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,800
it feels like that because you don't have many memories of her.

388
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,350
Today is only the first day,

389
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,220
- so when time passes, then—
 - But you were different.

390
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,830
It didn't feel weird, right from the first day we met.

391
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,130
It just felt nice.

392
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,400
It's a secret.  Keep it to yourself, Mother.

393
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,960
What is it?

394
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,980
It seems that the mother in that room doesn't like me, either.

395
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,060
There is no mother who doesn't like her child.

396
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,870
You shouldn't think like that.

397
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,170
Your mother will be really sad if she finds out.

398
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,120
I will keep your secret,

399
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,110
so promise me that you will never think that way, ever.

400
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,160
Go on.

401
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,740
I promise.

402
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,270
How can she put on an act and cry like that?

403
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,990
That's a skill, too. Others might fall for it.

404
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,160
But there could've been a bit of truth, too.

405
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,910
She gave him birth, after all. She last saw her child when he was a baby, you know.

406
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,320
Wake up! She's so fake down to her core, that woman!

407
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,480
But still, Cha Dol is her only son.

408
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,460
When she was with Ba Wu, every word which emerged from her mouth was a lie.

409
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,290
Ten days after she gave birth to Cha Dol, she would go out at night.

410
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,380
No way.

411
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,500
Her baby would be so hungry and cry all night long,

412
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,820
but that so-called mother would come home at dawn.

413
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,080
What was that? She'd say she was working at a feast site,

414
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,220
that she went in order to help neighbors and what not. She would keep lying.

415
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,990
She would go straight to sleep without feeding her child, saying she was dead tired.

416
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,890
Oh, heavens!

417
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,060
It was that bad. When I heard she fled overnight, I said

418
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,220
"It turned out well, Ba Wu. It's better to marry another woman."

419
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,730
I even said that to him.

420
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,920
Well, from what I see, she hasn't changed at all.

421
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,850
Why did he get married to such a woman then?

422
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:52,040
That woman had an evil plan. She got Ba Wu drunk and ...

423
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,390
That naive idiot, Ba Wu...

424
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,240
And she's still called a mother. I feel so sorry for Cha Dol.

425
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,260
I feel more sorry for Ba Wu!

426
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,530
How will he get rid of her?

427
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,090
Kick her out or whatnot. Only Cha Dol's father can do it.

428
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,590
When will he come back?

429
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,630
Please have some rice.

430
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,980
Have some rice.

431
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,330
 - Help me! 
 - Mother!

432
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,890
 Buddhist holy symbol

433
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,770
What is this?

434
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,140
Give it to me. Give it to me.

435
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,460
Hurry up! Quickly!

436
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,540
Let's go.

437
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,700
Sir Monk, I handed it to him.

438
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,830
You did a good job.

439
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,320
It's an emergency!

440
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,260
What's wrong?

441
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,720
A messenger came from Hanyang.

442
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,130
His Majesty agreed to hand you over to Mao Wenlong.

443
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,900
Mao Wenlong will try to kill you. Please take care of yourself.

444
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,630
I will try to find a solution as soon as possible.

445
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,410
I'm going to escape from here. What are you going to do?

446
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,020
Are you going to come with me?

447
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,090
Halt.

448
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,760
What are you two doing here?
 (in Chinese)

449
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,830
Which unit do you belong to?

450
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,060
Get them!

451
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,360
- Sir Monk.
- Sir Monk!

452
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,970
What are you doing here?

453
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,850
The princess asked me for this favor.

454
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,010
I will tell you in detail later. Hide yourselves for now.

455
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,320
It's dangerous around here. Go to Uiju.

456
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
Then, what about you?

457
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,910
Don't worry about me. Just go. Hurry!

458
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,370
Let's go.

459
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,420
Dear blessed Buddha, please look upon them.

460
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,150
Namo Amitabha*...
 (Buddhist chant)

461
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:28,100
You idiot. Why are you desperately defying your father?

462
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,610
There was a silk road to success.

463
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,750
Is this because of your damn feelings?

464
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,560
I just do what my heart tells me to do.

465
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,480
Don't mind me. Just think of ways to stay alive.

466
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,710
It's the same with you, no? When you could live quietly and enjoy life,

467
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,640
why are you risking your life?

468
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm not risking my life.

469
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,820
I'm going to go back home alive no matter what.

470
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,720
I have something to protect. Someone who's more precious than my life.

471
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,450
Death? That can come later.

472
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,900
Are you all right?

473
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,220
Please don't kill me!

474
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,400
Whose order is this?

475
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,330
It was his excellency the left state councillor's order.

476
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,100
I won't appear before you ever again, so please spare me.

477
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,410
I don't know if you've heard, but Kim Dae Seok has escaped.

478
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,620
He is so talented.

479
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,270
I don't even know how he managed to escape.

480
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,140
He's a criminal who defied your orders.

481
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,430
You must capture him quickly and turn him over to Mao Wenlong.

482
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,540
I should do that...

483
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,920
But, you know...

484
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,930
I heard your son escaped along with him.

485
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm overwhelmed, Your Majesty.

486
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,450
Since they escaped together, both of them should be punished.

487
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,250
I can't spare only your son either. It's quite a predicament.

488
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,680
Officers Kim Dae Seok and Yi Dae Yeop abdicated their duties

489
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,450
and botched a serious matter for our country by letting their personal emotions get the best of them.

490
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,720
It is right for you to give them severe punishment.

491
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,980
Please give severe punishment to my son, Yi Dae Yeop,  as well, Your Majesty.

492
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,830
You are indeed the left state councillor.

493
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,990
But I am afraid that the Westerners won't recognize your loyalty.

494
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,410
Because you recommended them as two special military officers,

495
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,990
the Westerners might say that you should also take responsibility along with them.

496
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,040
That's what I'm worried about.

497
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,620
It's been a while since I asked you to determine what the king hid in that house.

498
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,110
You haven't said a word yet.

499
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,990
I am sorry.

500
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,460
Royal guards guard the front gate to the house and prevent anyone from entering.

501
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,410
Kim Dae Seok doesn't accept any servants except a man called Chun Bae.

502
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,380
Chun Bae?

503
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,710
He's the man who bossamed the princess with Kim Dae Seok.

504
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,250
We kept him in our storeroom.  Do you mean the churl who ran away with Court Lady Jo?

505
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,020
Yes, that's right.

506
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,090
But that man is like a real brother to Kim Dae Seok.

507
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,730
Why do you think you need a person who lives there in order to extract information?

508
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,380
What?

509
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,360
Your Excellency, it's Tae Cheol.

510
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,350
Enter.

511
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,690
I heard that it seems there is another woman in the women's quarters, who is not Kim Dae Seok's sister.

512
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,430
- Another woman? 
 - Yes. I have bribed  a woodcutter who frequents the house regularly.

513
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,580
- There was a lot to carry today, too, right?
 - Yes.

514
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,860
 - Good job. 
 - Thank you.

515
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,610
 -  I'm back from school. 
 - Ah, yes.

516
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,420
 Where's Mother?  Is she in the kitchen?

517
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,250
 Cha Dol.

518
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,760
 - Grandmother! I'm home. 
 - Good.

519
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,790
 Good boy.

520
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,250
He heard Kim Dae Seok's son looking for his mother.

521
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,110
Is that so?

522
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,480
It means Kim Dae Seok has a wife.

523
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,490
Didn't you say that Kim Dae Seok is a single father with one child?

524
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,120
Yes, that was what I thought as well.

525
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,860
But based on the woodcutter's words,

526
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,210
it's clear that she is living in that home, although he didn't see it for himself.

527
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,480
- Find out who that woman is immediately. 
 - Yes, Your Excellency.

528
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,580
I'm only asking you to ask them if they need anything.

529
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,260
Why would you not agree to even that?

530
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,890
Madam! I am a peddler.

531
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,910
I have so many rings and ornaments. Please take a look.

532
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,340
Come in, let me look at your wares.

533
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,030
We cannot allow that.

534
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,980
She is someone I know.

535
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,640
I've been her customer for over ten years, so I will vouch for her identity.

536
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,150
That's good enough, isn't it?

537
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,180
This way.

538
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,590
Are you crazy? How can you carelessly let others enter?

539
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,370
I have some things that I need.

540
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,990
- She's just a peddler.
 - No way!

541
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,740
Get out please.

542
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,380
What do you think you're doing?

543
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,990
- Who are you to tell her to leave? 
 - 'You... ?'

544
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,810
I am the young madam of this home. I am the lady of the house, got it?

545
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,790
Didn't you see the guards surrounding this home outside?

546
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,820
It's because you can't let just anyone inside.

547
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,650
- Get out! Get out! 
 - Why are you doing this?

548
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
-  What is going on? 
 - No!

549
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,460
What is going on?

550
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,480
Mother.

551
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,060
Why all the fuss?

552
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,430
Mother, a peddler came.

553
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,180
I asked her in to show you, Mother.

554
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,350
And this man is having fits trying to throw her out for no reason.

555
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,620
Peddler?

556
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,630
Yes. She says she has all kinds of things.

557
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,060
Hello, Madam.

558
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,080
I've been supplying this area for ten years.

559
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,280
And I heard that you just moved in, so I am paying you a visit.

560
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,560
Well, I never bother to look at cheap stuff.

561
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,000
She said she also has plenty of precious items, Mother.

562
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,650
Bring her in.

563
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,940
Yes, Mother.

564
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,760
Don't!

565
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,900
Where is she?

566
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:25,180
Because it was noisy here... Over there...

567
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,650
Please stay inside until the peddler leaves.

568
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,430
Goodness.

569
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,350
Let's see. Is this face powder?

570
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,900
- Yes, Madam. 
 - So pretty.

571
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,080
It's rouge. Mother, I want this one.

572
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,060
Are these the only rings you have?

573
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,730
Of course not.

574
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,410
Of course not. It seems you like rings, Young Madam.

575
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,690
I wonder if there is anyone else in this home?

576
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,410
Who else would there be?

577
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,690
I just mean that if there was another madam or miss in this house

578
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,840
I was just hoping to sell more things, that is all.

579
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,830
No, there aren't.

580
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,580
That woman in the yard from before, she's a servant.

581
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,880
Yes, a servant.

582
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,570
Ah, yes.

583
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,290
So pretty.

584
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,830
- Very pretty.  
 - Please look some more.

585
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,620
She was Kim Dae Seok's wife, indeed.

586
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:54,520
A wife who wasn't there before suddenly appeared?

587
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,570
According to the peddler, it appears that they parted a long time ago, and reunited recently.

588
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,730
Did they get back together because his identity was reinstated and he now has a house?

589
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:10,860
But there is no way that his wife is what the king is hiding in that house.

590
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,750
Instruct that peddler to find out more details

591
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,410
about everyone who lives in that house.

592
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,370
Yes, my Lord.

593
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,490
You should eat with me.

594
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:36,320
I can eat later with Chun Bae, so please hurry and eat.

595
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,050
But it's so bothersome.

596
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,390
We share a room, why can't we eat together?

597
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,020
Please don't say that, it upsets me.

598
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,480
Hurry and eat, please.

599
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:01,390
We can't know who might barge in here next. Aiyoo.

600
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,680
That cunning firefox of a woman...

601
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,920
There you go again. It's true that she is Cha Dol's mother.

602
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,960
Watch your words.

603
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,970
I know that.

604
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,830
But every little thing she does is so hateful.

605
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,420
Come out.

606
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,490
Why? What now?

607
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,720
Not you.  That one.

608
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,990
How dare she? Does she think she's talking to her servant?

609
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,220
Your Highness...

610
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,410
What's with these bowls?

611
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,400
- Polish them all by the end of the day. 
 - Yes.

612
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,150
You know how to polish brass bowls, don't you?

613
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:02,800
Scrub them hard with straw until they are shiny and glossy.

614
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,030
Yes, I will polish them well.

615
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:13,110
We have honey rice puffs and sweet rice drink, don't we?

616
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,590
- Bring in some snacks to the main room. 
 - Yes, I understand.

617
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,820
Right away.

618
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,530
You...

619
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:30,670
What?  How dare you glower at me?

620
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,020
I am the mistress and you are the servant.

621
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,350
Do you want to get kicked out?

622
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,660
Allow me to apologize on her behalf. Please calm down.

623
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,790
Why are you so protective of her?

624
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:49,900
One would think you're a noble lady looking out for her maid.

625
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,150
No, more like her nanny?

626
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,990
I will bring you the rice puffs and sweet rice drink.

627
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:08,210
I am suddenly craving cookies. Do you know how to make them?

628
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,720
Why? What?

629
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,920
Nothing.  Nothing at all.

630
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,930
That thing ... I ought to ...

631
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,690
What's with her?

632
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,230
Please go inside and eat.

633
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,380
The soup must be cold already.

634
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,660
Ugh, that...

635
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,790
Won't someone bossam that thing?

636
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,930
Bossam? Should I do it?

637
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,380
Should I do it and throw her outside the city?

638
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,350
Yes, if you would, I would be grateful.

639
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,620
No, outside the city is too safe.

640
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,960
How about just throw her in the river?

641
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,540
I feel refreshed just hearing you say that.

642
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,920
I want to scratch her face so it's shiny and glossy.

643
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,450
What?

644
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,890
Your skin looks beautiful today.

645
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,350
Isn't it too pale for her?

646
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,390
What do you mean? She looks flawless like white jade and so beautiful.

647
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,730
It applies so smoothly because you have flawless pale skin, Mother-in-law.

648
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,860
Yes, I have been told I have beautiful light skin since I was young.

649
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,090
I can totally tell.

650
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,210
You have perfect facial features, too.

651
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,920
If I were as half beautiful as you, I would've been told I was a beauty.

652
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,720
That's good. You can stop.

653
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,270
Wait a minute. We need to apply yeonji ( rouge ), too.

654
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,540
I told you, that's enough.

655
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,210
It won't take long.

656
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,060
Oh, dear. I didn't get what people meant by "lips like cherries".

657
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,500
You got those lips like cherries!

658
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,030
Wait a second.

659
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,700
I didn't get what people meant by "sweet talk", I guess this is it.

660
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,190
What's wrong with a daughter-in-law sweet-talking to her mother-in-law?

661
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,430
It just means that the daughter-in-law does a good job to the mother-in-law's liking.

662
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:42,080
I wonder whether you have a good character or a strong stomach.

663
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,210
I've brought some snacks.

664
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,630
Snacks?

665
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,930
I thought you'd be a bit hungry by now, so I ordered her to bring some.

666
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,010
Bring it in.

667
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,220
You did a good job. You can leave now.

668
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,510
You should have some with us, Sister-in-law.

669
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,100
Sister-in-law, you're too much.

670
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,830
What did I do?

671
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,350
I'm not such a tolerant woman, truth be told.

672
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:28,040
She's a concubine who flirted with my husband and lured my child.

673
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,950
How could I have snacks with that wench?

674
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,520
Don't you agree, Mother-in-law?

675
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,710
You did a good job. You can go and rest now.

676
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,400
Yes, Mother.

677
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,450
Didn't I tell you that I'm going to make a decision when Cha Dol's father arrives?

678
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,960
You should behave moderately until then.

679
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,070
Yes, Mother-in-law. I'll keep it in mind.

680
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,340
"Yes, Mother-in-law. Yes, Mother-in-law."

681
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,390
She's good at replying.

682
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,920
Sister-in-law.

683
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,500
This... I picked it earlier for you. I thought it would look good on you.

684
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,310
Try it on.

685
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,740
I don't think you bought this for me.

686
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,990
I can ask Cha Dol's dad to buy me one later. Try it on.

687
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,930
Come to think of it, you haven't asked about Cha Dol's father.

688
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:40,390
He hasn't been home for a couple of days. You're not curious about his whereabouts?

689
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,880
I heard that he went to the North on the king's order.

690
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,520
How did you know? Did you tell her?

691
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,850
No, I didn't.

692
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:55,440
I... heard... from the guards at the front gate.

693
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,400
Really?

694
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,480
I have never seen them talk.

695
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,450
That's why I prayed last night.

696
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,380
So he can come home healthy and well.

697
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,610
If that's true, I guess my brother is fortunate with his wives.

698
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,880
Life away from one's home is not easy.

699
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,990
I wonder whether he's healthy and eating well..

700
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:31,670
I, too, cannot even swallow a sip of water when I think of Cha Dol's father.

701
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,530
Why don't you swallow that first?

702
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,150
Well, this must be it.

703
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,850
Is that you can swallow everything but water?

704
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,050
Be quiet! Is it time to joke around?

705
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,780
You're not worried about your brother?

706
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,790
Yi Dae Yeop. Yi Dae Yeop!

707
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,000
Who are you all? Why did you bring us here?

708
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,990
While monitoring Mao Wenlong, we found you two.

709
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:49,560
We brought you here because you seemed useful. Who are you?

710
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,220
We are temporarily appointed military officers from Joseon.

711
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,120
Temporarily appointed military officers?

712
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,220
We could not find any evidence that you are that.

713
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,590
It's true though. We don't have any proof, but we really are military officers.

714
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:04,950
He had a secret note for Mao Wenlong.

715
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,160
How dare you lie?

716
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,880
That is...

717
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,900
If you don't speak the truth,
  (Speaking Jurchen language)

718
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,300
you will die a terrible death.

719
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,370
You can swallow that right now?

720
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:44,250
I've starved myself all day thinking of Cha Dol's dad. I got dizzy.

721
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,330
Would you like to have one?

722
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,250
Never mind. Forget it.

723
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,120
Talking further will just tire out my mouth...

724
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,860
I shall kick that girl out soon.

725
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:03,150
It will give me a headache when Ba Wu returns.

726
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,030
Hey, Yi Dae Yeop.

727
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,810
Hey! Wake up.

728
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,590
Yi Dae Yeop!

729
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,580
Are you all right?

730
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:10,290
What happened?

731
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,590
We got caught again.

732
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,780
But that's not the problem here.

733
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:18,780
These people took the secret note you had.

734
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,970
As things stand, we both will die.

735
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:27,530
So you must not open your mouth about your father, all right?

736
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:34,680
You can use me and get out of here.

737
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,520
Think straight.

738
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:52,090

739
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:57,190
♫  it's brushing by  ♫

740
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:04,670
♫  Although briefly, it is pausing  ♫

741
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:09,740
♫  Although the fingertips which grasp my collar  ♫

 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

743
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,560
 This man has nothing to do with Mao Wenlong. You can kill me and let this man go.

744
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,560
 That man outside will die.

745
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,060
 No, we have to prevent this.

746
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,630
 If you don't keep the promise, it might bring greater trouble.

747
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,210
 I'm not the one that's going to keep the promise. The left state councillor is.

748
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,260
 I can swear to the heavens, I never—

749
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,990
 You say you didn't do it, but here is the proof.

750
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,630
 I guess you really have a death wish, don't you?

751
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,790
 You even went along with him when he bring shame on me. What is your reason?

752
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:41,020
 It's because the king is right and you're wrong.

753
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,000
 I sincerely love her with all my heart.

754
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,710
 No! I can't leave!

755
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:46,870
 I'm going to tell them everything!

756
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:50,060
 That woman is... the princess.

757
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,400
♫  The hand which held me  ♫
