1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,460
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,600
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,060
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,010

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,080
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,320
 Do you love the throne that much?

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,490
 Is that position the only thing you value, so that's the only thing you can see?

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,430
 Will you retain that position even if you have to sell your daughter?

9
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,760
 Hwa In ...

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,880
  has been killed by Your Majesty.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,980
 Your Majesty is no longer a husband nor a father.

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,660
What's going on here?

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,030
It is a gesture of allegiance from me toward Your Highness.

14
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,360
Isn't this the princess you've always wanted?

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,410
Now you are free to embrace her as you like.

16
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,600
Won't you shut this dirty mouth of yours!

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,880
I'd rather die than being played by your dirty trick.

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,150
You've become quite ill-mannered in your speech, after spending so long with those lowly people.

19
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,360
They are not the lowly ones.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,880
What is lowly is your dirty greed and your nature devoid of morals.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,340
If you run this mouth of yours one more time,

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,330
I will ask the King to hand over her Highness the Royal Consort as well.

23
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,590
Would you like that?

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,320
How can you do this and call yourself a nobleman?

25
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,420
Take her away.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,040
Let me escort you out.

27
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,350
Did you threaten his majesty the king to take away the princess?

28
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,080
Your Highness was not listening to me,

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,190
thus leaving me with no other choice.

30
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,600
Your Highness is mistaken,

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,010
if you think you have stopped the rebellion just by getting rid of a weapon depot.

32
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,120
Becoming the king of Joseon is your destiny

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,470
and you cannot avoid it, so do not reject it, Your Highness.

34
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,720
Keep a good eye on her, so that she cannot try anything.

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,250
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,910
Let's go.

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,860
The young master will certainly save you, so trust him and be patient.

38
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,140
I am here to convey the young master's words.

39
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,170
Tell me again what you have said.

40
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,230
I request Your Highness's help in driving away the current king, Yi I Cheom and the greater Northern faction.

41
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,490
Do not tell me you are preparing a coup?

42
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,570
We are.

43
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,460
Your Highness, if anything goes wrong and Gwanghae and Yi I Cheom learn about itâ€”

44
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,590
I will ensure no harm befalls either of you, so please put your faith in me.

45
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,350
What can I do to help you?

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,460
It's a letter that authorizes the rebellion, written by the Queen Dowager herself.

47
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,770
This letter not only will convince the general of capital defense Lord Yi Hong Rip,

48
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,060
it will also provide us with a means to get the Southern faction involved as well.

49
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,850
I have a condition.

50
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,660
- Tell me. 
 - Please assure me you will protect the lives

51
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,790
of Her Highness  Royal Consort Yun, Princess Hwa In, and his majesty as well.

52
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,860
I will ask His Excellency Prince Neungyang.

53
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,180
Give me a definite answer.

54
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,940
All right. I will do everything in my power to persuade His Excellency Prince Neungyang.

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,930
Thank you.

56
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,970
- When will the rebellion take place? 
 - On the last day of this month.

57
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,260
No. It is too late.

58
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,530
The left state councillor is planning a revolt for the middle of this month on the day of the full moon.

59
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,120
- Full moon?
 - Yes.

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,220
Thus we need to plan the rebellion for before the middle of the month.

61
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,550
Are you telling me to leave Joseon?

62
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,150
Yes. I will be following you shortly, thus please depart first.

63
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,790
Come with me. I cannot leave by myself.

64
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,250
There is something I need to do.

65
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,590
- I will follow after you as soon as that is over. 
 - Dae Yeop...

66
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,690
No matter what happens, I will follow after you, stay with you,

67
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,390
and protect you, Mother.

68
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,330
Please, give me an opportunity to redeem myself

69
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,660
for the days I have been unfilial to you, Mother.

70
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Thank you, Mother.

71
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,750
In exchange, you must promise me one thing.

72
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,120
That you will not die, no matter what.

73
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,830
That no matter what happens, you will come back to me alive.

74
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,950
Yes, Mother.

75
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,490
 I have lived all my life in deep sorrow from not having followed that person at that time.

76
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,830
 I know  better than anyone how you are feeling right now.

77
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,290
 How could I stop you?

78
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,470
I will follow your will, Uncle.

79
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,220
Do you mean it?

80
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,260
I do.

81
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,370
In exchange, bring me and the princess

82
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,060
to pay my respect to the tomb of my father prince Imhae.

83
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,890
All right. I will prepare for the trip to the royal tomb.

84
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,830
Thank you.

85
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,310
Father. I am certain he is planning something. Why did you agree to it?

86
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,200
- I did it so he can try something. 
 - Pardon me?

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,220
It is certain that Kim Dae Seok will appear and attempt to save the princess.

88
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,070
Prepare to capture him.

89
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,400
I believe Won Yeop is following behind without any problem?

90
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,030
Do not worry. I have sent people earlier and verified all is well.

91
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,020
I am sure it was here. Where in the world is he?

92
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,670
- I could not find them. 
 - What happened?

93
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,560
I have looked everywhere,

94
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,790
but I could not find any trace of his excellency's party.

95
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,330
I think there must have been an accident.

96
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,830
This cannot be...

97
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,660
Don't tell me that Tae Cheol, this rascal...

98
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,270
Stop here!

99
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,300
Your Highness.

100
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,160
What is it?

101
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,060
It seems she needs to relieve herself before we continue.

102
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,890
Did you not leave a pot inside?

103
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,800
I did.

104
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,890
She says it needs to be emptied.

105
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,390
There happens to be a spring here.

106
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,200
Let us take the opportunity to rest while replenishing our water.

107
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,830
We will take a short rest. Keep thorough guard around.

108
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,710
Yes!

109
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,060
Your Excellency. Please step down to rest comfortably.

110
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,000
All right.

111
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,830
Catch Yi I Cheom!

112
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,970
Protect His Excellency!

113
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,300
I am all right, so stop them!

114
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,970
Yes!

115
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,790
Do not feel concerned, as I will guard the princess.

116
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,610
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

117
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,790
Hyeong-nim!

118
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,140
Hyeong-nim.

119
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,040
Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim.

120
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,200
- Go after them! 
 - Yes!

121
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,010
Tae Cheol, you rascal!

122
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,900
- My husband. 
 - Are you all right?

123
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,430
I am relieved you are uninjured.

124
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,930
Hyeong-nim!

125
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,790
Oh? What is this?

126
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,680
Really, you made sure you'd survive!

127
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,900
It hurt!

128
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,570
I will go with her. You follow His Lordship.

129
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,510
- Let us go. 
 - You go first.

130
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,600
There is something for me to finish.

131
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,250
Finish what? You'll be caught!

132
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,850
Do you have to do it now?

133
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,800
Now is the only time I can do it.

134
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,130
I will come with you.

135
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,980
Don't you have something to do?

136
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,950
My uncle will go straight home and try to confine my mother.

137
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,120
My mother is the priority. I will follow shortly, so leave at once.

138
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,690
This is not the time for this. We need to leave now.

139
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,150
Yes.

140
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,080
I don't know what is the matter, but be careful.

141
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,510
I will.

142
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,730
All right, then let us go.

143
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,990
I see you have decided to leave far away with Aunt.

144
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,720
Yes.

145
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
I have always been on the receiving end of your kindness,

146
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,740
and never had an opportunity to return the favor.

147
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,020
I can only feel sorry to see you leaving in this manner.

148
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,060
Do not say so.

149
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,520
I made things difficult for you because of my futile lingering feelings.

150
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,670
I can only apologize for it.

151
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,960
I will pray you live a healthy and comfortable life, wherever you are.

152
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,800
Thank you.

153
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,850
I will also hope you stay well in the future, Your Highness.

154
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,960
Run away if you want to live.

155
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,200
What is the meaning of this?

156
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,660
The chaos and crippled state Joseon is in right now,

157
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,580
you cannot deny that all of it is because of you.

158
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,580
So, as long as I'm gone, everything will be in peace?

159
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,740
Yes. That is correct.

160
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,630
Have you decided to forget your father's enemy

161
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,440
and swear loyalty to the king because of a mere girl?

162
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:54,180
My father's enemy is you.

163
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,190
Dae Yeop.

164
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,710
Don't say my name.

165
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,990
You don't even have the right to do that.

166
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,710
I will kill you

167
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,450
and avenge my father and appease my mother's grudge.

168
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,510
My name,

169
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,970
family, and bloodline,

170
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,890
I will abandon everything you have given me.

171
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,560
So please do the same.

172
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,230
Forget things like treason and live in hiding.

173
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,380
If you don't do that, I will never forgive you.

174
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,970
You brought this upon yourself!

175
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,740
Don't blame me for it!

176
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,730
Father.

177
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,740
Even just once,

178
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,540
even just once,

179
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,460
did you ever think of me

180
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,650
as your own child?

181
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,680
Answer me before you go!

182
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,280
Father!

183
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,420
What's wrong?

184
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,880
I think I'll have to go to the young master.

185
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,510
Yes. I also feel strangely anxious.

186
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,180
I do too. Please wait here for a while.

187
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,210
No. I will go with you.

188
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,530
Didn't we promise to be together in life or in death?

189
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,150
Yi Dae Yeop! Yi Dae Yeop!

190
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,440
Young Master!

191
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,540
Yi Dae Yeop!

192
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,280
Young Master!

193
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,030
Yi Dae Yeop!

194
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,710
Yi Dae Yeop!

195
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,650
Why did you come back?

196
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,600
Who did this to you?

197
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
Was it your uncle?

198
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,430
To save the princess,

199
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,750
I tried to kill him.

200
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,370
But...

201
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:00,020
I couldn't bring myself to use the sword.

202
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,850
Because that person

203
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,320
is my father.

204
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,210
Please...

205
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,150
Please...

206
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,210
be happy.

207
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,390
Tell my mother

208
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,000
that I'm sorry.

209
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,690
Young Master.

210
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,880
Yi Dae Yeop.

211
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,710
Young Master!

212
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,220
- Young Master! 
 - Yi Dae Yeop!

213
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,610
Yi Dae Yeop!

214
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,040
You must not die like this.

215
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,750
Young Master!

216
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,000
You can't die like this!

217
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,050
Yi Dae Yeop!

218
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,090
Young Master!

219
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,460
 Even just once,

220
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,900
 even just once,

221
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,420
 did you ever think of me

222
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,800
 as your own child?

223
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,090
Excuse me... Father.

224
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,570
What is it?

225
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,400
Since Dae Yeop is dead, obviously, nobody can inherit the throne.

226
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,940
Should we delay the rebellion...

227
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,050
Didn't I tell you last time to have someone ready in advance?

228
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,200
I'm sorry.

229
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,070
Go out.

230
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,210
What are you doing? How dare you come in here?

231
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,550
Because it's been reported that a group of despicable people trespassed here, we are here to investigate.

232
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,930
Even if it inconveniences you, please bear with us for a bit.

233
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,260
- Go and search! 
 - Yes, Sir!

234
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,450
You scoundrels! Get out this instant!

235
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,320
Since this room is small and looks like there is no place to hide in,

236
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,870
search other places.

237
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,100
- Make sure to search thoroughly!  
 - Yes.

238
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,190
I don't know if my nephew and his family got away safely.

239
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,110
Oh my! Orabeoni Chun Bae! Long time no see!

240
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,910
I don't know her! It's a misunderstanding.

241
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,310
Why is a stranger trying to talk to me?

242
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,030
Orabeoni Chun Bae! I'll see you in a bit.

243
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,170
You got me wrong! It's a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.

244
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,800
Just what have you spent your time doing?

245
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,250
There's no woman you don't know.

246
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,680
The only woman to me is... court lady Jo.

247
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,410
Oh... hi there, Orabeoni!

248
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,080
Oh hey...

249
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,100
It's a misunderstanding!

250
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,870
Where is the princess?

251
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, th-this way. This way.

252
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,030
Let go! Don't touch me.

253
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,880
Are you uncomfortable helping the westerners because of me?

254
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,160
While I was trying to rescue you...

255
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,340
I couldn't figure out another way.

256
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,440
You did well.

257
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,460
I also think that the only way to catch Yi I Cheom in this situation...

258
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,860
is a coup.

259
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,970
I do not want to endanger the whole family again for my sake alone, least of all you.

260
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,320
Nor am I confident I could do so.

261
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,610
So please... think of it as a coup for my sake.

262
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,150
But if we succeed...

263
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,940
his majesty will be dethroned.

264
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,740
It is said that the king is the father of the people.

265
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,090
But Father is someone who abandoned his own daughter to maintain power.

266
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,890
What could such a man do for his people?

267
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,640
Water flows down from the top, and complaint collects at the top.

268
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,890
All this time I have turned a blind eye because he was my father.

269
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,410
But while I have been with you, I have heard the grievances against my father from everywhere.

270
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,270
What's wrong must be corrected.

271
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:00,550
Anyone who knowingly does wrong and does not correct their ways...

272
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,530
they will definitely be met with the day of regret.

273
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,050
So please do what you must do.

274
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,060
I'm sorry.

275
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,990
Don't say such things. How could I not know your true feelings?

276
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,600
So please... don't suffer for my sake again.

277
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,150
Thank you.

278
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,470
No matter what happens...

279
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,080
I will save His Majesty and royal consort Yun's lives.

280
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,850
As unlikely as this may be, please don't have second thoughts.

281
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,540
I will be by your side to the very end.

282
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,380
Even the heavens won't be able to tear us apart.

283
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,370
Do you understand what I'm saying?

284
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,140
Ahem! So I was saying... um...

285
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,430
You were saying what?

286
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,580
- You heard it all, right? 
 - Yeah.

287
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,380
You hopelessâ€”!

288
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,110
What about Mother?

289
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,590
I brought her here. Cha Dol and Yeon Ok as well.

290
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,540
I think I need to leave right after seeing Mother,

291
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,600
so please take good care of her.

292
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,700
Oh, of course...

293
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,000
Father!

294
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,820
Forgive me, Mother.

295
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,980
As long as you're safe.

296
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,760
Please receive my bow.

297
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,360
No need. You can bow later.

298
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
When you're safely home. I'll receive your bow then.

299
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,220
She was so worried, so I briefly filled her in.

300
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,860
He said this was a critically urgent matter.

301
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,220
Don't worry about us. Go on ahead.

302
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,920
While I'm not here...

303
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,900
Don't worry. I will protect Grandmother and Aunt,

304
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,180
so you make sure you aren't hurt, and come back home soon, all right?

305
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,250
Then I'll give you my greetings after I'm done.

306
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,790
Yes.

307
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,010
You can stop now.

308
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,340
Why won't you at least cry?

309
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:58,020
Whether they succeed in the coup or not, our future is set in stone.

310
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,390
Why are you trying so hard to pretend nothing's wrong?

311
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,560
Since you already have Chun Bae...

312
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,450
I won't worry about you.

313
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,980
Your Highness...

314
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,930
Please watch after my husband. Cha Dol too...

315
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,880
What are you planning to do?

316
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,270
Didn't you just say it with your own lips?

317
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,430
Our future is already set in stone.

318
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,540
Your Highness, I meantâ€”

319
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,880
Of course, I believe that my husband will succeed no matter what.

320
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,500
So I will no longer be able to remain by his side.

321
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,820
If we look for it. If we try hard enough, there will be a way.

322
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,330
In this world, there is no way

323
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,780
for an ousted king's daughter to be with the queen dowager's nephew.

324
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,260
Your Highness!

325
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,050
Your Highness!

326
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,130
Sit.

327
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:11,000
I am yet a princess, and you are a servant.

328
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,770
This may be my final order,

329
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,770
so please follow my command.

330
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,920
Sit.

331
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,910
Oh, no, Your Highness! Your Highness!

332
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,090
Thank you for everything.

333
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,690
For raising this worthless girl and taking care of her.

334
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,500
This debt of gratitude...

335
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,630
I will never forget it.

336
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,810
Wait, Your Highness...

337
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm sorry.

338
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,590
For making your life difficult until the very end.

339
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm truly sorry.

340
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,830
Not at all, Your Highness.

341
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,730
No matter where you go...

342
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,110
no matter what you do...

343
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,760
I'll always be with you.

344
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,390
No matter what, I'll never...

345
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,570
leave you by yourself.

346
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,650
What happened so far?

347
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,510
The insurgency is set to take place at night on the12th.

348
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,460
Were you able to convince the general of training?

349
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,490
Once his men move, it'll mean certain defeat.

350
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,190
Because of the letter you gave me from the Dowager Queen, he has agreed to cooperate.

351
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,300
You promised to spare his majesty, Princess Hwa In, and royal consort Yun.

352
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,680
Don't ever forget that.

353
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,710
I understand.

354
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,720
More importantly, on the day of the insurrection, we pressed court lady Kim to have a feast in the backcourt.

355
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,230
That is when you have to capture his majesty.

356
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,090
Can you do it?

357
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,960
Your Majesty, the chief state councillor wishes to speak with you.

358
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,720
Tell him to come in.

359
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,280
Yes.

360
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,070
You should come and share a drink with me.

361
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,300
Your Majesty, I am sorry to inform you...

362
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,300
A report has come in that the general of training Yi Hong Rip and the Westerners...

363
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,570
are plotting treason!

364
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,240
Your Majesty! You must immediately arrest General Yi Hong Rip,

365
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,820
and mobilize your soldiers to capture Prince Neungyang and every single Westerner.

366
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,130
Gather the head of the investigation bureau, minister of war, and the police chiefs in secret.

367
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,080
And have the general of training questioned.

368
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,840
What shall we do with the left state councillor?

369
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,350
He will only amplify our problems, so don't call him.

370
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,450
Summon Kim Dae Seok and Kim Ja Jeom.

372
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,480
You were planning treason?

373
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,220
How could you suggest such a horrible thing? Treason?

374
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,690
We are merely gathering troops to capture treacherous subject Yi I Cheom.

375
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,730
Please think.

376
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,050
This man is basically the king's son-in-law.

377
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,290
Do you think he could plot treason against him?

378
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,570
There's no deceit in my words. Please believe me, My Lady.

379
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,390
Can I believe him?

380
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,540
Yes. You can believe him.

381
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,650
Since this is coming from none other than you, I will trust you.

382
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,410
In turn...

383
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,330
Even if you take control,

384
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,210
don't forget your promise to overlook my mistakes.

385
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,650
Do you understand?

386
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,290
Of course.

387
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,040
How could a man say two conflicting things with one mouth?

388
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,480
Please believe me, My Lady.

389
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,880
Kim Ja Jeom is not a man who would ever plot treason, Your Majesty!

390
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,790
He is a loyal subject!

391
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,280
Is Gae Si right?

392
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,810
- Your Majesty, the interrogation court isâ€” 
 - Are Gae Si's words true?

393
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,170
Is it treason or not?

394
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,410
Court Lady Kim's words are true.

395
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,170
Your Majesty! This is a critically urgent matter!

396
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,030
Disband the interrogation court and release everyone.

397
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,520
Your Majesty!

398
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,110
Didn't you hear me? I told you to release the Westerners.

399
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,230
I'm now sick of hearing about treason.

400
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,410
Just have everyone go back.

401
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,070
I no longer want to continue the feast. Tell everyone to leave.

402
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

403
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,290
You follow me, Kim Dae Seok.

404
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,270
Is Hwa In doing well?

406
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,820
I abandoned Hwa In for my own safety.

408
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,450
And you ignored your own safety to save Hwa In.

409
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,950
You lied to me today.

410
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,410
I am terribly sorry, Your Majesty!

411
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,080
Stop saying you're sorry.

412
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,160
Does someone who is sorry dare lie to me?

413
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,550
Then again...

414
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,920
It's not just you who deceived me.

415
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,770
Gae Si joined hands with Kim Ja Jeom and lied to me to save her own neck.

416
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,340
Even that fool Jung Yeong lied to me in order to help you.

417
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,270
There's nobody under the heavens whom I can trust.

418
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,400
I'm exhausted.

419
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,420
To lie and to be deceived. To be suspicious again and again...

420
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,390
All of it sickens me now.

421
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,580
I'm sure everyone believes I'm wrong.

422
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,960
My subjects, who were like my hands and feet...

423
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,020
my people, my wife, and even my own daughter...

424
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,120
They have all resented and given up on me.

425
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,700
Those olden days...

426
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,440
when I led the people...

427
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,170
fighting alongside them, feeling their pains, all of the dreams I had...

428
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,200
They have all become futile.

429
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,520
"I shall never be like my father."

430
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,660
Again and again, I formed that determination in my heart.

431
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
Thinking back on it now...

432
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,230
I have become an even greater monster than him!

433
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,350
I abandoned my only daughter...

434
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,320
what in the world was I trying to protect?

435
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,260
I don't even remember.

436
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,320
It really is bullshit.

437
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,060
Isn't that right?

438
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,910
Your Majesty.

439
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:02,720
However... I am still your king, so I will give you one last order.

440
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,090
Please command me.

441
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,610
Block Yi I Cheom.

442
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,140
Whether it's his son or anyone in the royal family...

443
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,880
If his chosen person becomes king, then Yi I Cheom

444
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,070
will play the king himself and do whatever he wants.

445
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,200
As long as it's not Yi I Cheom, I am fine with anyone.

446
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,310
Make sure.  Make sure you block him. Do you understand?

447
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,250
I will carry out your orders, Your Majesty!

448
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,610
Take it.

449
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,990
As Hwa In's father, I am giving my son-in-law a drink.

450
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,480
What are you waiting for?

451
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,560
I will leave Hwa In... I mean...

452
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,930
I will leave Su Gyeong in your hands.

453
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,860
I failed to protect her, but I ask you to do it instead.

454
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,990
This isn't an order...

455
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,600
But a sincere request.

456
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,150
As your son-in-law, to his father-in-law...

457
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,570
this will be my first and final...

458
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,370
bow to you.

459
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,080
Being stubborn will only add to your pain.

460
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,040
Don't you know that no one is strong enough to withstand torture?

461
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,410
How dare you, you bastard!

462
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,720
Are you all right?

463
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
Thank you.

464
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,690
For now, escape the palace walls and...

465
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,870
Get to the regimentâ€”! My Lord!

466
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,130
Go on ahead.

467
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,960
Will you be all right?

468
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,220
Yes.

469
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,690
Go and do as we planned.

470
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,590
How did you know about this?

471
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,250
I suspected that this rascal would disobey the order to free the general of training.

472
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,970
So I came here to teach him a lesson. But it seems I was a step late.

473
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:02,740
My Lord. It's not too late to join hands with the Westerners.

474
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,300
Are you joking?

475
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,290
It'll be good to at least give it serious considerationâ€”

476
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,940
Enough!

477
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,640
If his majesty weren't turning a blind eye to this,

478
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,800
you would already be dead by my hands.

479
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,380
I learnt that Yu Rang said a man should die a loyal death for the one who knows the worth of him.

480
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:29,560
I'm not Yu Rang, but still, I have only one lord.

481
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,020
This night will be a long one, it seems. So be careful.

482
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,800
You too, My Lord. Stay safe.

483
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,410
Your Excellency, the first young master has sent a letter.

484
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,670
Quickly bring it.

485
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,900
False accusation...

486
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,910
If it's a false accusation, then you are saying that it was a lie about the treason?

487
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,140
He is saying that it was a false accusation, right?

488
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,070
 I even wrote a letter and did whatever you asked of me.

489
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,450
 Please spare me.

490
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,490
I will spare you.

491
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,070
Thank you!

492
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,290
You don't need to be thankful.

493
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,300
It's only until your father is captured.

494
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,320
When my brother-in-law asked you to spare him,

495
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,200
did you spare him?

496
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,380
T...That is... So what happened was...

497
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,470
I definitely told you.

498
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,080
I will make sure I pay you back for his death.

499
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,840
Spare me...  (informal speech)  
No, no, please spare me!  (changing to formal speech)

500
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,750
If you spare me, I will give you money or whatever you need...

501
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,580
So just this once, please spare me...

502
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,170
This is also on behalf of Chil Seong.

503
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,180
How many soldiers are there?

504
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,480
It's 1,200.

505
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,660
You are saying that it's only 1,200?

506
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,010
There were quite a few who left due to the report of treason.

507
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,320
- I'm sorry.  
- No.

508
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,530
The arrow has already been shot. What's the use in regretting now?

509
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,200
Absolutely! Absolutely!

510
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,290
Oust the lawless Gwanghae and Yi I Cheom.

511
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,910
Let's raise the Jongmyo Shrine and the Court upright!

512
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,540
They are not the enemy.

513
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,790
Everyone, put your swords away.

514
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,520
Everyone who disobeys the orders will be beheaded following the military discipline.

515
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,010
Where is His Excellency Prince Neungyang?

516
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,640
He went to the Danbong Gate.

517
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,980
Everyone, step away!

518
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,200
You won't be able to block it anyway.

519
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,860
If you die here, who do you think will acknowledge you?

520
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,780
Don't die a useless death. Just escape.

521
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,990
Quickly!

522
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,790
I will open the door...

523
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,000
So, everyone step away!

524
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,690
What happened to the Donhwa Gate?

525
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,060
It's already opened.

526
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,960
We just need to capture King Gwanghae.

527
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,910
Will you go with us?

528
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,110
I will go to capture Yi I Cheom.

529
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,800
I understand.

530
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,520
Let's go.

531
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,950
Your Majesty, it seems like there is some sort of mishap.

532
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,600
Your Majesty!

533
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,980
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

534
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,090
Your Majesty, it's a coup!

535
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,710
Your Majesty!

536
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,740
Is it Yi I Cheom?

537
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,320
It doesn't seem to be Yi I Cheom.

538
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,600
Then, it must be the Westerners.

539
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,260
You must quickly escape, Your Majesty.

540
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,440
Your Majesty!

541
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,870
It's fine. Just go capture Yi I Cheom.

542
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,940
If you lose track of him, everything will be in vain.

543
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,980
I won't leave.

544
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,150
It's a royal order!

545
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,650
Now, are you saying that you aren't going to listen to my orders?

546
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,780
Your Majesty!

547
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,580
Drag her away right now!

548
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,320
Yes!

549
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,520
Is this a betrayal?

550
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,610
The reason I've endured the humiliation of licking your toes until now...

551
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,190
was all for today.

552
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,540
Take this wench away and lock her up.

553
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,110
Arrest the queen and the concubines of the ousted king.

554
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,550
Yes!

555
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,350
Let go of me!

556
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,900
I will leave on my own.

557
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,810
What are you doing? We have to leave.

558
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,370
The rebel troops have started to search.

559
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,120
We need to leave quickly.

560
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,990
His Majesty... What happened with His Majesty?

561
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,440
Quickly! Quickly!

562
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,830
It was you?

563
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,300
Did you ask Jung Yeong to bring me here?

564
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,370
How can I dare to make my royal father come and go?

565
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,610
Then, was it him?

566
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,040
Was no part of your body harmed?

567
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,220
If you just wait a little,

568
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,440
As soon as I finish the preparations, I will escort you.

569
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,700
- What are you talking about? 
- Since you can not stay here,

570
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,260
I am telling you that I will escort you.

571
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,400
Are you saying this knowing how dangerous it is to accompany me now?

572
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,660
Will I be any safer moving alone?

573
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,890
Don't you even hate your father?

574
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,190
I do.

575
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,570
But no matter how much I hate you,

576
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,400
You are the only father I have in this world.

577
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,670
Does this mean you forgive me?

578
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,630
Father...

579
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,670
The tide has already turned against the king.

580
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,010
Submissively accept the binding rope, Lord.

581
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,120
Come at me.

582
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,930
Attack him!

583
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,630
I thought you had escaped.

584
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,240
What happened with Won Yeop?

585
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,580
He is captured by my hands.

586
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,880
Have you killed him?

587
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,370
He's still alive.

588
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,650
All the decisions I have made were

589
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,600
the decisions for this country Joseon.

590
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,540
It's probably your version of the Joseon Dynasty.

591
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:19,190
If I think about the grudge regarding my family, I want to slit your throat right now.

592
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,950
However, for the sake of my friend ...

593
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,230
I'm holding back because he thinks of you as a father.

594
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,420
Come out.

595
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,360
Dae Yeop?

596
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,130
What did you do with Dae Yeop's body?

597
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,820
I took him to a sunny place,

598
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,820
and I buried him properly.

599
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,170
Thank you.

600
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,040
King Gwanghae defied the heavens,  destroyed humanity,

601
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,790
He has committed crimes towards the royal family and the country,

602
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,650
and earned the people's grudges.

603
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:39,400
How can a man who, as the king of the country, has committed such a grievous offense,

604
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,460
become the parent of the people, or succeed to the throne,

605
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,700
and follow the royal ancestors' wish?

606
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,600
We will dethrone Gwanghae.

607
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,080
Prince Neungyang put down the foolish and incompetent man, restored morality and tightened discipline.

608
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,630
The royal court and the country is stable again.

609
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,500
Because his charitable deeds are grand,

610
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,650
heaven and earth, even the people are relying on him.

611
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:15,380
He is worthy to succeed to the throne as the successor of King Seonjo.

612
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,170
Bring the royal seal and the royal stamp of approval.

613
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,150
I am putting this country, Joseon, into your hands.

614
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,670
I will keep it in mind,  Your Royal Highness.

615
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:59,700
I will fix everything that's been wrong.

616
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,710
I swear to heaven to correct evil practices and make a fresh start

617
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:06,240
in accordance with you and my royal mother's will.

618
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,060
I will pardon everyone who was punished for fabricated crimes,

619
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:18,290
being outspoken, or who has been found guilty by association.

620
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:22,080
Grand Prince Yeongchang Yi Ui, Prince Imhae Yi Jin,

621
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,220
Prince Neungchang Yi Jeon, Prince Jinreung Yi Tae Gyeong,

622
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:32,150
and Prince of the Court Yeonheung Buwongun Kim Je Nam. Their status is reinstated.

623
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,360
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

624
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,380
I can't find Royal Consort Yun.

625
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,540
Did you hide her away?

626
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,920
What are you saying?

627
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,680
If you're hiding the princess or Royal Consort Yun, hand them over immediately.

628
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,360
It's something I don't know about.

629
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,680
I'm saying this for your sake.

630
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,970
Don't you know they will think you're working with the ousted king, if you're with them?

631
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:15,200
I told you that I don't know their whereabouts.

632
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:19,420
Don't do anything that you will regret later.

633
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,760
I have my eyes on you.

634
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,630
I'm asking for the great precepts.*

635
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,860
 (It is to renounce the secular world and enter the Buddhist Order as a Buddhist nun).

636
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:55,780
Once you have the Buddhist initiation, you can never go back.

637
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,550
You won't regret it?

638
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,940
No.

639
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,190
You must shave your head first.

640
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:13,450
Go to the main hall and do 108 prostrations

641
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:19,040
to wash away all lingering attachments in your heart.

642
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,090
Yes.

643
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,260
I faithfully bow to Amitabha and the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion asking for guidance.

644
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,600
For one last time, I will ask you again.

645
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,350
You won't regret it?

646
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,390
I won't.

647
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,350
I will carry out the shaving of your head.

648
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:55,000
It seems like the blade is bad. I must go to change the scissors.

649
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,570
Close your eyes and wait just a moment.

650
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:51,590
