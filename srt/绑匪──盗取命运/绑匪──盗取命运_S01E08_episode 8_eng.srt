00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,590
 Kwon Yuri

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,180
 Shin Hyeon Soo

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,940

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,050
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,380
The Youngest Master is here!

7
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,720
The Youngest Master is here!

8
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,380
Father... It is your son, Dae Yeop.

9
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,020
Is there anyone outside? 
  Episode 8

10
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,570
Dae Yeop!

11
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,840
Dae Yeop, are you all right?

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Orabeoni, it is all my fault. I told him to do everything.

13
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,020
Get out.

14
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,830
You should leave.

15
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,770
Do you not even see the blood?

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,010
Do you not know what this bastard has done?

17
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,470
He left his family because of some girl.

18
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,140
Just some girl? Watch your words.

19
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,860
Drag him away immediately and lock him up!

20
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,420
Where are you taking him when he's bleeding so profusely?

21
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,970
- Move aside. 
- Brother.

22
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,990
Didn't I order you to move aside immediately?

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,770
Why are you being like this? Do you really plan on killing this child?

24
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,090
Aunt!

25
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,590
Aunt, are you alright?

26
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,800
She has nothing to do with this.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,690
I was the only one, I'm the only one responsible for this.

28
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,360
You fool! Shut your mouth.

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,590
Our family is about to be ruined because of you.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,020
Must our family be obliterated,

31
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,910
and must your brother and I lose our heads

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,690
before you come to your senses?

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,220
Such a thing will never happen.

34
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,320
If you place your trust in me, I will definitely settle matters.

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,520
Settle matters? How can someone like you settle matters?

36
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,530
I found out where Sister-in-law is.

37
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,110
Let us go. You know who this person is.

38
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,290
How are you going to handle the consequences of the king finding out?

39
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,410
It does bother me that I'm treating someone so precious this way.

40
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,750
But I believe the His Majesty will understand as well.

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,920
What was the reason for holding me here by saying it was Father's command?

42
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,450
If your words aren't a lie, let me meet with Father immediately.

43
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,390
I apologize, but His Majesty also commanded not to allow you to see him.

44
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,630
Even if you are uncomfortable, if you wait patiently for a little while,

45
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,910
the king will send further instructions. I'll be going now.

46
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,600
Excuse me!

47
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,060
Your Highness, do you think he's telling the truth?

48
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,260
He has no reason to lie.

49
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,030
I just realized... Why I got dragged all the way over here.

50
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,890
I hope nothing bad has happened.

51
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,790
She's the king's daughter, there's no way he'll treat her inappropriately.

52
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,490
No... Not the princess, but that young master.

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,960
We have to trust him.

54
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,490
She's at Kim Ja Jeom's house?

55
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,840
Yes. I confirmed that she's trapped at Kim Ja Jeom's house.

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,460
Father, if it's Kim Ja Jeomâ€”

57
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,420
From what I can gather, he's not the only one involved.

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,190
I think this was done under His Majesty's secret command.

59
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,790
If there's even an inkling of a lie,

60
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,160
both you and your aunt won't be safe.

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,160
If I were afraid of dying, I wouldn't have returned on my own two feet.

62
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,530
However, Aunt has nothing to do with this.

63
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,410
Please believe me.

64
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,540
Father, he's telling us to believe him,  but can you believe that the king is involved?

65
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,960
His Majesty doesn't even know that the princess is alive.

66
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,630
Isn't this boy spouting too much nonsense?

67
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,290
He is aware.

68
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,090
I personally visited the king and personally delivered the news of her being alive.

69
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,340
Look at this. Saying that he saw the king?

70
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,960
How could someone like himâ€”?

71
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,960
Do you have evidence to prove your words?

72
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,620
Please check inside the chest.

73
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,220
The case that contained the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon should be empty.

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,200
What?

75
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,750
Why is this...? Did you by chance...?

76
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,550
Yes. I took the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon and went to see His Majesty.

77
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,450
The one item that could've saved us from complete destruction...

78
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,600
You did something like this just to save your sister-in-law?

79
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,300
I did want to save Sister-in-law too...

80
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,030
However, I wanted to save the family, including you and Hyeong-nim.

81
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,190
I believed that this was the only way.

82
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,640
But ... Why is the princess who was supposed to be saved, captured by Kim Ja Jeom?

83
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,290
And why are you speaking of your own sins with your own mouth?

84
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,800
None of this makes sense.

85
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,930
The king deceived me.

86
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,660
And broke his promise with me.

87
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,030
 Please forgive my father, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,990
 You brought the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon, so surely I should forgive him.

89
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,820
 But what about Hwa In? What do you plan on doing with her?

90
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,980
 I will escort the Princess and go to a place where no one can find us.

91
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,930
 We'll live in hiding for the rest of our days.

92
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,720
 - Where is Hwa In?  
  - She is in Paju.

93
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,290
 Bring Hwa In in front of me, and I'll grant you your request.

94
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,390
I was foolish and miscalculated the situation. Forgive me.

95
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,960
You bastard! You've caused the situation to get this bad, and you dare to demand an apology?

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
I will accept my punishment for deceiving you

97
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,300
and stealing the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon at another time.

98
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,320
But right now, before His Majesty has access to the princess,

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,790
we need to help her escape Kim Ja Jeom's grasp. That's what's urgent.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,890
This is a critically urgent matter.

101
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,560
Father, you need to overlook my misdeeds for now and handle the situation with Sister-in-law.

102
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,630
We don't know when Kim Ja Jeom will move Sister-in-law to a different place.

103
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,660
We need to move right away.

104
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,800
Send Tae Chul to Kim Ja Jeom's house immediately,

105
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,590
and confirm whether Dae Yeop is telling the truth.

106
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,800
Yes, Father.

107
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,340
This isn't enough, gather more men.

108
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,100
Gather everyone in the household, and check once more that nobody suspicious is loitering around the area.

109
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,790
- Yes, my Lord. 
- Don't worry too much, my Lord.

110
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,930
Just put your trust in us.

111
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,750
Make sure you look over the underlings properly.

112
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,860
None of this can leak to the public. Do you understand?

113
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,890
I understand.

114
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,960
- Hurry! 
 - Yes.

115
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,030
I saw two women being dragged here.

116
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,130
As secrecy seems to be extremely important, they must be prominent figures.

117
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,180
Look, didn't I tell you? I told you they'd come here to check.

118
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,860
He's one heartless old man.

119
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Hey, it's because you didn't see him.

120
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,600
He had snake eyes like this, and said,

121
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,560
"do you want to die?" And I hated it so much.

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,590
I wanted to throw a punch, here and there.

123
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,530
Hey, are you listening?

124
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,970
Yes. You said you wanted to die.

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,730
I may as well have been a dog barking.

126
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,900
Are you that worried?

127
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,560
Worried about what?

128
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,430
Don't worry.

129
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,130
Even if we can't save her from them, this man is following the king's order.

130
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,460
It's a hundred times better than getting captured by that old man, the left state councillor or whatever.

131
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,830
Your Highness.

132
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,600
Earlier, you said you realized why we were dragged here.

133
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,370
What were you talking about?

134
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,950
What if I,  who was said to be dead, appear in front of everybody?

135
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,820
Who has the most to lose from it?

136
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,130
Are you saying that His Majesty is planning this... to use it against the left state councillor?

137
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,320
I don't think that's it.

138
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,430
I hope that's not the case either.

139
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,290
But... No matter how much I think about it. I can't think of any other reason.

140
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,160
Her ladyship is there.

141
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,520
- Are you sure? 
- Yes sir.

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,160
After hearing that the slave hunters brought in two women,

143
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,430
it's unmistakably her ladyship and Court Lady Jo.

144
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,700
And on top of that, he's calling in a bunch of other servants as well.

145
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,330
We need to take the princess out of that place immediately.

146
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,140
Hyeong-nim is right. We don't know when his majesty will take Sister-in-law.

147
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,700
Is my personal army ready?

148
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes.

149
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,360
All right.

150
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,930
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

151
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,470
Why are you causing such a fuss?

152
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,490
His majesty the king has come to visit.

153
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,470
Lord Nae Am came to see me all the way from Hapcheon, so I came out to greet him,

154
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,570
but then I heard that you were on sick leave, so I decided to pay you a visit.

155
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,140
I wonder if I've made you uncomfortable, with your ailing body and all.

156
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm so grateful for your concern, Your Majesty.

157
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,740
He's saying that he's disappointed because you didn't

158
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,640
come out to greet him in socks in your joy.

159
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,430
I just happened to be out on the porch.

160
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,500
In his heart, he was not only in socks, but completely barefoot, Your Majesty.

161
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,200
Aren't I correct?

162
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,760
You are correct, Your Excellency.

163
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,060
I was very worried after I heard you were on sick leave.

164
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,830
But you appear better than I thought you'd be, so I'm relieved.

165
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,080
I am grateful for your words, Your Majesty.

166
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,770
All right, you've shown enough fomalities.

167
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,230
The wind is cold, so make sure to head indoors.

168
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,150
You should head indoors as well.

169
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,270
Shouldn't they be here by now?

170
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,540
Why is there no news?

171
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,580
It'll be sundown soon.

172
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,450
 Believe me.

173
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,350
 No matter what it takes, I'll bring my family's personal army and cause a ruckus.

174
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,970
 You take that opportunity to save Sister-in-law then.

175
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,480
 I understand. I'll trust you then.

176
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,660
 Hey Ba Wu, if we trust in that young master and he doesn't come, we're going to lose our necks.

177
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,740
 He said to trust him. So let's try trusting him.

178
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,020
This won't do. I'll go see that young master.

179
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,000
Watch over her carefully.

180
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,600
But what is the police chief doing here at this time of day?

181
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,570
It's my  sunga-il today, Your Majesty.

182
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,110
From what I heard, you had sunga-il a few days ago too. 
  Sunga-il - a day off every ten days

183
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,270
In order to nurse me, he exchanged sunga-il with the right police chief.

184
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,860
You're quite the good son, aren't you?

185
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,750
You must be happy, Lord.

186
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,870
I've caused issues to his work over a private matter.

187
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,260
I feel terribly sorry, Your Majesty.

188
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,620
Is your youngest son out somewhere?

189
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,680
I remember calling him out to Hapcheon, but he never visited.

190
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,250
Is he avoiding me today too?

191
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,830
Of course not.

192
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,320
His majesty is here and all, so I told him to head to his room.

193
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,270
He will come to see you and pay his respects on another occasion.

194
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,170
There's no need.

195
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,640
Don't worry about me.

196
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,450
Nanny.

197
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,830
Yes, Your Highness.

198
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,980
Listen to what I have to say until the end.

199
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,110
Yes, please go ahead.

200
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,940
I think Father is trying to use me

201
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,610
to destroy my father-in-law and his household.

202
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,190
But I cannot follow through on Father's wishes.

203
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,680
Even you know that Father-in-law won't just go along with Father's wishes.

204
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,690
If something were to go awry, this nation of Joseon will be swept up in chaos.

205
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,400
And a bloody wind might settle over the nation.

206
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,530
To conclude, all of this happened because of me.

207
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,480
So I think I'm going to have to end things.

208
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,090
Your Highness... Your Highness, you can't.

209
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,230
What do you mean by "end things"? How can you say such things?

210
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,940
Your Highness, you can't do that. You can't!

211
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,790
Unless I am buried and dirt covers my eyes, you can't do such a thing, Your Highness.

212
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,320
It would prefer you killed me first, please, Your Highness!

213
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,080
- Your Highness! 
- What are you thinking?

214
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,510
What?

215
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,210
Don't worry, I wasn't planning on doing what you were thinking.

216
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,570
You said you would end things...

217
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,280
If we stay here without struggling, we'll be taken away by Kim Ja Jeom.

218
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,930
And be used by Father in his plot.

219
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,060
Before then, we need to leave this place quickly.

220
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,440
Excuse me.

221
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,760
Why are those people protecting that place?

222
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,550
The king has come to visit.

223
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,430
 I have to die and disappear...

224
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,940
 For everyone to become comfortable.

225
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,790
This must be the first time you're seeing this child, Your Majesty.

226
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,680
Have you seen me before?

227
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,400
I have seen you from afar before,

228
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,920
when you were visiting Sungkyunkwan.* 
  * an educational institution founded in 992.

229
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,660
So that was the case.

230
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,650
Did you hear that he's seen me before?

231
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

232
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,720
It happened a while back, so I don't recall it perfectly.

233
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,690
He said you made him a promise.

234
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,240
Is that so?

235
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,890
That happened in the past for me too, so I cannot recall it perfectly.

236
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,930
So, what kind of promise did I make?

237
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,220
This old man is also wondering,

238
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,310
what kind of promises was His Majesty making to young scholars.

239
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,930
Go ahead and respond.

240
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,290
You mentioned Shang Yang, the renowned chancellor of the Qin dynasty during the warring states period.

241
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,100
And how he built trust using a wooden pole.

242
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,610
You said that a politician's word is worth a thousand gold coins.

243
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,070
You said such a man should never lie.

244
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,350
And Your Majesty also promised me that you would do the same.

245
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,070
"Building trust using a wooden pole"...

246
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,190
Shang Yang paid ten gold pieces for moving a wooden pole,

247
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,870
because he promised ten.

248
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,130
And paid fifty when he promised fifty, and that's how he gained trust of the public.

249
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,810
If politicians dare to lie,

250
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,260
how could the citizens trust in and obey the government?

251
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,970
His Majesty's teaching was precious and wise.

252
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,960
Speaking of such things is easy, but following through is difficult.

253
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,070
Have you made Hwa In's mortuary tablet yet?

254
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,700
I heard that they cut an acorn tree that had existed for 200 years.

256
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,160
I wanted to make Hwa In's tablet with that.

257
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,140
You already had one made.

258
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,290
I still feel as if... Hwa In is alive.

259
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,240
How frustrating.

260
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,620
Everything is my fault, Your Majesty.

261
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,390
It is quite heart-breaking.

262
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,900
But I fear of the harm it would do to your royal personage,

263
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,180
so please do not be too concerned, Your Majesty.

264
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,950
And why is your forehead like that? Did you get hurt?

265
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,350
I was riding a horse and ended up falling.

266
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,290
Something terrible almost happened.

267
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,720
You're lucky it's only that.

268
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,760
I apologize for worrying you.

269
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,690
That's enough.

270
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,880
The scar doesn't look shallow, you should head out and rest.

271
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,860
No, I'm all right. You said you had something to say to me.

272
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,300
What do I have to talk about with you,

273
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,890
other than to set the date of your wedding?

274
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,450
I plan on staying in Hanyang for a few days.

275
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,060
We can talk about that at leisure.

276
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,830
I'll be leaving now.

277
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,010
No... I've been out of the palace for too long.

278
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,560
I will be leaving soon as well.

279
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,110
Now that His Majesty has left, I will have to leave as well.

280
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,190
You must be tired from traveling. You should rest before leaving.

281
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,560
Where are you headed to anyway?

282
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,790
Even if no one calls for me, I have a lot of places to go to.

283
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,990
I'll stop by if I'm thirsty for alcohol, just don't criticize me over it.

284
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,460
I'll have your favorite home-brewed liquor ready, so worry not, Your Excellency.

285
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm already salivating.

286
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,730
I came up because His Majesty called for me.

287
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,700
Please watch over yourself.

288
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,150
All right, let's go.

289
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,150
Why did the King and His Excellency Lord Nae Am*  suddenly visit us? 
 (Jeong In Hong, ex Chief State Councillor)

290
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,190
No matter what the reason is, finding Sister-in-law is the most pressing matter.

291
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,940
Dae Yeop is correct. We need to hurry.

292
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,380
What happened? Tell me!

293
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,250
Why can't you speak? Huh?

294
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,100
The young master is not coming, is it?

295
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,520
I'm telling you that you can't trust those men.

296
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,770
Should we just go home?

297
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,530
Even if it's by myself, I must go in.

298
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,590
Hey, have you lost your mind? How do you plan on saving them by yourself?

299
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,420
Hey, Ba Wu. It would be better that we wait a little longer.

300
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,530
That young master might contact us soon.

301
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,930
What if something happens in the meantime?

302
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,420
What problem? You said that she was your enemy's daughter and daughter-in-law.

303
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,600
For what reason are you going this far for that woman?

304
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,400
Are you perhaps...?

305
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,240
That's not it.

306
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,120
This whole situation happened because of you and me.

307
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,670
Since we caused this, we must take responsibility.

308
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,890
Hey, Ba Wu...

309
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,770
Ah, don't worry. I won't die. You don't know me?

310
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,530
Do whatever you want, you rotten man!

311
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,220
If I can't come out, tell that rotten young master he must rescue us. Got it?

312
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,220
You said that you won't die. You said that you won't die!

313
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,500
Hey, wait!

314
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,930
I won't die, alright?

315
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,860
B-Ba Wu!

316
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,860
- Are you ready to go to the palace? 
 - Yes.

317
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,910
My lord!

318
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,010
The Left State Councillor has come and insists that he needed to search this place all of a sudden.

319
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,720
What did you say?

320
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,170
- First of all, hide them in an obscure place. 
 - Yes.

321
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,460
You must hide in an obscure place. Got it?! Carefully escort them too.

322
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,110
Highness! Your Highness!

323
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,700
Highness!

324
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,970
- What should we do? 
 - Hurry in and check!

325
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,480
Do we have to go inside?

326
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,170
Hey!

327
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,110
Your Highness!

328
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,080
Your Highness! Is there nobody outside? Your Highness!

329
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,160
Hurry! Get him!

330
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,280
Your Highness, tightly! Tie him tightly!

331
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,170
No! Y-y-you!

332
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,630
How did you know about this place?

333
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,380
Oh, my damn noggin!

334
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,940
Blood!

335
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,010
Don't you know how precious this damn noggin is?

336
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,730
Are you going to take responsibility?

337
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,680
Are you all right?

338
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,580
Ah, yes. Are you injured anywhere?

339
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,570
I'm all right.

340
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,590
Why is it like this here?!

341
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,260
Why did you arrive now?

342
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,910
I will ask you one thing.

343
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,060
Do you want to live?

344
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,360
Do you want to live?

345
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,060
Answer me. Do you want to live?

346
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,230
Yes, I want to live.

347
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,690
Fine.

348
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,240
Then...

349
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,200
Let's die.

350
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,100
What are you doing here without any notice?

351
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,970
You brought your entire household along with your private army.

352
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,200
People might mistake this to be an attempt at revolting.

353
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,770
How many times must I tell you

354
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,150
that you should watch your mouth?

355
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,980
When did you say the captain of the royal guard would visit?

356
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,380
There was a notice not too long ago, so he should be coming soon.

357
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,740
I'm a little busy due to orders from his majesty,

358
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,350
so hurry up and tell us for what reason you came here.

359
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,940
There was a report that there is a thief hidden in this house.

360
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,830
My house?

361
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,090
Yes.

362
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,250
I worried he would escape, and as I wasn't able to alert the police,

363
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,550
I brought the family's personal army instead.

364
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,930
Would you cooperate with the search?

365
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,160
What if I can't?

366
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,860
Since it is a violent criminal that we must capture at all costs,

367
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,730
I may have to be impolite.

368
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,160
That's fine.

369
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,460
Search as much as your heart desires.

370
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,770
Do you have the confidence to handle the consequences?

371
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,740
What do you mean by the "consequences"?

372
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,230
Isn't it the responsibility of us nobles to help with public service?

373
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,070
Why?

374
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,480
Did you perhaps hide a violent criminal?

375
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,130
If by any chance we find anyone suspicious,

376
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,240
you must handle the consequences.

377
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,450
With your life, I mean.

378
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,660
Search everywhere!

379
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,560
Yes!

380
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,130
Did you find something?

381
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,330
Isn't this Sister-in-law's head covering?

382
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,900
Dae Yeop...

383
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,440
This can't be...

384
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,430
Ba Wu. Ba Wu!

385
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,910
Hyeong-nim!

386
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,170
Ba Wu!

387
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,860
Court Lady Jo!

388
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,610
Orabeoni!

389
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,690
What is this? How can this be?

390
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:16,760
Orabeoni! Please let us through.

391
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,800
- You're so good-looking! 
 - You came to see me last time.

392
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,750
Let them pass!

393
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:39,040
Thank you, Oraboeoni!

394
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,570
What happened?

395
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,690
It seems they already escaped.

396
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,370
They already escaped?

397
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,100
Did you find some kind of evidence?

398
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,870
Well that...

399
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,230
It looks like I caused you trouble because of a false report.

400
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,610
Accept my sincere apologies.

401
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:40,310
Not at all. Your intentions were good. Don't worry about it.

402
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,210
Thank you.

403
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:48,130
I will make sure to pay you for this debt some day. Look forward to it.

404
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:54,060
Yes. I will look forward to it. I will take my leave.

405
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,220
Tell everyone to prepare without any mistakes.

406
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,150
They may change their minds and assault us again.

407
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,990
- And secretly release the servants to find the princess. 
 - Yes.

408
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,190
Suicide, you say?

409
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,690
There's no other explanation why the princess isn't here.

410
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,760
That's merely his speculation.

411
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,420
There's no evidence anywhere that Sister-in-Law used this rope,

412
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,490
so we must not make hasty conclusions.

413
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,520
Both you and Tae Chul claimed the princess was here.

414
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,210
You made sure to keep someone here until we arrived, correct?

415
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,330
Yes.

416
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,260
If this doesn't prove her suicide, are you saying she flew out of here?

417
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,470
Then shouldn't there be a corpse?

418
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,720
That... Why would they keep a corpse around the house? They probably buried herâ€”

419
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,260
Even so, she's still the princess.

420
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,450
Someone under the orders of the king would not treat her highness's body that way.

421
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,110
How many people were watching over this house until we arrived?

422
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,490
There were two.

423
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:04,300
In order to prepare for the unexpected, I had one to follow them, and one to report back to me.

424
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,640
There is no way two men could observe this whole place.

425
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,740
We have to consider the possibility that he hid Sister-in-law away.

426
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,530
Dae Yeop has a point.

427
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,260
I should've prepared for every outcome.

428
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,080
I was short-sighted, Father.

429
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,130
Is there any place you suspect she might have gone to?

430
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,070
There isn't.

431
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,940
Search the area thoroughly. And keep watch over this place too.

432
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,990
Yes.

433
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:42,850
He may try to hide her somewhere outside the capital, so make sure to seal off the gates.

434
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,490
I'll alert the minister of defense. He'll help you if you ask him.

435
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,580
Yes, Father.

436
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,030
Have them check every woman, young and old. And Dae Yeopâ€”

437
00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:00,150
I will search this area, and think about any place they could be.

438
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,780
And I will go to the palace and block all of the gates. Everyone move!

439
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,590
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

440
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,680
Sister-in-law... where are you?

441
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,180
Father! Your Highness!

442
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,470
Cha Dol. Have you been well?

443
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,690
Your Highness...

444
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,480
Cha Dol! Don't you see your father?

445
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,280
Father, were you hurt?

446
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,390
Do you only see it now? You little runt!

447
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,590
Don't be hurt, Father. I can't live without you.

448
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,190
You lay down. I'll prepare the mattresses for you.

449
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,680
Hyeong-nim, you can prepare the furnace and you get me something to drink.

450
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,810
That looks like something he can doâ€”

451
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,950
O-oh! Yes, I'll do all of that. Don't worry.

452
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,440
Let's go in.

453
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,030
You can lie here, Your Highness.

454
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,940
Go ahead and sit for now.

455
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,270
Were you... not hurt anywhere?

456
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,600
I am fine. It looks like you need rest more than me.

457
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,780
Let's clean that blood off first.

458
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm fine.

459
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,040
Are you all right, Your Highness?

460
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,100
I am fine.

461
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,630
They say it's pointless to raise a child. Cha Dol, you...

462
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,030
Don't you see your father?

463
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,830
It's not that... Her highness is worrying about you.

464
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,650
So I'm worrying about her highness.

465
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,290
Did you worry a lot?

466
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:42,020
Of course. I thought I would never see you again.

467
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,780
But your wrists...

468
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,430
Wrists? What about them?

469
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,050
Not at all. It's nothing serious, so don't worry.

470
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,930
I wouldn't worry if you'd stop making me worry.

471
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,470
That's what I want to say.

472
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,380
There they go again.

473
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,850
Then, I'll take my leave.

474
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,720
If I die by myself, that's all well and good,

475
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,650
but don't you have Cha Dol?

476
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,670
Don't you think about Cha Dol at all?

477
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,530
- But ... I ...
 - Damn you!

478
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,470
W-what... "damn"â€”?

479
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,100
Did you think that if you came back to rescue me, I would shed tears of gratitude?

480
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,850
I will take care of my own business,

481
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,710
so I'm telling you that someone who can't take care of himself shouldn't make a fuss.

482
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,590
I am simply returning your words back to you.

483
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,340
Surely you remember your own words?

484
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,100
I mean... what I said back then didn't mean thatâ€”

485
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,900
Wow... like a thief blaming the owner. What? "Damn"? "Fuss"?

486
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,250
Then... why did you say that to me?

487
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,150
Well that was because... you were being reckless,
you could've diedâ€”!

488
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,110
That is what I'm saying.

489
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,700
Then...

490
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:23,660
Are you telling me to leave you alone... whether you die or not?

491
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,600
That is right.

492
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:34,260
Fine. Next time, let's not care whether the other gets killed or not.

493
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,220
Th-that rude little scallywag! I ought toâ€”!

494
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,490
Please! Don't just hear the words he's saying. Listen to his heart! His heart!

495
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,820
Hey. Hey, Ba Wu!

496
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,850
What are you so happy about?

497
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,170
I'm just happy.

498
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:07,070
I don't mind if they fight every day like this. I just want Mom and Dad to stay together.

499
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,090
But why do you keep calling her "Mom"?

500
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,100
Do you not know who she is?

501
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,580
I do. But she told me to call her "Mom".

502
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,200
The runt.

503
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,990
It's not true, right?

504
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,010
What is?

505
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,840
It's not true. No. Of course not! It makes no sense!

506
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,820
But is it really not true?

507
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,370
I couldn't dare suspect that's true.

508
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,290
Oh dear! Look at these precious hands. The bruises!

509
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,900
But what about you?

510
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,490
Well, I don't even have anyone to show these hands to...

511
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,620
How impudent!

512
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,210
Ba Wu.

513
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,600
Both of you are just alike!

514
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,900
You're like birds of a father! You are!

515
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,080
It's "birds of a feather".

516
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,190
Oh... is that right?

517
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,010
So what are you going to do?

518
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,560
Hey, hey! Are you going to fight again?

519
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,530
What do mean, fight? I'm putting an end to this.

520
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,430
Hey, wait!

521
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,670
Make some kind of noise before entering!

522
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,770
Here! Brush, paper, and ink.

523
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,480
W-what is this?

524
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,600
Since you're dead, let's do it properly.

525
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,570
Maybe I should lie that Yi I Cheom stole the princess...

526
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,770
No, no.

527
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,770
It is still better to be honest.

528
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,770
Have you not found a trace of them?

529
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,870
We haven't, My Lord.

530
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,890
Your Excellency!

531
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,090
Th-this...

532
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,450
Have the servants leave the area.

533
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,020
Yes.

534
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,350
You want to make a deal with me?

535
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,600
That is correct.

536
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,550
Why should I make a deal with someone who took Princess Hwa In?

537
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,370
It would be easier to torture you and take her back myself.

538
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,250
Do you honestly believe I would tell you where she is?

539
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,180
The night is late.

540
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,550
Will you make a deal or not?

541
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,720
For me to make a deal with you, I need to benefit somehow.

542
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,420
But here, I'm only at a loss...

543
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,690
Why do you have nothing to gain? Didn't I save your life?

544
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,380
What did you say?

545
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:41,370
On my way here I noticed there were still people spying on this house.

546
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,360
If I hadn't taken the princess,

547
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,240
do you think that man Yi I Cheom would've left you alive?

548
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,860
It's not the first time he's accused a Westerner or a Southerner of treason.

549
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,770
Do you think his majesty would protect you then?

550
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,780
He's the kind of man who would use his only daughter like this.

551
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,910
Do you think he would oppose Yi I Cheom for your sake?

552
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,650
Do you really believe that?

553
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,330
What exactly is your identity?

554
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,020
Why is that important?

555
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,610
Of course, it's important.

556
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,250
How do I know you're not from Yi I Cheom himself?

557
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,950
And even so...

558
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,970
Moreover, if we do things your way and things go awry, it's the end of me.

559
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,430
I will introduce myself again.

560
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,610
I am the grandson of the  father-in-law of the late king Seonjo*. My name is Kim Dae Seok. 
  (father of Ghwanghe, the current king)

561
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,250
King Seonjo's father-in-law ... then you mean His Excellency lord Kim Je Nam.

562
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,650
That is correct.

563
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,680
I heard you were all killed.

564
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,760
So that is why your clothes are like this.

565
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,220
I have been living in hiding.

566
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:54,590
Now that you know my identity, you should know why

567
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,250
I cannot be on the same side as either the king or Yi I Cheom.

568
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,810
Now that we both share a secret that must not be revealed,

569
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,020
I trust you are on the same boat as me and tell you this.

570
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,070
Please give this suicide note to the king.

571
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,030
She said this was the only way to help everyone.

572
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,680
She had to die...

573
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,160
in order to save you and your family.

574
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,380
So...

575
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:15,760
Did you just watch her kill herself?

576
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,150
Answer me... please?

577
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,610
Did I not ask you?!

578
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,980
What is this?

579
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,020
This is what her highness left behind.

580
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,720
She could not do this to me.

581
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,920
There is no way.

582
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,210
 We are ultimately threads that cannot be together in this life.

583
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,460
 So I am cutting mine first to leave this world.

584
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,950
 I will hold my gratitude for you deeply in my heart.

585
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:34,480
 I suppose you'll never forgive me for leaving like this.

586
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,570
 But even if I become a wandering spirit of hell,

587
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:45,480
 I will desire that you meet new ties and forge new paths.

588
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,810
So you're telling me this is Hwa In's final testament.

589
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

590
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,830
Hwa In hung herself...

591
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,470
She killed herself, you say?

592
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:07,450
Your Majesty, please kill me for being unable to protect her highness.

593
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,280
Die.

594
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,790
Don't tell me to kill you. Kill yourself in the same way Hwa In did.

595
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,360
Your Majesty!

596
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,960
Should I bring you some rope to hang yourself with?

597
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,210
Please calm yourself and read the suicide note firstâ€”

598
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,360
I don't wish to read it. She abandoned her father's will and her own life.

599
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,480
Why would I read such a disrespectful wench's last testament?

600
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,890
Burn it immediately!

601
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,590
Is Jung Yeong outside?

602
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,020
Your Majesty!

603
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,720
Die. It's a royal decree.

604
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,870
Your Majesty! Please spare me!

605
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,350
Your Majesty!

606
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:56,760
Did you see? With their mouths they talk about "allegiance this" and "Your grace" that.

607
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,990
In the end, the king's subjects are men who only want to find a way to live for themselves.

608
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,880
These fools can't amount to more than dogs or pigs.

609
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,100
How am I supposed to raise Joseon with them?

610
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,260
Your Majesty! If you would only give me one more chanceâ€”!

611
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,590
Shut up!

612
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:13,710
If you flap your lips one more time, I will nail my blade into your mouth.

613
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,730
I told you so many times to be careful...

614
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,600
and you bring me a suicide note instead?

615
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,890
Do you know how much I toiled for this plan?

616
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:41,970
Do you know how much pain I tolerated, neglecting my own daughter in order to enact this plan?

617
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:47,490
I... the very king of Joseon!

618
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:52,290
I killed my one and only daughter for this!

619
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,330
Y-your Majeâ€”

620
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,850
- Let go. 
 - Your Majesty!

621
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,410
- It's a royal order.
 - Please calm yourself, Your Majesty!

622
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,380
You must calm yourself and ease your wrath!

623
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,400
Did I not say it was a royal order!

624
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,710
You dare ignore my royal order?

625
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:21,600
Yes... why don't you also beg for your life?

626
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,720
I only desire to follow you, Your Majesty.

627
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,020
Please kill me...

628
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,930
My headache has gotten too severe. Get me my medicine.

629
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,970
Yes, Your Majesty!

630
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,420
What do you plan to do with Kim Ja Jeom?

631
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,130
I can't abandon him since he knows about Hwa In, can I?

632
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,150
I have to call him back later to comfort him.

633
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:34,250
It's possible that he gets second thoughts, so watch over him carefully.

634
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,530
How is his majesty doing?

636
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:54,010
After taking his medicine, he was barely able to fall asleep.

637
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,980
His madness is getting more severe.

638
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,280
His rage is likely the biggest contributor.

639
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,040
Is it possible that Yi I Cheom used threats or appeasements

640
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,600
to give Kim Ja Jeom second thoughts?

641
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:15,000
I heard that the Left State Councillor invaded his home last night.

642
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,690
He's still spying on his home, so I don't think it's likely.

643
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,000
It's me.

644
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,120
Why are you doing this again?

645
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,150
Didn't you say with your own lips that there is no evidence she's alive?

646
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:54,080
Let's say she faked her own death in order to live, as you say.

647
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,030
But does it make sense to lie to you too?

648
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,240
It's not like she doesn't trust you.

649
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,250
There's no reason to fool you too, is there?

650
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,650
In order to fool everyone, especially Father...

651
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,080
she might have thought she would need to fool me first.

652
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,330
So what are you planning to do?

653
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,370
Aunt, I just need to check if she's alive orâ€”

654
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:19,630
And if your father finds out she's alive too?

655
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,920
What do you plan to do then?

656
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,920
I understand your concern for me.

657
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,720
But... there will be no way for Father to know about this.

658
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,110
I will make sure of it.

659
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,610
I will make a way for it.

660
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:40,050
If you plan to give up everything just to check on your sister-in-law's state,

661
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:43,100
I will report all of this to your father.

662
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,450
- Aunt! 
 - What? Do you think I won't?

663
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,430
To me, you are more important and more precious than my niece-in-law.

664
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:54,850
If I can only rescue you from your quagmire, what couldn't I do?

665
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:02,570
If you want to believe she's alive, go ahead.

666
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:06,440
But keep her alive in your heart only.

667
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,550
Let her be dead to the world and let her disappear from its gaze.

668
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,900
Did my brother tell you to check up on him?

669
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:35,700
He's so intoxicated, I wonder if he'll even recognize his brother...

670
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,960
Dae Yeop! Your brother is here.

671
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,350
Come to your senses!

672
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,160
Just look at you!

673
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,040
Hyeong-nim!

674
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,090
When you wake from your drunkenness, come to my room.

675
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:14,860
Hyeong-nim! Can you believe it?

676
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,090
I still can't believe it, I...

677
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,850
A suicide?

678
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:26,860
How could she just leave me with a solitary note like this?

679
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,690
How could she?

680
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,110
It is certain the princess is dead.

681
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,920
But there's no evidence. I can't just believe this suicide note.

682
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,600
Dae Yeop is your evidence.

683
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:45,430
If you would only see him, you would know what I'm talking about.

684
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,110
 Forgive me, Aunt.

685
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:00,290
 I no longer can live without her.

686
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,880
 Please protect her for my sake.

687
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,950
 Nay... I trust that you will.

688
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,790
 Run! Run! Hurry!

689
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,110
 - Grab them! 
 - Let's go!

690
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,120
It was definitely in this area. Definitely...

691
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,490
Wait wait!

692
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,960
This is too heavy! Take more out.

693
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,820
I only put in what I needed.

694
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,680
I don't understand why we're making such a fuss in the middle of the night.

695
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:00,640
Aren't there too many eyes during the daytime?

696
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,410
She's right, she is! Running away is more fun at night.

697
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,820
Don't you know "fight by night"?

698
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,320
Don't you mean "flight by night"?

699
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,580
Really? Since when?

700
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,380
If you aren't going to wear them, why do you carry them around?

701
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,260
What does it matter to you?

702
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,350
Don't get hurt again. Wear the shoes.

703
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,730
I'm going to head out first.

704
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,830
Move.

705
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,590
There's a reason why we had no choice but to do this.

706
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,810
What do you think will happen if everyone found out the princess was alive?

707
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:57,270
Do you still think she'll be safe then?

708
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:01,010
You cur. What do you know about any of this?

709
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:05,210
If you understand even a little bit of your sister-in-law's situation, then go back.

710
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,210
I told you to move.

711
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,720
We barely made a dead person out of her.

712
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,160
If you interfere, she'll be in danger again. Don't you understand?

713
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:17,160
So everything you said so far was a farce then?

714
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,790
All you wanted was her safety and happiness? Don't make me laugh.

715
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,780
Don't let your mouth run when you don't know anything.

716
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,320
In my eyes, all you want...

717
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,050
is just the lust of having her in your armsâ€”

718
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,590
- Why youâ€”! 
 - Brother-in-law!

719
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,990
Follow me.

720
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,170
Brother-in-law.

721
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:05,600
I decided to forget everything the moment you married my brother.

722
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:10,560
I thought I had forgotten those feelings of love I had for you.

723
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:17,400
However, the moment I heard of your passing I realized the truth.

724
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,790
I hadn't forgotten.

725
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,050
I was merely fooling myself.

726
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,720
And after I saw you alive again, I was determined.

727
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,830
I will not lose you a second time.

728
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,510
Brother-in-law...

729
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:33,760
Do you remember?

730
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,060
 Rather, let's run away.

731
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:40,150
 Let's go to a place where nobody knows us. Whether it's Ming or wherever.

732
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:43,020
 Let's run away and live together!

733
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,580
 Forgive me, Your Highness.

734
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,390
 Those words of love for me, were they all lies?

735
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:54,260
 Answer me now that you'll go with me!

736
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:02,780
 Didn't you swear upon the moon that if Father opposed our marriage,

737
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,070
  that you would run away with me?

738
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:11,180
 If you really were for me, then I'm telling you to keep your promise to me, please!

739
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,270
 Why won't you answer?

740
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,040
 At least say something!

741
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:28,720
What I couldn't tell you back then, I will tell you now.

742
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,520
I will go wherever with you. Please come with me!

743
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,720
That is already in the past.

744
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,380
I will not believe it.

745
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,490
What scares you so that you deceive me like this?

746
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:41,060
I will prove to you that I am not lying.

747
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,810
Although we were never married,

748
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:03,880
since you are so attached to our past memories, with this symbol of divorce, I now cut off our bonds.

749
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:10,170
 During the Joseon Dynasty, a sign given by the woman to a man to symbolize divorce.

750
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,080
Is it because of Ba Wu?

751
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,810
The reason you're pushing me away...

752
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:19,100
Is it because of Ba Wu?

753
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,250
Yes. That is correct.

754
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:32,960
From now on, I will be together with that man, Ba Wu.

755
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,890
My brother-in-law has left.

756
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,450
Then we should be off too. Let's go.

757
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,460
Court Lady Jo and I will not be following you.

758
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:15,620
What?

759
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,020
They may not look for me now, believing me dead.

760
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,480
We may still meet someone who knows me.

761
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,900
And if we stay together, both you and Cha Dol will continue to be in danger.

762
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,530
That's why you left me in the first place.

763
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,150
I had my reasons back then.

764
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,400
Things are better now, so don't worry.

765
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,270
No. I only thought of myself and was a great burden to you.

766
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:47,190
If you continue to be with me, you might continue to do reckless things like you did yesterday.

767
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,700
I do not want that.

768
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,310
I told you it's fine!

769
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,930
I'm not fine with it.

770
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:56,930
Don't be stubborn. Let's go together.

771
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:09,490
I mean... what if something happens to you while you're off by yourself? What will you do then?

772
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,620
I will take care of it by myself, so don't worry.

773
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,350
You always say "Don't worry, I'll take care of it".

774
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,990
What exactly shouldn't I worry about, and how will you take care of it?

775
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:18,760
You keep doing worrisome things in front of me.

776
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,390
And should someone like that look so happy when I came to rescue you?

777
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,780
Th-that was because we met on the boat. I had secretly hopedâ€”

778
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,260
Then you should've believed in me to the end!

779
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:33,070
Didn't you say this? That we should never meet again?

780
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,990
Why don't you forget things like that?

781
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,520
I told you I had my reasons!

782
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,460
You only remember such useless things like that.

783
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:48,420

784
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,480
Who wants to remember those things?

785
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:57,300
The words you say, the things you do...

786
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,630
each one of them just came to my mind.

787
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,280
What do you want me to do with that?

788
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:17,000
â™« There are still words that have been left unsaid â™«

789
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,150
â™« After a long time â™«

790
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:25,250
 Answer me. Do you want to live?

791
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,700
 Yes. I want to live.

792
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,250
 Good.

793
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,090
 Then... let's die.

794
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,900

 Bossam - Steal the Fate

796
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,800
 I want to protect you with my life. Believe me.

797
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,660
 I heard that her drawing skills are above average. This will make money.

798
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,570
 With this evidence, even his majesty, the king will have to concede.

799
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:57,050
 This is a secret. Jemulpo magistrate's personnel clerk is involved in this.

800
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,820
 I will tell you a secret you don't know.

801
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,830
 If his majesty finds out about this...

802
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,090
 I don't know if he will forgive you.

803
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,120
 Make sure to find and kill him.

804
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,740
 It looks like something is up.

805
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,380
 Don't say a word of this to the princess!

806
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,350
 They're trying to kill me to silence me.

807
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,180
 What was on it?

808
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,280
 Ba Wu, you have to leave Jemulpo.

809
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,520
