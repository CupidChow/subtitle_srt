 Jung Il-woo

00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,490
 Kwon Yu-ri

00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,220
 Shin Hyun-soo

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,930

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,080
 Bossam

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,400
 Camp of General Amin who was the  nephew of the Jurchen chief Nurhaci, founder of the Later Jin dynasty

7
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,450
Hey! Hey, Yi Dae Yeop.

8
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,180
Hey! Wake up!

9
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,940
Yi Dae Yeop!

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,970
Are you all right?

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,320
What happened?

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,610
We were captured again.

13
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,690
That's not the problem right now.

14
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,670
Those men took the secret letter that you had.

15
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,220
It looks like we will both be dead like this.

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,410
So you must never open your mouth about your father, understand?

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,660
You can use me to get yourself out of here.

18
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,440
Get a hold of yourself.

19
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,200
This... Carefully, carefully wash this. 
   - Episode 16 -

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Ah, this... scrub, scrub!

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
You have to scrub hard to wash it.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
Ah, this is underwear, so...

23
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,110
Boil those separately and then wash them.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,040
I will do it. Please move aside.

25
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,610
You, go throw this away.

26
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,970
Even if we don't tell you, you should wash this cleanly every morning.

27
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,980
What are you going to do if you glare at me? What are you going to do?

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,320
I will do it! Please go inside, hurry!

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,850
Hey! I told you to empty the chamber pot, so why do you keep meddling in our business?!

30
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,590
When you are a servant! So rude!

31
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,140
Are you all right?

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,180
She won't die!

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,610
This arrogant wench, who doesn't respect her mistress, deserves to die, but she won't die.

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,460
Just go and do the laundry!

35
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,550
Why are you doing this?

36
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,810
It doesn't matter that you are retaliating because you hate me, but what wrong has she done?

37
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,510
You didn't see? That whenever she looks at me, she glares and tries to come at me?

38
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,050
If you feel that is so unfair, instead of that concubine wench,

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,410
why don't you be the servant of a mistress like me?

40
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,840
You are acting exactly as you look.

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,170
Please stop. It's time for Mother to come back home.

42
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,350
So what if she comes back? So what if I asked a concubine wench to do the laundry?

43
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,570
What is wrong about teaching the servant bitch a lesson?

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,680
How many years did you say you were a servant?

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,320
If that's really the case, a servant is also a human being. A servant can also cry.

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,980
A servant can also wriggle if she is stepped on.

47
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,000
Shouldn't you know that better than anyone else?

48
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,990
Let's go.

49
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,490
Why are you like that?

50
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,350
Sister-in-law... about that second wife ...

51
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,370
Do you know where and how she lived?

52
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,610
Why? Are you intimidated because she's radiating elegance, unlike someone else?

53
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,850
That's... not it. Since I'm still above her, I was wondering, because I feel I should know.

54
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,550
I don't know the details either...

55
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,450
They say that she was a servant for many years at a royal clansman's house.

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,530
I'm sorry. You are always suffering because of me.

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,970
Does it compare to the suffering that you endure?

58
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,620
For crying for such trivial matters,

59
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,290
please forgive me.

60
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,230
No.

61
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,840
From now on, if you want to cry, don't hold it back and just cry.

62
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,150
If you get sick because of pent up anger, isn't that a bigger issue?

63
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,730
Don't worry about it. This doesn't faze me.

64
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,750
Then, that's fine.

65
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,600
Ah, right! Last night, I had a very unbelievable dream.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,280
You might perhaps have good news.

67
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,470
I wish your dream is correct.

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,130
Exactly what is your identity that you are wearing the Ming's military uniform

69
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,720
and possess the secret letter that the left state councillor Yi I Cheom sent to Mao Wenlong?

70
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,860
If you tell me the truth, I will spare you.

71
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,220
- I... 
 - Quiet! Don't you know that you will die if you speak?

72
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,720
I... am Joseon's left state councillor Yi I Cheom's son.

73
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,000
No! We are just temporarily appointed military officers.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,750
If this man were really Yi I Cheom's son, he'd have no reason to fight with Ming's soldiers.

75
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,130
He obtained that secret letter accidentally.

76
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,580
This man is Kim Dae Seok, whose name is written in the secret letter.

77
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,120
He has no relations with Mao Wenlong,

78
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,590
so kill me and release him.

79
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,440
Yi Dae Yeop!

80
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,220
 Release him.
(speaking Jurchen language)

81
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,830
Don't forget what I said.

82
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,630
Since you must be thirsty, drink some water first.

83
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,820
Exactly who are you?

84
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,500
My name is Kang Hong Rip.

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm the defeated commander who was captured while fighting against the Later Jin in Sarhu.

86
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,420
You've probably heard my name.

87
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,380
Lord Commander in Chief. Why are you here?

88
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,550
- Then, this place... 
 - You are right.

89
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,420
This is the camp of Amin, leader of the Later Jin  (Manchu) .

90
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,170
Seeing that you were fighting in the Ming military uniform,

91
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,860
I brought you here thinking that I might get some information.

92
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,750
But, of all things, a secret letter for Mao Wenlong had to be found in the hands of the man outside.

93
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,920
If that secret letter is delivered, Joseon and Ming will form an alliance.

94
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,850
For the Later Jin, who've been trying to keep Joseon out of this war, that should not happen.

95
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,920
Therefore, I don't know about you, but the man outside will surely die.

96
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,680
No! We must prevent it.

97
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,330
If you kill the man outside, the court officials will favor supporting the Ming Dynasty.

98
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,420
As you know, the left state councillor is a powerful man, who has a tremendous influence on political matters.

99
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,650
We must do everything to prevent that.

100
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,530
Knowing that the left state councillor sent a secret message to have you killed,

101
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,130
you still want to save his son?

102
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,150
It seems that Joseon is still agitated.

103
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,490
Even if war is staring them in the face, they are struggling for political power.

104
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,860
I am ashamed.

105
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,700
It's not something you should be ashamed of.

106
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,360
Take a rest. I will put a word with General Amin.

107
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,190
Thank you.

108
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,550
This is also not something that you should be thankful for.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,860
Whatever we do, shouldn't we at least prevent a war from happening?

110
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,230
How is it? Is the injury bearable?

111
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,460
I will do whatever it takes to save you.

112
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,180
So you ... hold tightly onto your lifeline, all right?

113
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,660
The king does not intend to interfere in the war between the Ming and Later Jin.

114
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,400
That's why he persuaded Mao Wenlong and sent him to Ga island.

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,090
If you stay encamped at the border as you are now,

116
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,590
their demand will only get stronger. It won't be of any help.

117
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,090
 (speaking Jurchen language)

118
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,670
 speaking Jurchen language

119
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,350
We don't  intend to  fight with Joseon. Instead, we only want Mao Wenlong.

120
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,960
Mao Wenlong is just all talk. He doesn't have the ability or will to fight with Later Jin.

121
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,270
If he really wanted to fight with you, then why would he have hid in Ga island?

122
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,430
Then, what is this secret letter about?

123
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,150
- That letter is evidence that Joseon doesn't want to fight with Later Jin. 
 - Explain that in detail.

124
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,400
Since our king is opposed to the idea of sending military food rations and funding to Mao Wenlong,

125
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,130
the left state councillor, the leader of those in favor of the idea, sent that secret letter.

126
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,760
Please release the left state councillor's son.

127
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,130
If you kill him, the left state councilor will have the justification to help Mao Wenlong.

128
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,990
 Speaking Jurchen language

129
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,390
Then, what will Joseon offer?

130
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,030
If I were to add to that... General Amin is the nephew of Later Jin King Nurhachi.

131
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,330
If you can persuade general Amin, you can prevent the war.

132
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,460
Since you want Mao Wenlong, I will make sure that he won't escape Ga island.

133
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,520
You shouldn't say anything that you can't be responsible for.

134
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,270
If you break the promise, you will create an even greater enmity.

135
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,790
The promise will be kept by the left state councillor, not me.

136
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,900
In return, I have a request for General Amin.

137
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,990
Get up. There you go.

138
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,040
This is Lord Commander in Chief.

139
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,810
You've been through a lot. I will excuse myself briefly.

140
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,230
What is going on? Why did they suddenly release us?

141
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,580
I played some tricks in order to survive.

142
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,870
I'm sure you don't want Joseon to become a battlefield again, either.

143
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,890
Our lives were spared thanks to you. I am grateful.

144
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,130
I will send along the promised horses and furs via the Uiju General.

145
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,990
Whether there will be another war in Joseon rests upon your shoulders.

146
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,620
- We will make sure to prevent that. 
 - I will trust you.

147
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,240
Please stay safe.

148
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,460
Thank you. Go safely.

149
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,640
What?

150
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,510
I have no idea why the barbarians sent gifts through them.
  (Both Joseon and Ming called the Later Jin barbarians)

151
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,660
I should go to the palace immediately.

152
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,560
You are here? I've heard. You've been through a lot.

153
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
We were able to return alive thanks to you, Sir.

154
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,720
You must have had many hardships due to us.

155
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,470
No. As you know, despite my appearance, I have my own know-how when it comes to protecting my own life. Go on in.

156
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,580
Is there any way to prevent Mao Wenlong from leaving Ga Island?

157
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,620
The Later Jin agreed to act as if  they were on the verge of invading Ga Island.

158
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,750
Your Majesty, please send a letter to Mao Wenlong

159
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,660
and tell him that we will persuade the Later Jin to retreat,

160
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,510
in exchange for his promise to never leave Ga Island.

161
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,890
Extracting agreements from both sides by bluffing?

162
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,350
Although we may take care of Mao Wenlong that way,

163
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,350
would Amin really order his troops to retreat as agreed?

164
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,040
The Later Jin army does not have the ability to cross the ocean to attack Ga Island.

165
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,440
They struggled against Mao Wenlong's army,

166
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,720
so they don't have anything to gain by breaking the agreement they make with Joseon.

167
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,210
What you said is true.

168
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,440
I pushed you into a deadly situation to die, and you've returned after having accomplished a great deed for our country.

169
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,230
What award would be suitable for him?

170
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,820
Since it's an accomplishment that we cannot make public,

171
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,010
I believe that a material reward would be appropriate.

172
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,710
Do that.

173
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,860
Your Majesty, the left state councillor is here.

175
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,950
Ask him in.

176
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,560
Your Majesty, Kim Dae Seok and Yi Dae Yeop

177
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,650
must immediately be returned to Mao Wenlong.

178
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,490
That is impossible.

179
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,930
Your Majesty, if only just to extract military provisions from Joseon,

180
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,540
he is sure to report to the emperor what these two men did.

181
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,700
If so, the Ming Empire

182
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,450
is sure to make greater demands of Joseon.

183
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,860
Please heed my words.

184
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,060
I intended to do just that, but something happened, and I can no longer do it.

185
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,940
I never even suspected that you were communicating with Amin of the Later Jin.

186
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,460
What are you saying?

187
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,770
Amin had these two bring me this letter.

188
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,720
Please read it.

189
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,330
 Addressed to Joseon's left state councillor.

190
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,850
 I received the letter you sent.

191
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,130
  As you proposed, if you prevent Mao Wenlong from leaving Ga Island,

192
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,570
 I will command my troops to retreat.

193
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,760
 However, if in the future,

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,930
 you break your promise to not help the Ming Empire,

195
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,600
 that will only mean war. Please heed my words.

196
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,540
So how long have you been communicating with the barbarians?

197
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,460
I have been slandered.

198
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,060
I have never communicated with the barbarians.

199
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,520
I am not blaming you. I intend to praise you.

200
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,890
Your Majesty, I will swear upon the Heavens—

201
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,160
You deny it, but there is such clear evidence.

202
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,820
So I'm not sure that the public will believe you.

203
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,440
As for Mao Wenlong, you could give him military provisions or persuade him to stay,

204
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,330
you can take care of him however you want to, I suppose.

205
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,070
I apologize, Father.

206
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,560
I suppose these are all your tricks?

207
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,660
I already told you, my main talent is not tricks.

208
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,450
You know that tiger-hunting soldier who shot me with a rifle?

209
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,400
He asked me to send you his regards.

210
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,700
So you really want to die, don't you?

211
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,460
It appears that everything worked out well, so I don't know why you are so angry, Your Excellency.

212
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,100
You weren't really hoping that your son would die on the northern frontier, were you?

213
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,240
Didn't Westerners always want to fight barbarians by helping the Ming Empire?

214
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,130
Why did you change your mind now?

215
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,700
We can't fight the Later Jin now, not in Joseon's current condition.

216
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,670
I'm not saying that we should never fight them, but to live and fight them in the future.

217
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:22,490
Is that just your intention? Or the intentions of all Westerners?

218
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,270
Not all Westerners think the same way.

219
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,490
Are all Westerners aware of your differing thoughts, I wonder?

220
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,170
Isn't it the harmful consequence of the political factions

221
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,840
that everyone speaks in a single voice, parroting the leader?

222
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,270
Of course, since you are a leader,

223
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,560
such harm would be of benefit to you.

224
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,930
Follow me.

225
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,630
I can't be sure he will be all right.

226
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,390
Are you leaving the royal court now?

227
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes.

228
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,050
Do you have something to say to me?

229
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,050
His Majesty is looking for you.

230
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,590
Weren't you resentful?

231
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,780
Since you are not responding, it appears that you are resentful.

232
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,180
No, Your Majesty.

233
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,690
Are you truly not resentful? Or if not ...

234
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,600
Maybe because I'm a king who abandoned his own daughter, the princess,

235
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,240
perhaps you suspected that I would naturally abandon you anyway, so it's useless to be resentful?

236
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,050
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

237
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,320
Is Kang Hong Rip doing well?

238
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,110
Yes, he is safe due to your concern, Your Majesty.

239
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm sure he looks that way on the outside.

240
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,320
It's been over four years since he was taken prisoner by the Later Jin.

241
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,180
He doesn't even know when he might be released

242
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,220
so his heart must have rotted into a black lump.

243
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,850
If he had obeyed my command and died while fighting until the end without surrendering,

244
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,790
then he would have been hailed as a hero and brought honor to his family name, instead of being scorned as he is now.

245
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,300
I had no choice but to send my right-hand men to their deaths.

246
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,500
That is what it means to be a king.

247
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,260
What would you have done?

248
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,520
Will you not respond to this question, as well?

249
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,160
I won't blame you, no matter what you say.

250
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,320
So respond.

251
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Your Majesty,

252
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,970
I am a small-minded man,

253
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,870
so rather than the stability of the country, or the greater cause,

254
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,490
what is most precious to me

255
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,800
is what is mine, my people.

256
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,270
If I can't even protect my own family,

257
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,180
what use would I be as a king?

258
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,800
If it were me,

259
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,850
I think I would immediately give my throne to the person I hate most,

260
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,320
and run away.

261
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,660
Why would you give it to the person you hate most, of all people?

262
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,000
You want to give an extra piece of rice cake to the person you hate?

263
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,070
Why would I do that?

264
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,850
To give rice cake to someone you hate means you want him to choke on it and die.

265
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,090
But rather than that,

266
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,790
"Why don't you get screwed, too?"

267
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,510
That's what I would mean.

268
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,780
He should live a long life,

269
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,270
and experience getting screwed, too, shouldn't he?

270
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,540
What is so great about being a king?

271
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,760
You have to wake up at dawn and greet Queen Dowager,

272
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,680
attend the meeting in the morning, take daily lessons, and have discussions with the officials...

273
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,960
and unable to rest until late into the night.

274
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,100
Trapped in this palace for your whole life

275
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,810
unable to see the sights outside,

276
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,170
and at all hours of the day, you hear

277
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,580
"You can't do that," or "Please heed my words."

278
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,520
Don't do this, don't do that. Ugh.

279
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,600
Your vassals will pester you all day.

280
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,910
Yes, that's right.

281
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,120
And if anything happens to the country,

282
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,390
it's the king's fault, isn't it?

283
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,880
If it rains too much, it's the king's fault.

284
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,220
If there is drought, that's the king's fault, too.

285
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,560
Earthquake, it's the king's fault.

286
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,030
To make matters worse,

287
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,960
It's the king's fault that old bachelors and maids can't marry. Bullshit!

288
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,610
They are so full of bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullsh—

289
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,710
I am terribly sorry, Your Majesty.

290
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,050
No, it's fine. Yes, it's all bullshit, isn't it?

291
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,570
Bullshit is right. It is such bullshit.

292
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,030
Here.

293
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,820
Thank you.

294
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,340
How did Kim Dae Seok return alive?

295
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,190
I told you that it was your last chance to live as my son.

296
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,560
- Do you remember that?
 - Yes.

297
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,690
And yet you disobeyed my command

298
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,920
and collaborated to have your father insulted. Why?

299
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,780
Won't you properly answer right now?

300
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,570
Because the king is correct, and you are not, Father.

301
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,220
What did you say? How dare you?

302
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,420
Keep talking.

303
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,120
The Ming Dynasty is the setting sun, and Later Jin is the rising sun.

304
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,690
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

305
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,460
They are not the barbarians of the past who used to only pillage.

306
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,530
Your eyes must be blinded, too.

307
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,920
How can you compare barbarians to the Ming Empire?

308
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,220
Don't look down on them for being barbarians.

309
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,090
Think about what happened to our Goryeo Dynasty.

310
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,980
They only looked to the Song Empire. Then what did the Yuan Empire do to them?

311
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,410
Goryeo is different from Joseon.

312
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,340
How are they different?

313
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,260
They looked down on Japan

314
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,280
and ended up enduring seven years of war.

315
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,230
This boy...

316
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,540
Serving Ming and being on equal footing with Later Jin and Japan is Joseon's national policy.

317
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,990
As a Confucianist,

318
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,440
how can I agree on joining hands with barbarians and go against the formidable Ming Empire?

319
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,190
I don't mean that we should fight the Ming Empire,

320
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,070
but that we should stay neutral.

321
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,180
It is said, "If you know your enemy and yourself, you can win every battle."

322
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,750
As we saw in the battle of Sarhū

323
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,030
the Later Jin is already strong, and Joseon is weak.

324
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,950
Now is not the time to fight the Later Jin,

325
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,960
but the time for us to help each other, Father.

326
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,470
So after we just look back-and-forth like a bat,

327
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,350
what if the barbarians fail? Will the Ming Empire stand for it?

328
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,410
The Ming Empire that you serve so faithfully

329
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,400
is on the verge of collapsing with illness.

330
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,590
The emperor is immersed in nothing but carpentry, after entrusting everything to the head eunuch Wei Zhongxian.

331
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,320
The Ming Empire is in shambles due to Wei Zhongxian's abuse of power.

332
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,600
You know that better than anyone, Father.

333
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,120
If I had delivered that letter as you commanded,

334
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,510
it is obvious that we would be at war with the Later Jin.

335
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,880
So how could I deliver that letter?

336
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,500
And as for Kim Dae Seok,

337
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,810
I determined that he is someone we can kill later.

338
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,490
What a great excuse.

339
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,390
Then what about Amin's letter? Why did you just stand by and watch?

340
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,380
I was not aware of what was going on with Amin.

341
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,950
So I could not prevent it.

342
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,010
Please don't believe him. Everything he says is a lie.

343
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,840
How is your health?

344
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,940
It has improved a lot.

345
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,780
You may leave now. Rest and recuperate.

346
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,070
Yes, sir.

347
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,860
Father.

348
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,310
You don't believe him by any chance, do you?

349
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,330
They are all lies. You should scold and ask him immediately—

350
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,530
Be quiet. Are you really not aware that he is still useful?

351
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,480
Go and call the doctor.

352
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,960
Yes.

353
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,900
Take him and put him to bed.

354
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,830
He rode here on a horse all day long,

355
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,610
so he must've been like this due to fatigue, Your Majesty.

356
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,030
So you must like him.

357
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,750
That's not it...

358
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,420
It's fine. Go ahead and take him.

359
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

360
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,880
He worked hard,

361
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,480
so allow him to rest for a few days.

362
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,430
Time to wake!

363
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,750
Do you think this is your home?

364
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,090
The sun is in the middle of the sky already.

365
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,360
Where am I?

366
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,760
 It's the king's fault that old bachelors and maids can't marry. Bullshit!

367
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,380
 They are so full of bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullsh—

368
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,750
Are you brave or ignorant?

369
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,770
I am very sorry.

370
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,230
In any case, it's good that you've returned safely.

371
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,820
Rest well until you are summoned.

372
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,380
Cha Dol!

373
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,970
Your father is home!

374
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,580
Mother!

375
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,940
My Lord!

376
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,020
Long time no see, Yeo Ju Daek.

377
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,560
You are home.

378
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,160
Why the long face?

379
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,080
Is there something wrong?

380
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,130
Where is she? Did she leave with Mother?

381
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,290
No, she's in the room.

382
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,270
Not that room...

383
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,700
She's in my room.

384
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,720
Why would she be there?

385
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,290
 Can I come in for a minute?

386
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,550
Yes, you can.

387
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,210
I...

388
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,630
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,180
You look exhausted.

390
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,100
It must have been a tough journey.

391
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,270
No, it wasn't.

392
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
Thank you.

393
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,890
For keeping your promise to come back alive.

394
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,000
Thanks to you.

395
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,740
Because of you,

396
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,410
I was able to come back alive.

397
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,750
Get up.

398
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,980
My husband!

399
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,870
Who's your husband?

400
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,350
Where do you think you are? Won't you get up?

401
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,860
Sit down. Sit first and talk.

402
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,310
It's been a while since we last saw each other..

403
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,910
How dare you appear in my sight?

404
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,110
- You're a nobleman now. You should act like one—
- Get up!

405
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,500
Let go. Let me go! I don't want to leave.

406
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,320
No! I can't leave!

407
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,450
- Stop him, would you?
- Get out.

408
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,070
Help me, the second wife!

409
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,780
What has she done to deserve our help?

410
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,720
But we need to think about Cha Dol...

411
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
What shall we do?

412
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,440
I can't do anything when he's already is out of his mind.

413
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,130
I guess the heavens are not indifferent after all.

414
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,590
What shall we do?

415
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,100
Let this go first! Otherwise, I'm going to tell them everything!

416
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,250
Tell what?

417
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,240
You think I don't know?

418
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,460
That woman... is the princess.

419
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,700
What did you just say?

420
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,230
The princess. The king's daughter.

421
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,830
Are you crazy? What's that bullshit about?

422
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,960
Let this go first. If you don't, I'm going to scream.

423
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,300
That the princess is hiding in this house.

424
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,930
What are you doing?

425
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,430
Oh, my. Oh, dear.

426
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,820
Why is she back?

427
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,890
That room, that room.

428
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,200
- My son, you are home.
 - Brother!

429
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,820
I'm home.

430
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,230
Good. You must have gone through a lot.

431
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,720
Are you well?

432
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,230
Yes, I am.

433
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,810
Let's go inside.

434
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,880
What are you doing? Come in.

435
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,150
Has he found out?

436
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,380
Yes.

437
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,950
What Chun Bae told you is true.

438
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,720
But I still wanted to not believe that. How could she?

439
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,500
Why did you hide that from me?

440
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,950
If you find out, I thought you'd be worried.

441
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,250
That's why I couldn't tell you.

442
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,450
Well ... Even for me it's so absurd.

443
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,470
It must have been worse for you.

444
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,660
However... What's done is done. We should forget the past.

445
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,580
What can we do? We should forget everything and—

446
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,550
I can't do that.

447
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,990
Do you really believe that... that woman came back because she missed Cha Dol?

448
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,840
No. She's a woman that doesn't care about her child.

449
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,680
You must be right.

450
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,440
However ... The situation has changed a lot, right?

451
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,860
Your status has been restored and you are working as a royal official.

452
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,060
There is me and Yeon Ok—

453
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,680
Mother!

454
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm doing this for Cha Dol.

455
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,140
 If Cha Dol's mother hadn't been a low commoner, I would've already kicked that terrible wench out.

456
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,450
 But if we were to raise Cha Dol as her son,

457
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,690
 Cha Dol would become a commoner himself, who cannot take the state exam to become a court official.

458
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,300
 We don't have a choice.

459
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,630
I cannot do that.

460
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,950
My son, do you have to go that way and make Cha Dol a commoner's child?

461
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,210
I'm sorry. Please consider Cha Dol's birth mother as a dead person—

462
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,500
I cannot do that either.

463
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,460
For Cha Dol's sake, I absolutely need a daughter-in-law from a noble family.

464
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,850
Keep that in mind. You can leave now.

465
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,230
Mother!

466
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:57,010
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind. Leave now.

467
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,220
She's from a noble family.

468
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,780
No. She's from a royal family.

469
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,120
She's a princess.

470
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,810
Who is?

471
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,120
Cha Dol's mom is?

472
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,940
Yes.

473
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,850
The daughter of this country's king.

474
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,040
She's a princess.

475
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,580
Oh, my!

476
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,320
What should we do?

477
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,800
Sister-in-law.

478
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,470
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

479
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,200
No. It's not that. Never mind.

480
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,450
R-Restroom ...

481
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,800
So ...

482
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,720
The king's daughter ... The princess ... You brought her in bossam?

483
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,190
Yes.

484
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,020
Cha Dol's mother ...

485
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,130
No.

486
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,350
Kick the princess out, too, immediately.

487
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,210
Mother!

488
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,830
The left state councillor must be looking for her with all his might.

489
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,750
Don't you know that our entire family can get into trouble?

490
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,640
The left state councillor doesn't know that the princess is alive.

491
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,910
There is no such secret that's buried forever.

492
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,470
On top of that, we're talking about the left state councillor.

493
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,460
How long do you think you can keep this away from that man?

494
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,850
Of course, we cannot live like this forever.

495
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,450
And I don't plan to do that either.

496
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,180
Have you already forgotten

497
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,310
why our family fell down overnight and who made it so?

498
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,650
Kick out Cha Dol's mother and the princess immediately.

499
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,710
That's the only way for our family to live.

500
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,140
Left state councillor or whatnot. I'm going to protect my family so no one can meddle.

501
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,610
Please trust me!

502
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,010
The left state councillor ... is a devil.

503
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,090
How could a human being stop a devil?

504
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,200
Cutting the connection with the princess ...

505
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,610
That's the only way to avoid that man.

506
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:21,100
Kicking out the princess from this household is the same as putting her on a deathbed.

507
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,720
I feel bad for her, but we cannot die with her.

508
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,840
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,370
What are you sorry for? Do you mean you'd die with her?

510
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,250
You don't care if your mother and sister die? You only need the princess?

511
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,050
I...

512
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,240
I love her.

513
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,000
I sincerely ... love her with all my heart.

514
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,480
What happened? What did Mother say?

515
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,750
Brother. You know that I'm on the princess's side, right?

516
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,690
Watch your mouth.

517
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,000
It was a sudden death? The left state councillor's second son?

518
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes.

519
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,130
When it's the father that deserves punishment,

520
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,220
I guess the child got it instead.

521
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:38,600
That made the innocent princess a virgin widow.

522
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,110
A virgin widow...

523
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,020
The most pitiful widow out of all widows...

524
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,140
So, she was an unmarried widow.

525
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,850
An unmarried widow?

526
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,250
Your groom-to-be dies after you are engaged, but before the actual wedding.

527
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,560
That's what you call them.

528
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,700
I see. A widow who has never been married...

529
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,840
So, she was the left state councillor's daughter-in-law, but

530
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,100
she was their daughter-in-law only in name.

531
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,020
Since they were engaged, she believed she was already their daughter-in-law.

532
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,090
That's why she thought she had to live in that house.

533
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,070
But still, I heard that

534
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,040
the princesses live at a place called Princess Place.

535
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,970
Why would she choose to live a hard life in the parents-in-law's house?

536
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:31,030
Are you saying that was Cha Dol's mother's decision?

537
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,620
Yes.

538
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,950
But still, there is no way that she wanted to do that on her own.

539
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,640
I guess she was pushed this and that way to do so.

540
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,790
No, she wasn't.

541
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:47,220
The princess made that decision herself.

542
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:53,130
She wanted to fulfill the filial duty on behalf of her late fiancé.

543
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,750
Her natural inclination is to put the well-being of others

544
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,640
before her own well-being.

545
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,190
You've seen it too, so you understand, right?

546
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,060
You called everyone in one at a time. Did you find out what you wanted?

547
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,050
But ... you are in trouble, right?

548
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,200
- What trouble?
 - What do you mean what?

549
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,530
You've treated her with much disdain all this time because she was a lowly commoner.

550
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,380
When did I?

551
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,360
Put your hand on your heart and reflect.

552
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,890
Whether you've been treating her well or looked down on her.

553
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:38,290
I might have given her a little hard time initially. Just a little bit.

554
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,490
But I ended up treating her well, didn't I?

555
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,270
How did you treat her well? I don't remember anything.

556
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,980
- You tell me!
 - Quiet!

557
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,690
By the way, what are you going to do with Cha Dol's mother?

558
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,240
When the princess is the wife, we cannot keep the concubine, can we?

559
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,840
I told your brother to make a decision.

560
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,470
Really?

561
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,590
Then, he'll kick her out.

562
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,010
- I told you to leave.
 - I can't leave.

563
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,140
Cha Dol's my son. It's my son's house. Why would I leave?

564
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,680
You abandoned him, remember? Who are you to call him your son now?

565
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,760
- If you mention Cha Dol one more time—
 - What about you?

566
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,330
You can step aside, my son. I will take care of it.

567
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,610
Mother-in-law.

568
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,230
Mother-in-law. I did wrong.

569
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,170
Please forgive me once.

570
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,240
I was wrong.

571
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,120
I've reflected on my past a lot.

572
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,510
For Cha Dol's sake, please forgive me, Cha Dol's father. Please, my husband..

573
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:46,170
I will do everything you tell me to do. I'm so sorry.

574
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,010
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

575
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,360
Shut your mouth and stay quiet.

576
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,130
- If you do something foolish—
 - I won't!

577
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,880
I won't do anything. Don't worry.

578
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,450
You should kick her out. Why would you keep her in there?

579
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,350
What if she opens her mouth carelessly?

580
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,240
Let her be. Cha Dol's birth mother is nothing.

581
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,710
She knows about the princess.

582
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,480
Wait, how did she find out?

583
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,390
I guess she overheard what you and Yeo Ju Daek were talking about. There is no other way.

584
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,560
- I tried to be as careful as possible.
- Anyway, that's why I'm keeping her there,

585
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,430
so, keep your eyes on her. She might flee anytime.

586
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,200
Don't worry. If she tries to pull something funny, I will ...

587
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,380
I'm back from school!

588
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,030
Cha Dol!

589
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,950
Father!

590
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,350
Let me take a good look at you, my son.

591
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,140
Have you been well?

592
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,320
No, I haven't been well.

593
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,930
How come?

594
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,330
Haven't you heard?

595
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,030
I brought taffy that you like.

596
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,120
You said taffy is the tastiest thing in the world.

597
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,880
Didn't you? Was that a lie?

598
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,960
Well, then. I will give it to Chun Bae.

599
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,790
Cha Dol.

600
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,430
Should we sleep in my room together tonight?

601
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,910
- For real?
- Yes.

602
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,930
Father.

603
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,980
Are you happy that you are a nobleman now?

604
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,530
You are not?

605
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,840
No, I don't know what's so good about it.

606
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,710
Why not? You are wearing nice clothes and living in a big house like this.

607
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,910
What good is a big house? I'm always sleeping alone by myself.

608
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,150
What? You don't like sleeping by yourself?

609
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,580
No. I like the old times.

610
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,820
Sleeping with you and Mom.

611
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,820
Are you a kid?

612
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,820
Am I an adult then? I don't even get to see you often these days.

613
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,920
You are always busy.

614
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,420
I'm sorry.

615
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,580
Let's see each other every day from now. Sounds good?

616
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,530
Good.

617
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,450
Father.

618
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,910
What now?

619
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,360
Never mind.

620
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,760
Go on.

621
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,000
I said, never mind.

622
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,390
You want to talk about your mother, right?

623
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,730
It's fine. If you don't want to talk about it, we don't have to.

624
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,440
Do you want to live with your mother?

625
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,880
No.

626
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,680
- No? 
- Right, no.

627
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,570
I told you already. I said I like the old times.

628
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,080
Cha Dol.

629
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,790
What?

630
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,670
Then, we can live like the old times!

631
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,160
- Why?
 - Stop!

632
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,830
Father! Stop!

633
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,950
Mother-in-law, did you sleep well last night?

634
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:20,060
She asked you whether you had a good sleep. Why aren't you saying anything?

635
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,880
Gosh, how should I address her?

636
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,890
Her Highness? Or just Daughter-in-law?

637
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,040
She can hear everything too.

638
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,180
W-Well ...

639
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,600
I wish you'd treat me as a daughter-in-law just as you have been doing until now.

640
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,060
If that's all right with you.

641
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,780
Of course, it's all right with me.

642
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,580
Sure! Let's do that then.

643
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,440
Thank you.

644
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,540
There's no need.

645
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,310
Should I bring water to wash your face?

646
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,600
Why don't you go get it?

647
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,810
No. I will be back soon.

648
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,600
Wait, is there anything you need?

649
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,870
The peddler woman will be dropping by today.

650
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,010
- Watch your mouth.
- Yes, sir.

651
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,260
I guess you've planted her into Kim Dae Seok's house.

652
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,660
Did she get valuable information?

653
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,520
It's not a big deal.

654
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,720
I should ask her myself.

655
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,600
Kim Dae Seok's wife, who had fled a long time ago, is back.

656
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,890
I'm here to see Kim Dae Seok. Please announce me.

657
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,450
If you mention the name Yi Dae Yeop, he will know.

658
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,210
A man named Yi Dae Yeop came to visit.

659
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,650
Did you just say Yi Dae Yeop?

660
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,360
Yes.

661
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,990
Young Master!

662
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,820
How did you come this far ...?

663
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,420
I just stopped by on my way.

664
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,720
Are you in your right mind?

665
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,720
How could you let Brother-in-law in?

666
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,850
I'm sorry.

667
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:11,120
I couldn't allow him to be turned back at the front door.

668
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,920
If he has endured the necessary risks in order to see you, don't you think he has a good enough reason?

669
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,530
Please meet him for a brief moment.

670
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,250
Have you been healthy and comfortable thus far?

671
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,400
Your Highness...

672
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,510
Go inside.

673
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,150
Are you going through hardships because of that woman?

674
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,220
There are a lot of watching eyes.

675
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,550
Quickly tell me the reason you came to visit.

676
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,330
If you don't have anything else to say, I will...

677
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,460
Don't forget that ... I'm here.

678
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,410
If you're having a hard time, please let me know whenever.

679
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,740
I am doing well.

680
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,070
Until when are you going to just endure everything?

681
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,420
Why are you being treated like this?

682
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,060
If you just say a word, I will immediately ...

683
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,570
I don't know what you heard to be acting like this.

684
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,990
But, as I have told you, I am doing well.

685
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,380
I understand.

686
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,490
Whenever you need me, please come find me.

687
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,800
Please stay healthy and comfortable.

688
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,140
Why would that rascal young master come here? Why?

689
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,460
What do you think? He must have heard about Cha Dol's birth  mother.

690
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,820
He probably came because he was worried about her highness the princess.

691
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,280
Who is he to be worrying about her? Who is he?  (using low speech form for "he")

692
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,560
"He"? Is the young master your friend or what?

693
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,020
You are more of a problem than the young master, Court Lady Jo.

694
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,050
You know he's the enemy's son. You still let him in?

695
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,450
Watch your language!

696
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,380
That peddler could be sent by the left state councillor.

697
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,970
And now his son! Get your wits about you!

698
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:43,430
The left state councillor might find out that the princess is alive because of you!

699
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:48,300
The young master was going to betray his own family for the princess.

700
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,260
He's not to blame.

701
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,580
Of course, he's to blame!

702
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,050
When Chil Sung died, he grabbed Ba Wu by his collar to protect his older brother.

703
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,110
Anyway, like father like son.

704
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,860
I must be crazy.

705
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,950
When the young master wanted to flee with the princess, I should've helped him.

706
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,640
Somehow she got stuck with another guy and is being treated as a concubine in a house like this.

707
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,170
She got stuck? Who is holding her down?

708
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,460
He's the one who made moves on his sister-in-law!

709
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,590
What? That's still out of line considering you're not educated!

710
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,770
How could you let such filthy things out of your mouth!

711
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,240
Filth... Yes, I am dirty!

712
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,440
So, you tried to hook him up with his sister-in-law with that pure mind of yours?

713
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,470
If I interact with you again, I will change my surname.

714
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,480
My surname!

715
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,210
That woman!

716
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,420
 That peddler could be sent by the left state councillor.

717
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,140
 And now it's his son? Get your wits about you!

718
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,950
 The left state councillor might find out the princess is alive because of you!

719
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,550
Mother!

720
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,870
Sir Monk is here.

721
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,650
Sir Monk.

722
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,350
Have you been well so far?

723
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,960
Please come inside.

724
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:21,040
There are obstacles after obstacles. There is no easy day, is there?

725
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,640
We cannot even kick her out because she might talk about the princess.

726
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,360
But we cannot live with her.

727
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,460
What should we do, Sir Monk?

728
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,640
Why don't you leave her in my hands?

729
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,120
Excuse me? In your hands?

730
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,190
I will take her with me and enlighten her.

731
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,960
 That's a good idea!

732
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,690
 But would you be all right, Sir Monk?

733
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,560
You won't be able to keep your eyes on her all day long. Wouldn't she escape?

734
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,530
Don't worry, Madam.

735
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:05,890
If I make her do the wall-facing mind training in a cave for a couple of years, she will become a human.

736
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,380
If that doesn't work, I can shave her head and make her a nun.

737
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,900
Hu Nam, you are so dead.

738
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,150
It will lift the weight off of my sister-in-law's shoulders!

739
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,550
What is this?

740
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,540
Damn it.

741
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,110
Did you find her?

742
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,470
I can't find her.

743
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:32,190
Brother! Brother!

744
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,440
It's an emergency!

745
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,420
Our land property document and jewels are all gone.

746
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,990
This wench. Where could we find her?

747
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,410
Since you have to go to the palace, you can go ahead now.

748
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,030
I will take care of the rest.

749
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,400
Sir.

750
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,690
If we lure that ex-wife of Kim Dae Seok, we might be able to find something.

751
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,160
Please allow me some more time.

752
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,760
Dig deeper.

753
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,400
Yes, sir.

754
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,380
Wait!

755
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,020
Is this his excellency the left state councillor's house?

756
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,960
The princess is alive, you said?

757
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,090
Yes.

758
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,500
You must know well if you spoke a lie.

759
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,930
You will know if you go there right now.

760
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,420
Where is she right now?

761
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,970
Pay me first.

762
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,600
Where is she?

763
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,820
In Ba Wu's ... I mean Kim Dae Seok's house.

764
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,020
I'll leave now.

765
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,880
She has a big mouth. Take care of her.

766
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,310
P-Please spare my life, Your Excellency!.

767
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,760
Please spare me!

768
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,160
Spare me! I didn't do anything wrong!

769
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,630
Your Excellency!

770
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,520
Your Excellency! Spare me!

771
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,410
I didn't do anything wrong!

772
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,630
Spare my life!

773
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,390
It's been a mystery why Dae Yeop would take his side all this time.

774
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,950
It's all because of the princess.

775
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:49,250
Go to the palace now and bring the palace guard commandant Seok Gye.

776
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,720
Why Seok Gye?

777
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,010
Don't you know that the palace guards are guarding that scoundrel's house?!

778
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:59,330
I didn't think that far.

779
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,840
But what about Dae Yeop?

780
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,420
Let me go!

781
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,950
Spare me!

782
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,440
Let me go.

783
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,810
Let me go.

784
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,760
Who is that woman?

785
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,240
She's no one. Don't mind her.

786
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,050
Save me, Lord.

787
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,730
I only told them the princess is alive. That's all.

788
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,860
- Spare me, please. 
 - Quiet!

789
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,450
Does Father know this as well?

790
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,370
You should give up.

791
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,790
Step aside.

792
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,870
The princess is in Kim Dae Seok's house.

793
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,540
His excellency the left state councillor is looking for you. Quickly get ready.

794
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,140
Yes, sir.

795
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:17,460
The chief of police met up with the palace guard chief and they left the palace together?

796
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,610
Yes, Your Ladyship.

797
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,030
Have you been well?

798
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,950
Your Excellency.

799
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:32,490

800
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,590
 Thank you.

801
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,260
 For keeping your promise to come back alive.

 Bossam - Steal the Fate 
 Preview

804
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,700
 Proceed according to the plan.

805
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:55,050
 The present king is a criminal who collaborated with palace maiden Kim to poison and murder the late king.

806
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:58,690
 Why don't you stand on my side?

807
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:04,530
 Let's dethrone the injudicious king, and let's properly build up the royalty and the country with our own hands.

808
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,450
 Make sure you protect Hwa In.

809
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,830
 Please give me your permission to get married with Kim Dae Seok.

810
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:11,660
 I don't approve. Get ready to leave with me.

811
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,560
 After taking care of the left state councillor, what do you think his majesty would do with the princess?

812
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,410
 Could you kill the princess by tonight?

813
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,050
 I will go personally.

814
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:23,480
 He betrayed our family. We should kill him!

815
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,710
♫  The stone rolls on  ♫

816
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,980
♫  Where will I go tomorrow?  ♫
