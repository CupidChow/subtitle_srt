00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,500
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,570
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,120
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,990

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,010
 Bossam

6
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,540
 Episode 10

7
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,870
Are they Kim Dae Seok's mother and sister?

8
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,550
Yes.

9
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,680
Drag them along.

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,130
- Oh. 
 - Mother!

11
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,810
- Unbind them.
 - Yes.

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,600
Why? Are you unhappy with letting someone else stay in your sister-in-law's room?

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,050
No, it's not that.

14
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,250
This is already a place he's come and gone from, so that's what bothered me.

15
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,900
Don't worry.

16
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,020
There's no way that he would know that his mother and sister

17
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,190
are hidden in the princess' room.

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,890
How are you?

19
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,870
I'm all right so you can stop now and rest.

20
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,590
How can I rest when I'm so afraid?

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,490
You said this house belongs to the enemy who killed my father and grandfather.

22
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,950
I told you to be careful in what you say.

23
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,930
You said you saw my brother.

24
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,970
I told you not to speak of your brother, no matter what.

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,650
- Have you been to the physician? 
 - Well, do you think I'd die?

26
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,050
What are you so curious of that you've come now?

27
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,650
Do you really need to dig to the end of it?

28
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,390
This is something really dangerous.

29
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,520
They won't leave me alone.

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,130
You have something going on.

31
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,230
Hyeong-nim, tell me anything you know.

32
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,930
It's something to do with people who are precious to me.

33
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,580
I don't like you that much but

34
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,950
I'll beg you.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,550
It's floating. It's floating.

36
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,290
You're doing well.

37
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,450
I wish I could fly a kite with no worries too.

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,240
I like this.

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,190
Man, it's almost time.

40
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,320
Court Lady Jo... Are you almost done?

41
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,920
Why is there no answer?

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,360
Are you kidding? Who would pay for this, you idiot!

43
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,730
Brother, if you just give me a little time...

44
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,420
I did give you time. I gave you time!

45
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,290
Even though I gave it to you, you brought me this kind of trash!

46
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,450
You call this erotica? What kind of erotica has everyone completely clothed?

47
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,370
Hyeong-nim, do they have to take their clothes off every time?

48
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,010
There's fun in just imagining what's under their clothes too.

49
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,650
You imagine all you like by yourself.

50
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,930
- Hyeong-nim. 
 - Let go, you good-for-nothing!

51
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,580
You go there right now

52
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,470
and bring me a properly drawn piece, or follow me to the government office.

53
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,680
Choose one of the two. What do you want to do?

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,790
Hyeong-nim, why do you keep speaking of the government office?

55
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,430
You find my words funny, huh? You wait right here.

56
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,520
- I'll go report this to the government office right away and return. 
 - Hyeong-nim.

57
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,200
Let go, you jackass!

58
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,320
- Oh, Hyeong-nim.  
 - Let go!

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,420
Oh my word! As it is, there's nothing good to look at on that face,

60
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,160
what do we do about your swollen eyes?

61
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,330
It's nothing to speak of.

63
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,260
I haven't seen Cha Dol's father for a few days now.

64
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,190
The thing is, he's going around trying to find a way to repay his debt.

65
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,560
- It's not even a small sum. 
 - You don't think he's going to try to steal something again, do you?

66
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,290
- No, he won't ever do that. 
 - Are you sure?

67
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,540
It's for sure. You said Ba Wu promised he wouldn't steal anymore.

68
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,930
I don't know about anything else but he's a man of his word, so don't worry.

69
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,360
Fine if he's not, why are you getting so angry?

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,610
It's because my eye hurts so much. My eye!

71
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,700
If you see Cha Dol's father, tell him that family is not only people who eat together

72
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,900
but people who put their strength together when times are hard.

73
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,980
If he thinks of us as family,  he shouldn't work so hard by himself

74
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,260
but let us worry about it together. Please tell him that.

75
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,480
Yes, I will tell him.

76
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,090
W-w-who are you?

77
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,740
If you know anything about smuggling ships loaded with sulfur and copper, confess everything,

78
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,270
Who sent you?

79
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,970
Left State Councillor Yi I Cheom.  Because I am well aware that he is your powerful backer,

80
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,060
it would be good for you to not say useless things.

81
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,390
You know that and you're still trying to threaten me right now?

82
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,490
Is that all you have to say?

83
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,220
I'm just someone who turns a blind eye to

84
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,680
and cleans up after the smuggling. I don't know anything.

85
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,940
You don't know anything.

86
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,490
- If you don't know anything you must die.  
 - I've thought of it. I've thought of something.

87
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,790
You'd better have thought of something properly.

88
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,760
I heard that a very important person will come from Ming

89
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,050
on the 15th of this month.

90
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,630
The land of Ming. 
   (China during the Ming Dynasty)

91
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you all aware that this time His Excellency Wei Zhongxian's man is coming from Ming?

92
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,630
- Yes, Father. 
 - Yes, My Lord.

93
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,720
We must make sure to win him over to our side.

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,470
Then, it will be easy to convince Head Eunuch Wei.

95
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,930
You make sure to give him a lot of whatever he wants, whether riches or women.

96
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,830
Yes.

97
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,460
What happened with the search for Kim Je Nam's grandson?

98
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,930
From the market street to Cheonggye creek and Paju,

99
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,760
I looked everywhere he might be, but there's no trace of him.

100
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,430
I think he may have fled to the countryside.

101
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,890
Circulate his likeness to each government office and announce that he is wanted.

102
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,970
Since he was bold enough to kidnap the princess,

103
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,660
I don't know when he may next stab us in the back.

104
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,230
We have to find him first.

105
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,690
What about Cha Dol's father?

106
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,090
He seemed to be unsettled all night. He finally just managed to fall asleep.

107
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,970
Excuse me.  I think every drawing except this one

108
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,120
is going to be rejected because they are fully dressed.

109
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,870
Can't you just take off their clothes a little bit more?

110
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,860
This is the best I can do.

111
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,830
There is this as well.

112
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,680
I transferred the stories that were being told by the court ladies into writing.

113
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
I can guarantee that it's entertaining.

114
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,800
Well, you have to know what is written to feel it is entertaining.

115
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,410
If you are just going to expose half of the body...

116
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,240
There you go again!

117
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,470
- It hurts! 
 - I hit you so that it would hurt.

118
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,530
Wait a minute.

119
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,230
Oh, right! No, this... like this...

120
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,570
Can't you combine these two?

121
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,860
Combine the story with pictures?

122
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,230
You know the "Illustrated Guide to the Five Moral Imperatives" or whatever has drawings

123
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,530
that make it easy to read, so it sells well with both adults and children, right?

124
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,890
Who looks at erotica besides men?

125
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,970
But this sort of thing, Hyeong-nim, is what both kids and adults ... well, let's leave out the kids.

126
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,970
Leave out the kids. Men and women all love it.

127
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,880
On top of that, it's entertaining. Look at this, there are pictures.

128
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,000
It's amazing. Take a look.

129
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
Wait a minute, you need this.

130
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,360
You are going to shed tears. Look at it.

131
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,620
Your Highness, will it go well?

132
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,700
I'm not sure. Both you and I are amateurs at this sort of thing.

133
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,040
 The Story of Wun Yeong

134
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,050
It's so good that it makes you cry, right?

135
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,970
Ah, it's just acceptable.

136
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,290
Just... acceptable?

137
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,700
Just acceptable ... I'll have to find someplace else to sell these—

138
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,030
I like it. I like it all. I liked the pictures and the contents. But, how are you going to make the book?

139
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,660
You can just print it with the wooden blocks and sell it.

140
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,230
Do you think it's cheap if you individually print each book with wood blocks?

141
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,320
You were going to use the wooden blocks to print the erotic book!

142
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm guaranteed to get my return on investment on those. What if I copy them, but they don't sell. What will you do then?

143
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,610
Aigoo, Hyeong-nim, don't worry about it. I'm going to sell them all.

144
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,820
I'll sell them all. I bet they will be sold-out. Don't worry!

145
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,530
Wun Yeong is so wistful to part ways with Scholar Kim. She whispers into his ears...

146
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm in the western palace. So if you would steal away at night, and climb the western wall to see me...

147
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,820
This bond we couldn't fulfill in three lifetimes...

148
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,530
I think we can fulfill it!

149
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,570
A loving woman is whispering into his ears like this, but do you think he'll go over that wall or not?

150
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,130
- He'll go over! 
 - Of course, he has to go over it!

151
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,690
- Go over it or not? Go over it or not? 
 - He'll go over it! Of course!

152
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:23,120
- Go over! Go over! Go over! 
 - Go over! Go over! Go over!

153
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,640
Stop going over it! Sit down!

154
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,240
Silly fool.

155
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,380
So ... Even though he knew he'd be killed if he were caught by the Grand Prince Anpyong,

156
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,270
our Scholar Kim begins to climb the wall.

157
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,230
Just when...

158
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,120
The court ladies know... and the Grand Prince is suspicious.

159
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,270
The disaster is about to happen.

160
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,590
"Dear my love, after we part..."

161
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,860
"I'll live in your heart..."

162
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,900
"And be sad no longer!"

163
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,470
So our Wun Yeong takes the lamplight and starts blowing.

164
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,760
And she starts pulling on her dress ribbon out like this!

165
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,900
Straight!

166
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,450
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

167
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,260
No, no!

168
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm thirsty and hungry.

169
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,010
Here! Buy this book and see for yourself.

170
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,720
"The Story of Wun Yeong"

171
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,370
This is so entertaining. And it also has drawings. Look at this.

172
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,290
Drawings! Drawings! Drawings!

173
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,380
I got it! I got it!

174
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,910
I will buy and read that book. So finish that story first!

175
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,540
Yes! Yes! Hurry and finish it!

176
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,730
Please sit down!

177
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,850
Good!

178
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,270
Our pretty Wun Yeong... pulls on her dress...

179
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,570
Straight! She's loosening the ribbon like this!

180
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,140
Loosening it like this! But that's all for today!

181
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,910
The Story of Wun Yeong! Read her story at least once.

182
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,160
It's so fun. On top of that, it has drawings!

183
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,380
It has drawings! It has drawings!

184
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,280
I saw my mother and sister being dragged into Yi I Cheom's home.

185
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,040
Ba Wu,

186
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,310
Ba Wu, I will find a way to take care of this, so please don't do anything rash—

187
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,100
Monk! This was undoubtedly done with me in their sights.

188
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,930
I will no longer sit idly by.

189
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,200
- Ba Wu! 
 - This matter involves my mother and sister's lives.

190
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,950
I won't be reckless, but...

191
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,930
I can't just stay still either

192
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,800
All right, so what are you planning to do?

193
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,790
I will try to find a way.

194
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,990
But until then, could you check to make sure that they are safe?

195
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,270
I will do that. Be careful.

196
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,160
They are not people who cause an event without thinking it over.

197
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,790
Yes.

198
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,850
What...?

199
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,940
Right, then how many did you sell?

200
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,260
Then, what about you?

201
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,590
If you find out, you will faint.

202
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,970
Really? For me, one...

203
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,030
You asked them to do this, right?

204
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,370
- That is... 
 - Are you crazy? How can you order them to do these things?

205
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,350
- Ba Wu, that is... 
 - Shut it. Just come outside.

206
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,060
- No, no, no... 
 - Come out!

207
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,940
- Court Lady Jo! 
 - Hey wait! Your Highness...

208
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,530
Aigoo, my goodness.

209
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,320
Ba Wu...

210
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,860
It's not his fault. I wanted to do it.

211
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,050
- Then, get rid of it right away. 
 - I don't want to.

212
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,720
- What? 
 - I'm grateful that you care for me.

213
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,650
However, I can't lean on you forever.

214
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,160
It is said, "without a stable occupation, one cannot be steadfast". You haven't secured an occupation yet,

215
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,410
so how could you maintain an upright mind?

216
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,600
I understand what you are thinking. Still, this is not right. Give it up.

217
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,350
- Didn't I say that I don't want to?
 - Move aside!

218
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,450
What did you say to me until now?

219
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,120
Didn't you ask me until when I'm going to live as a princess?

220
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,550
I wanted it and I chose it on my own. Don't even think about stopping me.

221
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:12,260
So, you'll keep drawing these vulgar pictures and writing stories?

222
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,400
I can't bear to see that!

223
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,440
No, that...

224
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,720
Then, what are you planning to do?

225
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,810
Whether we succeed or fail, I will take care of it myself. Don't worry about it.

226
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,590
You are such a pathetic man.

227
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,430
- What? 
 - Do you think her highness easily made this decision?

228
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,650
She pondered over it tens, hundreds, thousands of times more than you did.

229
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,590
In that case, you can get rid of it right now!

230
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,500
Then, what about this house? What about money?

231
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,650
Nanny...

232
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,180
Don't stop me.

233
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,350
You were lacking money, you couldn't figure out what to do and  she helped you, so you should be thankful!

234
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,250
Are you just putting forward your pride because you are a man?

235
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,380
That's enough.

236
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,700
Look here, Ba Wu. Calm down. Let's go inside the room and have a talk...

237
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,190
That, that...!

238
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,960
- W-wait... 
 - Y-your Highness...

239
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,190
I don't expect you to sweet-talk to him.

240
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,830
How can you pour salt over an open wound?

241
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,220
Whose fault is this? Whose fault is this? What did you do right? What did you do right?

242
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,470
- Yes, it's because of me! 
 - Don't step on it!

243
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,040
- What should we do about this? 
 - Aigoo!

244
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,450
Oh, such precious pages...

245
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,110
Here!

246
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,840
Is this all? Who am I supposed to sell it to?

247
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,200
This is barely enough to sell, let alone lend it to someone else!

248
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,900
Hyeong-nim! We broke our wrists to write and draw these books.

249
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,460
So, what did I say? I said that we should print the book with wood blocks!

250
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,230
I did request the carpenters...

251
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,200
But is this something that's done in one day or so?

252
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,180
Anyway, gather all the scribes.

253
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll try to request the drawings somehow.

254
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,320
Take a break.

255
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,910
It's been a long time since I last wrote something, so it's hard.

256
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,940
I don't think we can meet the deadline at this rate.

257
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,800
That's true. We're in trouble.

258
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,090
Please come out.

259
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,260
Is something the matter?

260
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,410
I'll go and take a look.

261
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,090
 The Story of Wun Yeong

262
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,930
 The Story of Wun Yeong, "Love Affair at the Royal Palace"  between court lady Wun Yeong and a classical scholar.

263
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,980
 The Story of Wun Yeong

264
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,010
You worked hard.

265
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,420
Thank you.

266
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,730
 Wanted:  Kim Dae Seok.

267
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,510
The criminal is  Kim Dae Seok, eldest grandson of the traitor Kim Je Nam.

268
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:34,060
Born in year Gapjin, he is six feet tall, well-built and good-looking.

269
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,700
To anyone who informs us of this man's whereabouts,

270
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,410
the crown will give 50 rolls of cotton.

271
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,230
You made a long trip. Thank you.

272
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,390
There are many eyes watching, so first let's go up.

273
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,550
- Lord Zhang, please  go.  
 - Yes  (In Chinese)

274
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,100
 (This is a Ming official)

275
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,770
Let me pour you a drink this time.

276
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,930
I heard that His Excellency Head Eunuch Wei was made minister of the Eastern Depot*. 
  (spy and secret police agency run by eunuchs)

277
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,930
Please make sure to convey to him my congratulations on his success.

278
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,600
 (Translated to Chinese).

279
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Thank you for your hospitality.  (In Chinese)

280
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,270
Thank you for your hospitality.

281
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,800
It is I who am thankful.

282
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,400
This letter is from my father to His Excellency Head Eunuch Wei.

283
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,600
 (Translates into Chinese)

284
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,970
It's an important letter, so I look forward to your kind cooperation.

285
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
  (Translates into Chinese)

286
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Enter.

287
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,530
 (sycee  or yuanbao: gold and silver ingot currency used in imperial China, valued by its weight in taels)

288
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,410
I've prepared this for your travel expenses.

289
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,130
I'll place it on your ship when you leave.

290
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,660
Great. Great. 
  (In Chinese)

291
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,630
His lordship Zhang will take good care of this

292
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,100
before passing it on to Head Eunuch Wei. So he wants you to know to not worry about it.

293
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,260
Oho, what are you doing? The lord is not raising his cup of alcohol.

294
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,090
Lord Zhang, I will trust you.

295
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,500
 (translates into Chinese)

296
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,000
- A letter? 
 - Yes. It seemed important.

297
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,980
He kept it in the chest which contains the silver eunwonbo*. 
 (Korean name of the yuanbao ingots)

298
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,280
Thank you.  Return before you arouse suspicion.

299
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,930
 Yeon Ok.  What is happening?

300
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,330
 Yeon Ok.  Yeon Ok.

301
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,110
Is it because it's the middle of the month? The moon sure is bright.

302
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,550
Haven't you slept yet?

303
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,800
You must be tired, drawing all day.

304
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,230
I was planning to go to sleep after seeing you return, but I missed the timing.

305
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,870
The night air is better than I expected.

306
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,340
Let's sit down.

307
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,730
♫  On a night darkness swallows the light  ♫

308
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,760
♫  On a long silent night  ♫

309
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:04,900
♫  Even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds  ♫

310
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:18,710
♫  On a night when even the wind sleeps silently
  ♫

311
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,050
What? It seemed you came back late.

312
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,830
Did you already wake up?

313
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,280
I actually had my first decent night's rest in a long while.

314
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,670
Are you still looking for me?

315
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,550
What's going on?

316
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,930
You indescribable rogues!

317
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,940
What are you staring straight at?  Come here.

318
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,200
Come here, you knaves!

319
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,530
Master, it's him.

320
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,870
What are you doing?

321
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,310
Hurry up and catch him.

322
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,820
This Geo Jeong isn't dead.

323
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,750
I am alive. Come on.

324
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,650
Come.

325
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:58,170
Come! Come! Come!

326
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,670
 The king of Joseon Yi Hon* has forgotten His Imperial Majesty's grace. 
 (Gwanghae's personal name)

327
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,400
 And he is avoiding conflict with the barbarians* in the north.  
 (the Jurchens of the Later Jin dynasty)

328
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,960
 As a loyal subject who has never forgotten the emperor's kindness, I can no longer sit idly by.

329
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,660
 I would like to oust the wicked Yi Hon and set Joseon right again.

330
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,960
 After we have successfully deposed him, I would like you to petition to His Imperial Majesty

331
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,720
 to officially recognize our new king. I will make sure to repay that debt.

332
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,620
 In addition, for His Imperial Majesty's war against the northern barbarians who cause him much trouble,

333
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,030
 I will send ten thousand of Joseon's élite soldiers and a hundred thousand sacks of rations to Ming.

334
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,170
"Ten thousand élite soldiers... and a hundred thousand sacks of rations"?

335
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,680
As long as the treason succeeds, he doesn't care if Joseon collapses or not.

336
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,390
I'd like to promote Jeong Gu Yul, Kim Yong Bu, Min Han Sang, and Kim Ja Jeom.

337
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,660
What do you think?

338
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,270
  Promotion of Jeong Gu Yul, Kim Yong Bu, Min Han Sang, and Kim Ja Jeom dated 1622, 12th Lunar Month

339
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,050
I would like you to ensure the agreement of the officials as you promised.

340
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,890
I consider the rest of these fit for promotion and agree...

341
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,220
But I do not think Kim Ja Jeom, who is currently under investigation by the inspector general is suitable.

342
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,290
Please rescind your order, Your Majesty.

343
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,230
The matter with the inspector general is something you can resolve with your own authority.

344
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,850
Is there anyone who doesn't have dirt on him if you look for it?

345
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,600
- But, Your Majesty— 
 - Do you intend to break your promise?

346
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,960
Jeong Gu Yul will be promoted to deputy commander of the Royal Investigation Bureau.

347
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,360
Kim Yong Bu to the department of Justice,  Min Han Sang to the post of royal secretary of Defense.

348
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,260
And I appoint Kim Ja Jeom to the position of Deputy Administration Officer, 6th senior rank, at the Defense Ministry.

349
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,500
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty! 
 - Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

350
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,430
What is the next order of business?

351
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,320
What is this?

352
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,120
I, Defense Ministry Deputy Administration Officer Kim Ja Jeom, would like to speak. 
 - Speak.

353
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,200
This is a novel that's popular in the city.

354
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,570
A court lady of Grand Prince Anpyeong shares an illicit liaison with a man in her in-law's family.

355
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,010
The book describes an indescribably filthy relationship

356
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,780
and even contains morally shameful pictures.

357
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,550
What's that? How could anyone be so lawless?

358
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,220
What has the police chief been doing, allowing such vile books to circulate?

359
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,200
Were you aware of this, left police chief?

360
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,830
I asked if you were aware!

361
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,960
Please execute me, Your Majesty!

362
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,890
You will find every single book in circulation and burn them all.

363
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,710
You will harshly punish anyone who is found hiding or reading it!

364
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,130
Yes, Your Majesty!

365
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,670
 The Story of Wun Yeong

366
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,240
Kim Ja Jeom! You rotten bastard who deserves worse than death!

367
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,900
You did well!

368
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,850
It's been a long time since his majesty laughed. You did great work today.

369
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,040
It was only because you told me about the existence of such books.

370
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,350
How could I not know about something that's so popular among the court ladies?

371
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,250
It's not just the court ladies, but even within the city walls, it's rare for a woman who's familiar with Hangeul to not have read it.

372
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,760
If so many people have read it, it won't be easy for the left police chief to handle this problem.

373
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,590
There will be wives and daughters of palace officials, he will have quite a headache with this.

374
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,970
 The Story of Wun Yeong

375
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,520
Mother. It's your son Won Yeop.

376
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,000
Mother?

377
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,390
Mother!

378
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,720
Isn't that a forbidden book?

379
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
It isn't! It's not anything like that.

380
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,420
Please give it here.

381
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,540
- I told you it's nothing. 
 - Mother!

382
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,500
I was merely reading it out of curiosity. Please keep it a secret from your fath—

383
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,010
Where did you get this?

384
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,520
I asked where you got this!

385
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,650
The peddler woman...

386
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,020
told me that no one hasn't read this these days.

387
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,160
Since everyone was reading it, she left it for me to look at.

388
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Hyeong-nim.

389
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,940
- You were at home? 
 - Yes.

390
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,110
But... has something happened? You don't look good.

391
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,950
I'm sorry.

392
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,960
- For what? 
 - It seems it's because of the forbidden book.

393
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,620
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help to you.

394
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,250
Follow me to my room.

395
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,160
 The Story of Wun Yeong

396
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,650
"The Story of Wun Yeong"...

397
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,200
Isn't this the forbidden book? Was Mother reading this?

398
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,460
I can't believe that accursed book has already spread throughout the whole palace.

399
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,620
But I never expected Mother to read this, since she rarely leaves the home.

400
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,530
Just what kind of contents are in this book?

401
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,450
It's not erotica, and there's not much in the contents.

402
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,830
It's a predictable romance novel.

403
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,490
It just so happened to be about a court lady and a relative of the king, and that's what caused this ruckus.

404
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,220
It was already a problem because the bookstore owners' lips are tightly sealed.

405
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,880
Now I'm afraid what would come out of their lips,

406
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,200
so I can't even strike them as I wish.

407
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,930
This book... can I take this and look over it?

408
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,880
Why?

409
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,020
I think I've seen the drawings somewhere.

410
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,120
Really? Where?

411
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,390
I'm not sure yet...

412
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,130
If something comes to mind, could I do my own personal investigation?

413
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,860
If we find the artist, we should also be able to find the person who wrote and distributed the books.

414
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:17,860
If we can have him, shouldn't this forbidden book problem resolve itself without incident?

415
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,560
Please trust and leave this to me, Hyeong-nim.

416
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,540
All right. If you find any leads, let me know right away.

417
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,120
Yes. Hyeong-nim.

418
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,630
 What exactly is going on?

419
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,750
 Why are you going so far to draw something like this?

420
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,930
It's Cha Dol's father...

421
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,860
It looks like something's wrong. His expression wasn't good. Do you know anything?

422
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,920
That can't be. He looked chipper and fine to me.

423
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,570
Forget it. I was wrong to ask you.

424
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,290
Why is she like that with only me?

425
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,260
So that man Yi I Cheom really is plotting treason.

426
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,900
Yes.

427
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,530
Wouldn't it be better if you took this letter and submitted it to the king?

428
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,410
I had considered that, but there's a wanted poster of me now.

429
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,260
The wanted poster is one thing, but while I am trying to prevent treason,

430
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,470
I still don't know what could happen to me.

431
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,030
They could still kill my mother and sister.

432
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,130
Then what do you plan to do?

433
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,260
I do have a way.

434
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,540
Ah, really!

435
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,400
Ah! I told you I don't know!

436
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,300
I wasn't close with that blasted Ba Wu.

437
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,090
I didn't even know where his home was when he lived in Hanyang.

438
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,860
I will ask you for the last time. Ba Wu and Chun Bae...

439
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,390
Where are those bastards?

440
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,400
I do not know, sir.

441
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,390
Around these parts, when you're running away, you don't tell anyone.

442
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,210
That's how you lose your pursuers.

443
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm telling you the truth!

444
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,200
I saw him once with the slave hunters... and never again!

445
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
You know the people who supply the erotica, don't you?

446
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,260
What?

447
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,500
You'll wish you knew if you don't.

448
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,200
- You found them? 
 -  I think they're in Jemulpo.

449
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,740
- Are you certain? 
 - I'm not, but the source is reliable.

450
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,660
Where is it? I must go personally.

451
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,660
Shouldn't you focus on finding Kim Je Nam's grandson?

452
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,830
This could be a wasted journey, so if you would just send one man with me, I will go there and investigate this personally.

453
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,230
I'm grateful for the thought, but this is important to me too. So I cannot be careless.

454
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,290
If it's Jemulpo, it's within the left police's jurisdiction, so it's a chance for you to raise yourself.

455
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,730
Would I dare treat this matter lightly? Please trust me.

456
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,600
All right. Then I will leave this in your hands. So waste not one second to bring me definitive results.

457
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,770
Yes, Hyeong-nim.

458
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,410
Who are you?

459
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,940
I thought you posted wanted posters all over the eight provinces of Joseon looking for me. Was I wrong?

460
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,010
You probably can't recognize me because I covered my face.

461
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,530
Is that Kim Dae Seok?

462
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,620
It is.

463
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,190
I am the first grandson of the man once called Kim Je Nam, Kim Dae Seok

464
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,080
Have you come to get revenge?

465
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,880
If I had come to get revenge, you would have already been dead.

466
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,820
Then, you must have come to search for your mother and sister.

467
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,980
Bring my mother and sister.

468
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,480
What if I can't do that?

469
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,490
Do you want to die?

470
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,570
If I die, you will die as well.

471
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,020
Do you think that I fear death?

472
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,780
Even if you don't fear death,

473
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,060
you probably fear your mother and sister dying.

474
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,640
Until now, I have followed your movements.

475
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,370
The matters with the princess too...

476
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,720
For someone who hid a grudge in his heart and lived as a street rat, you're too affectionate.

477
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,440
You could never give up your mother and sister

478
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,800
for the sake of vengeance.

479
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,390
Am I wrong?

480
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,360
Damn it.

481
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,560
I knew this would happen.

482
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,070
It's amazing how much you evil men scheme.

483
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,420
You already know I lived as a street rat.

484
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,580
Why are you so surprised?

485
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,580
Do you know what this is?

486
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,740
Doesn't it look really familiar?

487
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,750
It can't be!

488
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,320
It is. It's the letter you sent to the emperor of Ming,

489
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,340
pleading for help to betray the king, promising to sell all of Joseon to do it.

490
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,090
How is that in your hands?

491
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,780
You can find that out for yourself.

492
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,010
Oh, the ship has already left... so I guess you can't check?

493
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,800
That's enough small talk.

494
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,880
If you want this letter back,

495
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,460
The day after tomorrow at sulshi*, bring my mother and sister to the shrine in front of Sungnye Gate.
 (hour of the dog: 7 p.m. - 9 p.m.)

496
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,450
If you try to pull any tricks, this will go straight to the king's hands.

497
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,710
How will I know that you won't be the one to pull tricks on me?

498
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,620
Tricks and deception... aren't they your specialties?

499
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,850
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

500
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,920
Listen!

501
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
Is there nobody outside?

502
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,490
Have you found him?

503
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,250
It seems that he has already disappeared.

504
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,860
His mother and sister were not disturbed.

505
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,880
Strengthen the guards in the home, and move that bastard's mother and sister to a different place.

506
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,880
And, at daybreak, send men to the shrine

507
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,300
and have that area thoroughly investigated!

508
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,950
Yes!

509
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,600
The shrine is here,

510
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,250
and Samgaenaru isn't here, but here.

511
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,460
I see.

512
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,820
Then this should be Sungnye Gate.

513
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,060
Yes.

514
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,710
Since I've sufficiently explained to you what my plans are, I'll be back at this time tomorrow.

515
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,410
It'll be daybreak while you go.

516
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,380
How about sleeping here tonight?

517
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,310
No.

518
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,950
I don't know what will happen the day after tomorrow.

519
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,980
I should at least see Cha Dol's face before leaving.

520
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,820
Then come at dawn the day after tomorrow.

521
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,860
Since you're meeting him at sulshi...

522
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,450
shouldn't that give you enough time to prepare?

523
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,070
He's not just any man.

524
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,480
Before the sun rises the day after tomorrow, I should prepare to already be there.

525
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,090
I will see you tomorrow night.

526
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,950
Go away.

527
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,080
Ah, why, dear? I'm trying to make you warm because you might be cold.

528
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,560
It's hot...

529
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,140
Are you going somewhere?

530
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,950
I have some business in Hanyang.

531
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,820
Hanyang?

532
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:23,730
I might spend the night there, so don't wait up for me.

533
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,730
Is it something I can't know about?

534
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,590
I'm sorry. I will tell you when I get back.

535
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,020
- Young Master! 
 - Brother-in-law!

536
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,800
It's that man. He's the man who made the drawings.

537
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,320
- H-hey Wait wait! 
 - H-hey Wait wait!

538
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,890
Wait one second.

539
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,490
N-no, wait.

540
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,300
- No ... 
 - Your Highess!

541
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,260
Your Highness!

542
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,840
Brother-in-law! Why are you doing this?

543
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,910
This man isn't it! He is...

544
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,000
- Take him out immediately! 
- Yes!

545
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,930
No!

546
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,080
You have it wrong! The one who should be arrested is me!

547
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,340
- What are you doing? 
 - Yes!

548
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,060
- Wait, no! 
 - Ba Wu!

549
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,000
Ba Wu!

550
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,430
Brother-in-law!

551
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,730
Brother-in-law, the person who drew those pictures wasn't him, but me.

552
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,400
So please take me instead.

553
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,100
Brother-in-law!

554
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,300
Brother-in-law.

555
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,810
Ba Wu!

556
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,040
Ba Wu!

557
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,920
Ba Wu...

558
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,380
Ba Wu!

559
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,160
Ba Wu...

560
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,180
Ba Wu! Ba Wu...

561
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,160
Ba Wu...

562
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,420
Ba Wu! Ba Wu...

563
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,560
What should we do?

564
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,200
You! Why are you...?

565
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,240
Don't tell me instead of your wife, you—

566
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,360
Watch your mouth.

567
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,520
Talk about my wife one more time, and I will send you to the afterlife in your sleep.

568
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,370
Got it?

569
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,490
Please...

570
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,750
Please reconsider this!

571
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,320
Just charging straight in won't even guarantee you'll see him. It's too dangerous.

572
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,020
You'll really be in trouble if you do this—!

573
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,280
Please turn back.

574
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,880
I will not change my mind, no matter what you say.

575
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,590
Then tell me the reason you are doing this.

576
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,290
The reason?

577
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,720
Isn't it obvious that I should interrogate a criminal for his crimes?

578
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,330
Didn't I tell you that he isn't the criminal, but I am?

579
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,620
He has already confessed that he did it.

580
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,040
No, you must have come here already knowing everything.

581
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,750
Because as soon as you saw that novel, you would have recognized my drawings.

582
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,310
If you are here to see that man, it's impossible.

583
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,630
So please go back.

584
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,180
Until I have my answer I cannot do that.

585
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,580
If you are the brother-in-law that I knew, there must be another reason you are doing this.

586
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,400
So...

587
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,670
Then I will ask you one thing also.

588
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:38,600
Did you leave me just so you could live like this?

589
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:44,510
It may look like I'm barely living to you, but I am happy right now.

590
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,150
That is my answer.

591
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,030
Now it's your turn to answer me. Why are you holding him instead of me—?

592
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,190
I must do this!

593
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,290
In order to protect you.

594
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,850
Because this is the only reason for me to live.

595
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,280
That is my answer.

596
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,730
Escort her highness the princess home.

597
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,240
And... you mustn't let her out of her home for the time being.

598
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,620
It's too dangerous for her to be noticed by other people.

599
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,250
I understand what you're saying, but...

600
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,960
I don't know if she would listen to me—

601
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,140
Forcibly keep her if you must.

602
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,770
That is the only way... for the princess to live.

603
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,090
Yes, I understand.

604
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,660
But...

605
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,020
Ba Wu... that man. What will happen to him?

606
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,570
Have you returned?

607
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,710
Cha Dol, why are you out?

608
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,110
Nobody is home.

609
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:26,180
But where have you been?

610
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,540
Where's Father?

611
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,450
Y-your father left for  Cheonan. Cheonan.

612
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,380
So he left to see Grandma. I wish he had taken me.

613
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,870
I want to see Grandma too.

614
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:45,540
Next time... Let's have him take you next time.

615
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,680
Sit! Sit!

616
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,350
What happened? Have you seen Ba Wu?

617
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,610
That...

618
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,380
I only heard he was being transferred to the left police station.

619
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,420
I mean, isn't there anything else we can do?

620
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,620
If he gets dragged to the left police station like this...

621
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,170
my Ba Wu... will die!

622
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,980
He wouldn't die over a few drawings!

623
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,430
I told you that's not what's going on!

624
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,510
Then? Is it because of Brother-in-law?

625
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,790
If so, don't you worry.

626
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,620
No... it's not that.

627
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,990
If it's not that then what is it? You're being intolerably annoying!

628
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,830
It's that...

629
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,320
My Ba Wu is...

630
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,520
What about him?

631
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,470
Ba Wu is...

632
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,590
Ah, this is so frustrating I'm going mad!

633
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,420
Now I'm feeling frustrated. What's wrong with him?

634
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,220
You must not, Your Highness.

635
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,090
Don't worry, I won't go anywhere near the government office.

636
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,910
Then... where are you going?

637
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,830
I'm feeling stuffy. I want to go see the ocean for a little while.

638
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,080
Then I will take you there—

639
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,380
I wish to go by myself.

640
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,360
I will merely follow you.

641
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,640
I'll watch you from afar.

642
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,950
I want to cry.

643
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,510
I think the only way I'll feel alive is if I cry as loud as I'd like to, where nobody is watching.

644
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,720
Whether it's close by or from afar, if you're watching me,

645
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,050
can I cry freely?

646
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,950
Your Highness...

647
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,790
 Take them.

648
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,490
What is it?

649
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:36,080
I am here to see the left state councillor's son who came from Hanyang.

650
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,740
Is he inside by chance?

651
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,040
Who are you to look for him?

652
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,430
I am a relative.

653
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:11,760
If you have something to say, say it. Don't hesitate.

654
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,820
Let me ask you one thing.

655
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,420
Can you answer me honestly?

656
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,020
Say it.

657
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,930
The incident with the drawings may be more serious than expected, and may not end with a few floggings.

658
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,640
Your life may be in danger.

659
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,430
Can you still take the blame instead of the princess until the very end?

660
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:40,270
I'm pretty sure that's not what you're curious about.

661
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:45,550
What? The fact that you're Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson?

662
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:50,300
Whether you're Kim Dae Seok or Ba Wu, as long as the princess is safe,

663
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,630
I care not at all whether you take vengeance or not.

664
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,610
What would you do if I take vengeance on your family?

665
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,690
Is it because of your mother and sister?

666
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,300
Don't worry about your mother and sister's safety.

667
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,750
They were taken hostage in order to capture you,

668
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,070
so until you're captured, not much will happen to them.

669
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,430
What? "Not much will happen"?

670
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,400
What a load of dog crap.

671
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,690
She is locked up at the house of her enemy who killed her husband and made her into a slave.

672
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,380
She's shivering in fear because she has no idea what will happen next.

673
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,020
"Not much... will happen?"

674
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,900
That's not what I meant.

675
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,440
I'm sure you didn't.

676
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,460
The assailant usually doesn't care about the person he's beating.

677
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,860
So... will you really take vengeance?

678
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:46,090
Why? Would you kill me now if I were?

679
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:50,070
Give it up. Just forget everything and live as you've been doing.

680
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,010
I'm saying this for your sake—

681
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,000
What a load of utter dog crap you're spouting!

682
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,480
Your father posted wanted posters of me in the eight provinces of Joseon in order to kill me.

683
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,470
He even took my mother and sister hostage.

684
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:05,460
And you think if I run for my life for as long as I live... that's good for me?

685
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,720
It's not for me, but for you and your father's benefit.

686
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,620
I intended to live my life as Ba Wu, forgetting both my enemy and about vengeance.

687
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:22,950
But your family has made me into Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson Kim Dae Seok.

688
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:27,150
If I live as Kim Dae Seok, it is because your father made me this way!

689
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,230
If anything happens to my mother and sister...

690
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,690
I will show you what a true madman is like.

691
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,470
I will.

692
01:01:53,500 --> 01:02:04,500
♫  There are still words that have been left unsaid  ♫

693
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:10,090
 I intended to live my life as Ba Wu, forgetting both my enemy and about vengeance.

694
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:16,660
 But your family has made me into Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson Kim Dae Seok.

695
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,190
♫  They scatter like flower petals   ♫

696
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,820
 It is better I die...

697
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,050
 for you as well.

698
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,810
 Why are you going this far for me?

699
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:31,780
♫  The new spring wind weeps   ♫

700
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,430
 I'm like you.

701
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,860
♫  Although the seasons pass without fail   ♫

702
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,310
 I'm already a dead person.

703
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:45,950
♫  You become a step farther away  ♫

704
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,740
♫  The faint memory that blew away with the wind   ♫

705
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,980
 I guess Cha Dol didn't tell you this yet.

706
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:01,030
 The only person I trust less than a pretty woman is the king.

707
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,700
 Resent your royal bloodline!

708
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,160
♫  The petal of new spring brought by the clouds   ♫

709
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,310
 Do you still not understand?

710
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:12,980
 Should I be even more blunt? I'm sick of seeing you bumbling about.

711
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:17,120
 So that was why you were crying so.

712
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,710
 That was why you didn't trust the king.

713
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,380
♫  The boat sails as if dancing   ♫

714
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,690
 That was why you tried to kill me!

715
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,250
♫   Suddenly my heart also flows   ♫

716
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,090
 That was why you wanted to part ways with me!

717
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,080
 All for me...

718
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:40,280
♫ And that is how it scatters ♫

719
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:59,530
Hey, w-wait just a moment! If someone recognizes you, as Court Lady Jo fears—

720
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,950
That man risked his life to save mine.

721
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:04,970
And you're telling me to hide for fear of my own life?

722
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,170
- It's not that— 
 - If you cannot be convinced, I will go on my own.

723
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,980
Thank you for your hard work.

724
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,030
Take this and put this deep... deep.

725
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,220
Deep in your pockets!

726
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,560
Have you lost your mind?

727
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,000
Where do you think this is? Leave at once!

728
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:41,400
Tell me. Has something happened?

729
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,350
Then why are you like this?

730
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,310
Are you sure you're fine?

731
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:02,760
Are you... not hurt anywhere?

732
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,060
Not in pain?

733
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,220
As you can see...

734
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,420
I'm normally as sturdy as a rock, so none of this hurts me.

735
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:16,430
Don't worry about me. And take care of yourself.

736
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,410
Your face has gotten quite haggard.

737
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,140
I'm sorry.

738
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,430
I'm always the source of calamity.

739
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,440
It's because of me.

740
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,040
When the sinner is me.

741
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:40,370
Did someone die? Please leave now.

742
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,970
I said, leave!

743
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,260
And... don't ever come back again.

744
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:03,420
 A dead man who isn't dead. Such a lonely and painful life!

745
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,840
 How were you able to withstand it all this time?

746
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:12,950
 What were you going to do with all of that anguish?

747
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:24,590
 All of that resentment, and your family...

748
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:29,230
 you gave all of that up for my sake?  
♫  Words you don't mean  ♫

 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

755
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:16,220
 If you give up that man, he will live.

756
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:20,390
 This is my intent and the reason why I've been preparing the dethronement of the king.

757
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,650
 Will you follow me?

758
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:25,390
 Yes, Father.

759
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:28,730
 It seems the only way to save Ba Wu is to get the ledger.

760
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,690
 Who are you? Stop them!

761
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:34,730
 His majesty must never find out that the princess is alive.

762
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:37,830
 We must make a lie into truth.

763
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,490
 If you want to live, do this at all costs.

764
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,470
 Hurry up and prepare for the interrogation.

765
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:46,420
 There cannot be any mistakes. Make sure to prepare flawlessly.

766
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,010
 I must kill that bastard by tonight.

767
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,920
