00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,440
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,500
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,070
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,050

5
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,060
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,290
Bring out the criminal.

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,920
Bring out the criminal!

9
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,890
 That is right.

10
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,990
 I am the grandson of Kim Je Nam, Kim Dae Seok.

11
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,910
Begin the questioning.

12
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,440
 Episode 12

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,540
Are you Jeong Gap Nam, born  gapjin (1604), living in South Hanseong?

15
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,020
I am.

16
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,520
You have confessed receiving a request from the deceased bookstore owner, Jo Man Su,

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,760
and making the drawings for a banned book called the "Story of Wun Yeong" for him.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,960
- Do you acknowledge that? 
 - I do.

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,910
Have you seen this ledger before?

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,200
I have. It is the bookstore's accounting book.

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,390
Are you certain of this?

22
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,870
I am certain because this ledger was verified for every payment received from selling a book.

23
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,500
Is this the only ledger?

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,490
To my knowledge,

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,550
there is one other ledger.

26
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,830
Do you say this knowing what would happen to you if you lie?

27
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,410
Yes, I am well aware.

28
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,460
Your Majesty, this is something I had not seen nor heard

29
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,080
while conducting the investigation and interrogation of the deceased bookstore owner.

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,120
I am certain there was only one accounting book.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,820
It is a certitude this man is lying. Please discipline him with severe punishment.

32
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,560
That is not true, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,140
The accounting book is here.

34
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,110
Officials from the Office of Royal Decrees skilled in penmanship have verified it.

35
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,240
The handwriting of the two books are exactly the same.

36
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,970
Bring me the ledgers.

37
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:04,340
Even in my eyes, it is certain that these two ledgers have been written by the same person.

38
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,220
- Read it. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,250
Lady Jo, daughter-in-law of the Minister of Justice Han Chan Nam.

40
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,900
Lady Park, wife of the Deputy Minister of Defense Park Jeong Gil.

41
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,160
Lady Jeong, wife of the Censor-General Yun In

42
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,860
and the Royal Secretary of Finance Park Hong Do himself.

43
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,990
What happened? This is different from what we talked about.

44
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,490
Your Excellency!

45
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,660
Everyone is gathered in the meeting chamber.

46
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,630
Let us go there for now.

47
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,150
I will follow you in an instant, so go there before me.

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,660
Yes, Your Excellency.

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,890
All of this is that rascal Dae Yeop's schemes.

50
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,020
Lower your voice.

51
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,830
I will go to the meeting chamber and calm them down.

52
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,150
- You go home first. Once thereâ€” 
 - I will start by looking for Dae Yeop.

53
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,800
Make haste.

54
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,830
Do you resent me?

55
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,380
Are you truly Kim Je Nam's grandson, Kim Dae Seok?

56
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
I am.

57
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,760
Why do you think you are here?

58
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,300
It must be because I am of use.

59
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,750
You rascal. Who do you think you are addressing?

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,850
What use do you think you have?

61
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,520
Are you not intending to make me your sword?

62
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,250
You are an interesting fellow.

63
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,500
How can you become my sword?

64
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,310
Wouldn't you be a sword incapable of cutting down even one leaf?

65
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,960
The sword hasn't been annealed yet.

66
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
Is that so?

67
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,730
Then, what would anneal that sword?

68
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,900
Please restore my name.

69
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,520
I will become a sword that can cut even through a heart's worries.

70
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,360
How is Hwa In doing?

71
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,840
Let me ask you one more time.

72
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,100
How are you getting along with Hwa In?

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Good. If you want to properly temper that sword,

74
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,520
I'm going to open a special exam period next month, so pass the military examination then.

75
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,610
I will hear your answer afterward. Take him out.

76
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,010
- What about Dae Yeop? 
 - It seems he made plans to disappear.

77
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,220
He even took a few garments and valuables with him.

78
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,230
It seems all this had been carefully planned out.

79
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,850
I cannot seem to understand.

80
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,570
Why would Dae Yeop do that kind of thing?

81
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,230
Could he have discovered the secret about himself?

82
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,000
My aunt could have told him.

83
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,260
Send someone to Sangwon Temple and bring back your aunt.

84
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,530
Yes, Father.

85
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,560
Find a way to kill that rascal.

86
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,490
If we cannot find Dae Yeop, we must at least kill Kim Je Nam's grandson.

87
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,150
If you get caught, commit suicide immediately.

88
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,570
The one who opens his mouth will see his entire family killed as well.

89
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,820
Retreat!

90
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,320
Yi I Cheom was getting anxious.

91
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,020
We do not know what else he might attempt again, so be thoroughly prepared.

92
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,060
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Your Majesty, Court Lady Kim is at the door.

93
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,300
Let her enter.

94
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,270
What is it?

95
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,690
The vice captain of the Left Police Bureau wrote and left a suicide note and hung himself.

96
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,620
 He committed suicide after leaving a suicide note saying everything was his wrongdoing?

97
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,900
Yes. It seems they are blaming everything on him.

98
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,520
Yi I Cheom is really flailing in desperation.

99
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,870
How would you like to react?

100
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Tell Kim Ja Jeom to mobilize the Western faction and the Confucian scholars.

101
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,420
If we lose this opportunity, we do not know when another will come.

102
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,730
We need to put Yi I Cheom and the Greater Northern faction in their place.

103
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,360
We need to show the Confucian scholars that we, the Western faction, are still alive.

104
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,150
Put your strength together. Do you understand?

105
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,490
Let us all pour our strength out!

106
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,320
Understood!

107
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,650
Let's do it!

108
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:08,490
There are endless petitions to strip the chief of the left police of his rank and send him into exile.

109
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,690
He overstepped his boundaries too much with this incident.

110
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,050
I didn't bring this up in order to preserve your dignity...

111
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,790
But this ledger contains your wife's name too.

112
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,560
The people in charge of this investigation said that

113
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,190
I've left cats in charge of fish.

114
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,000
I am terribly regretful, Your Majesty.

115
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,550
If I am to appease the Westerners...

116
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,260
It seems that at the very least I will have to strip him from his title and send him into exile.

117
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,910
How do you think I should handle this matter?

118
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:52,560
If I am to appease the Westerners, I will need quite a big fish...

119
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,220
Among the requests of the Westerners...

120
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,060
They wish for everyone involved in the incident with Grand Prince Yeongchang to have their titles restored.

121
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,660
When I think about it, most of them had already been either killed or pardoned anyway...

122
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,380
I don't think there would be any serious repercussions.

123
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,940
What do you think?

124
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,390
- But Your Majesty... 
 - In return...

125
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,680
As you've always insisted, I won't release Queen Inmok's from her confinement in the Western Palace.

126
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,120
I don't have time...

127
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,940
Make your decision promptly.

128
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,700
Step forth, Chief Officer of the Left Police.

130
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,460
As the Chief Officer of the Left Police...

131
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,620
You were unable to manage your position and threw the country into chaos.

132
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,000
Do you acknowledge your own mistakes?

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,990
The left police chief officer Yi Won Yeop...

135
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,310
will be demoted by one rank, to answer for the mismanagement of his position.

136
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,690
However, your past accomplishments are too great to justify dismissing you from office.

137
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,790
So I will not discharge you for this.

138
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,110
Your grace is immeasurable.

139
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,040
And... the country's  Confucian scholars are protesting with a sit-in.

140
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I heard that the students of the Royal Academy of Sunkyunkwan have left the premises as a sign of protest as well.

141
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,490
So... I think I will issue a massive pardon in order to pacify them.

142
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,600
Restore the status of everyone involved in Kim Je Nam's case during the ousting of Prince Yeongchang!

143
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,480
- Your grace is immeasurable! 
 - Your grace is immeasurable!

144
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,870
You and your household's titles have been restored.

145
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,550
Congratulations.

146
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,200
The Westerners are waiting outside, straining their necks to see and congratulate you.

147
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,590
Hurry and go.

148
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,560
No. I will leave through the back exit.

149
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,940
Even until yesterday, I had no place to call home in any faction...

150
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,270
and suddenly I'm a Westerner now.

151
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,670
I'm sorry.

152
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,330
What do you plan to do now?

153
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,320
 The person who told my father your identity... was Kim Ja Jeom.

154
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,860
Why do you look at me like that?

155
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,940
I'm just so thankful. That's why.

156
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,400
I only did what was expected of me.

157
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,630
Don't worry about it.

158
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,520
Then where will you be going?

159
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,830
I must see my family first.

160
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,530
 Yi Mok Ji Sin

161
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,230
Lift your head.

162
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,290
 Yi Mok Ji Sin

163
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,370
 A politician's word is worth a thousand gold coins.

164
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,350
 You said such a man should never lie,

165
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,350
 and Your Majesty also promised me that you would do the same.

166
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,440
Do you believe that I held deceit in my lips?

167
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,990
I will tell you what "Yi Mok Ji Sin" means.

168
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,730
I will open a special examination period next month, so you are to pass the military service exam.

169
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,080
If you truly support Hwa In and me, prove it.

170
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,520
Pass the military exam,

171
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,200
and be my sword and shield at my side.

172
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,480
Can you do that?

173
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,160
Yes.

174
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,640
Additionally, you are to report every little thing your father does to me.

175
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,470
Father!

176
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,870
Congratulations.

177
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,990
Thank you.

178
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,180
We gave Hyeong-nim Man Su a proper burial.

179
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,310
I'm sorry, Hyeong-nim.

180
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,130
Not at all. What's important is that you returned safely.

181
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,450
Wow... so are you a nobleman now?

182
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,530
And our Cha Dol is going to be a young master too!

183
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,480
Cha Dol, you can't pretend to ignore me just because you're a young master now, all right?

184
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,090
Don't worry.

185
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,880
All right, all right.

186
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,980
But, wait...

187
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,050
This is such a happy day, but why do you look like that? Your expression is so dark.

188
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,900
Hey... Huh?

189
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,210
You're the same!

190
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,200
Has something happened behind my back?

191
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,080
W-wait Your Highnessâ€”

192
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,130
Hey Ba Wu, what are you doing?

193
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,380
Her highness is telling you to follow her!

194
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,370
What are you talking about? When did sheâ€”?

195
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,040
Ba Wu! The princess is waiting!

196
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,880
Hey, hey. Cha Dol. You can wait with me.

197
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,620
Court Lady Jo, let's prepare a festive table for them.

198
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,260
On a happy day like this, we might not be able to do anything extravagant.

199
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,290
But a humble serving of liquor perhaps?

200
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,120
Fine. They say even annoying affection is still affection.

201
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,310
A single farewell drink should beâ€”

202
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,770
What are you doing in front of the child?

203
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,990
Cha Dol! Let's go!

204
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,060
Hey, waitâ€”

205
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,210
She liked it too!

206
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:29,340
But wait... a farewell drink? Fareâ€” Hey, Court Lady Jo!

207
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,180
Isn't it cold?

208
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,200
It is fine.

209
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,300
Since your status has changed...

210
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,830
I suppose I can't talk down to you like this.

211
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,180
Just do as you always have.

212
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,960
There are rules for things like this.

213
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,640
I cannot do that, my lord.

214
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,050
You know I know nothing about rules or etiquette.

215
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,580
Moreover...

216
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,900
You suddenly sound like a stranger to me.

217
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,650
I don't want it.

218
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,340
Since we can't see each other like this anyway ...

219
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,890
or talk with each other for much longerâ€”!

220
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,930
So what is your name?

221
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,450
You must have a childhood name, right?

222
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,810
It is Su Gyeong, my lord.

223
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,140
"Su" from "water", and  "Gyeong" from "mirror".

224
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,950
Su Gyeong...

225
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,630
Yi Su Gyeong.

226
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,030
It's such a beautiful name.

227
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,450
But why the sudden interest in my name?

228
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,660
I don't want to remember you as the princess.

229
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm sorry.

230
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,890
About what?

231
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,310
For going out first into the sun alone.

232
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,600
I won't leave you in the shade for long.

233
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,510
Our temporary time apart...

234
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,980
is something we agreed was best for each other.

235
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,400
So don't blame yourself over it too much.

236
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,360
Have you heard what will happen going forward?

237
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,860
I heard that all of my confiscated properties would be returned to me.

238
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,090
Does that include your home in Hanyang?

239
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,870
Yes.

240
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,810
That is a relief.

241
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,820
Thank you.

242
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,320
It's all thanks to you.

243
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,020
Given how many times you've saved my life...

244
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,990
it's nothing at all, so please don't concern yourself over it.

245
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,010
When do you plan to leave for Hanyang, my lord?

246
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,460
I'm not sure.

247
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,940
I'm in no hurry, so I was thinking to take my timeâ€”

248
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,650
You cannot. You must hurry as quickly as possible.

249
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,200
It's obvious that the left state councillor will be glaring down your back, watching your every move.

250
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,980
Delaying things any longer could result in great troubles for you.

251
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,300
If it's because of me...

252
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,180
please don't fret over it.

253
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,060
When I heard...

254
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,880
the news about the restoration of your title...

255
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,200
I had already put everything aside.

256
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,490
What? We have to spend time apart for the time being?

257
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,950
Then... I can't go with you?

258
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,040
Do some thinking while you live.

259
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,900
Now that his status is reinstated, that councillor's eyes will become red from keeping a close watch on Cha Dol's father.

260
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,210
How can her highness the princess go to his house with him?

261
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,910
Ah then... we have to separate?

262
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,770
What did you hear thus far?

263
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,530
Fine. Then, I too will remain with you.

264
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,780
Are you crazy? Why would you stay with us? You should follow them.

265
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,920
Since Ba Wu is a nobleman now, he will live well without me.

266
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,880
But for you and the princess, I must remain.

267
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,920
Live well. You can live well without me, right?

268
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,990
Are you going somewhere?

269
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,930
Since you aren't here, I must watch over the princess and court lady Jo.

270
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,960
How can the two women live alone in this harsh world?

271
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,030
A man like me must remain steadfast like this.

272
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,380
- Forget it. 
 - Forget what?

273
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,380
- You don't need to do that. 
- Why?

274
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,060
What...?

275
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,010
We probably won't be separated forever, right?

276
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,590
No, this ungrateful man...!

277
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,950
How much hardship did Your Highness face because of him?

278
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,580
- And that dangerous road...!
 - Nanny,

279
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,790
I was rather volunteering it for my own sake.

280
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,430
Since everyone must be careful, we are temporarily staying apart.

281
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,010
So, don't blame that man.

282
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,440
Sister-in-law.

283
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:53,500
Young Master, I won't forget your grace in saving me.

284
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,790
No, I only did what I must do.

285
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,860
It probably wasn't easy to go against your father.

286
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,230
Thank you.

287
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,670
I didn't do it because of you.

288
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,780
It just resulted differently from what I intended.

289
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,310
Although not killing your father is a heavy grievance of mine,

290
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,210
since I can't live with debt unpaid ...

291
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,270
This is my repayment for saving my family.

292
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,120
This letter which was written to kill someone...

293
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,610
I felt that it can be used to save someone else.

294
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,250
Goodbye, Your Highness.

295
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,550
When I get settled in, I'll make sure to let you know quickly.

296
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,280
Yes. You stay well too.

297
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,430
Listen well to your father's words.

298
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,430
You must also study well and become a successful person.

299
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,840
Yes. You must stay healthy too.

300
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,590
Yes, I will.

301
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,670
You said they will see each other again soon anyway...

302
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,990
Why do things have to turn out this way? We all worked hard to get this far!

303
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,260
Does this fool still think himself a storyteller?

304
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,330
Don't cry. If we cry, Her Highness's feelings will hurt even more.

305
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,230
You are less sensible than Cha Dol...

306
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,110
Our Cha Dol is all grown up. He's all grown up.

307
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,410
Let's see each other again soon.

308
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,240
Well then...

309
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,260
Raise your head.

310
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,180
Your eyes are full of resentment.

311
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,500
Yes, you must be resentful.

312
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,800
You must hate your father to the end.

313
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,260
- But, Hwa In... 
- Hwa In is dead.

314
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,880
Since you wanted Hwa In dead,

315
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Hwa In is dead as you desired.

316
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,720
I understand how you feel.

317
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,860
But, how could I have wanted my one and only daughter to be dead?

318
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,450
I had to prevent the bloody wind from blowing again at court and save the country.

319
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,930
I had no choice, but to make that decision.

320
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,270
After abandoning you like that, I too shed tears of blood.

321
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,940
But before I was your father, was I not this country's royal leader?

322
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,430
I couldn't, because of my own affections, allow this country to fall into misery again.

323
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,320
I'm not saying this because I am hoping that you will understand.

324
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,660
It's definitely not to gain your forgiveness. I just...

325
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,600
Never mind. Seeing you safe like this is enough.

326
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,010
- Hwa In... 
 - I am Su Gyeong.

327
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,810
Since I have become Su Gyeong, I was able to live.

328
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,180
Please understand.

329
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,820
Do you remember why I gave you the childhood name of Su Gyeong?

330
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,120
Since you said that my inborn temperament was like fire.

331
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,770
I heard that you named me so that I would use water as a mirror and control myself.

332
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,960
That's right. I did.

333
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,650
Ever since you were a child, like a boy,

334
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,320
you liked shooting arrows and riding horses more.

335
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,780
 Father, I would really like to ride a horse.

336
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:44,390
 When you go hunting, can't you take me?

337
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,180
 - Hunting? 
 - Yes! Take me, Father!

338
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,880
 Really? Fine. Then, shall we start with practicing how to ride horses?

339
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,780
 Get on. I will leave.

340
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,990
 Your Majesty, her highness Royal Consort Yun has arrived.

341
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,090
 Tell her to come in! Are you all right, My Lady?

342
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,550
 If you run this slow, you will lose all the foxes and rabbits.

343
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,220
 - Hurry, hurry! 
 - All right, I will run faster.

344
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,620
 Run, run!

345
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,720
 Shall I go faster? What?

346
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,800
 Faster. Fast.

347
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,420
 Your father is going to get hurt. Get off now.

348
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,450
 - It's fine. It's fine. 
- Run, run!

349
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,520
 Aigoo, your father is going to die.

350
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,350
After all, you probably did follow me to a few of my hunts.

351
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,210
How did those fair hands become so rough?

352
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,570
It's all my fault.

353
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,900
It's your lacking father's fault. I'm sorry.

354
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,530
I will protect you from now on.

355
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,120
So that no one will ever harm you again,

356
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,590
your father will protect you.

357
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,390
Trust me this once.

358
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,220
I'm not saying this to princess Hwa In as a king.

359
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,790
I'm saying this to my daughter Su Gyeong as a father.

360
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,010
Will you trust and follow me?

361
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,490
I will make sure that you never shed a tear again.

362
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,350
I swear it upon this country's throne.

363
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,330
He wouldn't kill him just after restoring to him his status, would he?

364
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,090
I'm worried for Cha Dol's father too, but...

365
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,250
It worries me to death that he will drag her highness away.

366
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,260
That's a concern too.

367
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,290
Have you resolved some of the anguish in your heart?

368
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,080
Surely it can't be easy.

369
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,230
The young master has returned home.

370
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,220
Don't worry too much.

371
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,060
Since he is a hundred times better than his father, he will overcome this.

372
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,990
My royal father...

373
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,530
pledged to send a royal guard unit to the house we will live in.

374
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,100
- If perhaps you don't want it, you don't have to accept... 
 - Then...

375
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,960
We can go together?

376
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,420
We don't have to separate, isn't that right?

377
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,560
Father, I have committed a sin worthy of death.

378
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,110
But there was no other way to retrieve your letter.

379
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,960
If you are going to make an excuse, make it more plausible.

380
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,740
Does it make sense that you lied to both Father and me just to retrieve the letter?

381
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,750
Kim Dae Seok is not a pushover.

382
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,760
I had to deceive him completely in order to get the letter from himâ€”

383
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,170
Still you persist? You lied to father and you deceived me!

384
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,250
It's not just this time that you have acted against the interests of the family.

385
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,770
How can you blame all of this on the letter?

386
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,230
I can explain it all.

387
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,380
Father, please listen to my words.

388
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,350
Father!

389
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,000
Won Yeop, what on earth are you doing, not dragging him out this instant?

390
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,220
Please get up.

391
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,190
Stop.

392
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,660
Please stand aside. This is not something you should interfere in.

393
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,730
I will go inside for a moment.

394
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,160
Escort her to her quarters.

395
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,790
Let's go.

396
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,320
Do you have the confidence to take responsibility for whatever I say about that child?

397
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,260
What... does that mean?

398
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,790
Don't you know very well what I mean?

399
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,110
If you have the confidence to handle everything that will happen when I open my mouth,

400
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,510
then stop me.

401
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,680
Come inside.

402
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,160
Until your father gives the order,

403
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,580
you must not touch a single hair of this child.

404
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,730
Did something happen while I was gone?

405
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,260
I'm talking about our aunt.

406
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,100
What did her words mean?

407
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,770
- Shut your mouth! 
 - Hyeong-nim...

408
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,170
Didn't I say to shut your mouth?

409
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,220
So, are you saying that if I don't do what you ask, you will die?

410
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:54,230
If I die, will you even blink an eye?

411
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,060
Rather, isn't that what you want?

412
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,410
Be careful of your words.

413
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,200
Even if your heart is hurt because of Dae Yeop,

414
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,750
how can you say such reckless words?

415
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,970
Do you feel any compassion for me?

416
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,000
Has your heart ever hurt because of me, when I'm living like this?

417
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,230
You are my one and only younger sister.

418
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,930
Does that answer your question?

419
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,150
I will believe that it is true.

420
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,080
If you can't forgive Dae Yeop, cut me down here and now.

421
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,710
If I live to escape this room,

422
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,930
the whole world will know about Dae Yeop, that child.

423
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,300
Are you threatening me?

424
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,500
You threatened first, Brother!

425
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,770
If you would only forgive Dae Yeop, I promised to do everything.

426
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,350
I'd close my mouth and ears...

427
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,590
that I would live in silence as if I had died with the child, and so I pleaded with you!

428
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:31,340
But instead... it was you who asked me if I, therefore, wanted to die.

429
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,370
Do you even realize what that child has done?

430
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,710
Yes! I know.

431
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,920
I know everything regarding that child.

432
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,070
That child is the sole reason that I am alive.

433
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,810
How can I not know?

434
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:52,970
Then, you should know that this is regarding the safety of our family. And still, you are doing this?

435
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,920
If you want to keep our family alive,

436
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,840
forgive that child.

437
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,720
If I lose that child while I still live...

438
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:09,100
whether it's your family or secrets,

439
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,720
you ultimately won't be able to guard any of them.

440
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,970
So... if you can't forgive that child,

441
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,360
slash me first.

442
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,050
Stand up.

443
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,220
Follow me.

444
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,410
He didn't forgive you or accept you back.

445
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,470
He will have his eye on you even more strictly than before.

446
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,490
Do you understand what I'm saying?

447
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,140
Yes.

448
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,320
So go ahead and rest.

449
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,230
I'm sorry.

450
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,790
I only cause you worry. I am ashamed to face you.

451
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,190
Since there is a situation that I can't explain right now,

452
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,120
if you would just wait, I will explain it to you when the time comes.

453
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,100
I know that it's all because of the princess.

454
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,210
This is really the end.

455
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,580
If there is an issue regarding the princess again,

456
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,820
I will personally inform your father that the princess is alive.

457
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,690
- Aunt... 
- I can't bear to see you get hurt or ruined again because of the princess. Nayâ€”

458
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,270
It's not because of her. It's me ... I did this to herâ€”

459
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,890
Can't you shut that mouth of yours?

460
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,560
It's not too late to go your own way.

461
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,370
It's the only way that you and the princess will be able to live.

462
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,930
Keep in mind what I said.

463
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,020
What do you mean you can't return the house where Kim Je Nam lived?

464
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,440
There's someone else living there already.

465
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,170
They have demolished and rebuilt the house, so it's difficult to return it the way it was, Your Majesty.

466
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,780
As it happens, there is a vacant house near me.

467
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,510
I would like to give that house instead.

468
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,110
Would Kim Je Nam's grandson want to live in that house?

469
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,130
He would feel you are openly surveilling him.

470
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,960
I don't think it's fair to say I would be surveilling him.

471
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,300
Then, let's do this.  They need a place to live immediately.

472
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,610
Let them live in the house you described.

473
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,660
And I will send my personal guards to protect the house.

474
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,520
Then they can live with assurance, right?

475
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,190
I understand.

476
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,740
Also ...

477
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,320
I heard you have Kim Je Nam's daughter-in-law and granddaughter.

478
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,990
You will stick your nose in a jar of piss and fall into a bucket of dung.

479
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,650
We will see how well you churls eat and live.

480
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,490
What are you staring at?

481
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,220
Mother! Have decency, please.

482
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,370
Let's go.

483
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,720
Father, is that Grandmother's house?

484
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,790
No, now it is Cha Dol's house.

485
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,760
- It is your and your father's house. 
 - Wow!

486
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,690
It's great!

487
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,200
Father.

488
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,840
I am Kim Dae Seok.

489
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,790
These people are my household.

490
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,680
Let's go in.

491
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,590
 (Rather than saying "family" he literally says these are the mouths I feed.)

492
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,690
Mother! Mother! Brother is here!

493
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,210
What?

494
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,850
Dae Seok! Dae Seok!

495
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,970
Dae Seok. Dae Seok.

496
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:38,750
â™«  Please listen to me for  second.  â™«

497
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,700
If I died right now, I would have no regret.

498
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,840
â™«  Retrace your path and come here.  â™«

499
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,420
Let me look at my son's face.

500
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,170
Mother.

501
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,000
This unfilial son finally came to see you.  I am sorry.

502
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,530
That's not so. Thank you so much for being alive.

503
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,820
Thank you Buddha and the gods of heaven and earth.

504
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,320
â™«  You can't leave and come back again.  â™«

505
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,810
Dae Seok.

506
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,750
Mother. Stop now and let go of Brother.

507
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,630
I want to get a proper look at him too.

508
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:22,920
Brother...

509
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,010
It's been hard for you, hasn't it? I'm sorry.

510
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,190
Not at all. You are the one who suffered so much.

511
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:35,100
â™«  Winter leaves and a new spring is coming.  â™«

512
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,330
Who's this...?

513
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,130
My son Cha Dol.

514
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,510
Cha Dol. You must greet Grandmother and Aunt.

515
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,090
Grandmother, have you been healthy and at peace?

516
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,800
My puppy.

517
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,900
By the way, this is my mom.

518
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,160
â™«  The sound of excitement flows.  â™«

519
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,410
â™«  It is us, living life.  â™«

520
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,060
I see.

521
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,700
And the ones over there?

522
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,750
I am a longtime friend who has shared life and death, joy and sorrow with your brother.  And this one here is my wiâ€”

523
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:30,830
I am someone who has been like a sibling to Cha Dol's mother.

524
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,710
Please call me Yeo Ju Daek.

525
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,130
Mother, we shouldn't be doing this in the yard. Let's go in. Receive my bow first.

526
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,250
All right.  Come here, Cha Dol.

527
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,450
Let's go in.

528
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,470
Excuse me, Lady ... Yeo Ju Daek.

529
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,370
Let's take a look around the house.

530
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,400
It's all right. Take a look.

531
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,320
How did you meet Cha Dol's father?

532
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,750
I told you we met by chance.

533
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,300
How old are you? Where are you from?

534
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,660
Are your parents alive?

535
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,400
How is your family?

536
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,360
What are you so curious about?

537
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,300
Can we take our time to get to know each other?

538
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,450
It's about bringing a new person into the family.

539
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,070
Why don't you step out?

540
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,920
Motherâ€”

541
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,700
I was born in the year byeongo* in Hanyang, but my family clan is from Jeonju. 
  (1606)

542
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,400
I became an orphan when I was young, so I don't know about my family, Mother.

543
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:18,320
You must have had a hard time since you were alone from the time you were a child.

544
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
Not at all, Mother.

545
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,320
How could I compare myself to the hardship you and Agasshi have suffered?

546
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,050
Well, let's just say that's so...

547
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,820
As you can see, our family is not an ordinary family.

548
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,270
Now that you have become a daughter-in-law to this family,

549
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,950
you must be mindful of your behavior.

550
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,110
Do you understand?

551
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,080
Yes.  Bearing in mind what you have said,

552
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,410
I will make sure to not bring trouble upon this family.

553
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,660
How-How did it go?

554
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,700
- We've overcome the hurdle safely. 
 - What a relief.

555
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,700
- Everyone needs to be careful. 
 - Oh, don't worry.

556
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,150
Starting with what you say.

557
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,780
I knew this would happen.

558
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,610
Let's go prepare dinner.

559
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,630
- What? 
 - Wait a minute.

560
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,950
Why... sir?

561
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,500
I don't intend to have anyone else in the house from now on.

562
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,690
If I did, undoubtedly Yi I Cheom will try to plant his men here.

563
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,150
Or I suppose he'd try to seduce them with money.

564
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,100
You're right, you're right. Now that you mentioned it, Kim Ja Jeom's servants accepted bribes to spy on him.

565
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:34,860
So... I know this might be hard work, but if Court Lady Jo would...

566
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,140
Yeo Ju Daek.

567
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,010
I would like Yeo Ju Daek and Hyeongnim to take care of the housework.

568
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,200
- But ... 
- Don't worry!

569
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:49,090
A long time ago when I was a servant, I was such a great worker that I was paid twice the annual pay.

570
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,480
Is there anything you have never done before?

571
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,160
Let us go.

572
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,930
What haven't I done?

573
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,790
I never dreamed I could sleep in a silk blanket with an embroidered pillow.

574
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,380
It still feels like a dream.

575
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,870
Mother, should I have my wedding again?

576
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,150
Please let me have it again!

577
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:23,340
I want to wear a wedding coronet, have traditional purity dots painted on my face in a proper wedding hall!

578
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:29,800
Her outer appearance has all of the makings of a high-class daughter.

579
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,660
Who? My sister-in-law?

580
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:39,720
You're right. It's possible she received some lessons from Orabeoni before coming here.

581
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,480
She was exceptionally good at playing a noblewoman.

582
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,760
It doesn't matter. They say a dog's tail will never become a mink's fur.

583
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,720
As I thought. Like mother, like daughter, we think alike.

584
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,880
To be honest...

585
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,450
I also disliked how pretentious she sounded.

586
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,110
- Um. 
 - Um.

587
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,130
Oh... you speak first.

588
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,130
Shouldn't we give your mother her nightly greetings?

589
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,890
We could talk to her in the morning. A nightly greeting is excessive.

590
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,010
Isn't this our first night taking care of her as a family?

591
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,770
I wanted to prepare her bed and get her some water to drink at night,

592
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,300
but she seemed uncomfortable with me...

593
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,400
She's not uncomfortable with you. This is just...

594
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,560
her first time seeing you, so things are a little awkward, that's all.

595
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,450
So there's nothing to worry about.

596
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,920
And her bed and water will be taken care of by Yeon Ok.

597
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,380
Still... shouldn't we at least wish her a good night?

598
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,040
How could I not be worried?

599
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,840
As you said, your brother probably met her when he was yet a commoner,

600
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,020
so she is probably a low-class woman as well.

601
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,890
We'll just have to live with her.

602
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,760
Cha Dol is already grown so much. What can we do about it now?

603
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,360
You frustrating child!

604
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,620
I'm doing this because of Cha Dol, don't you see?

605
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,020
What about Cha Dol?

606
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,960
It's not like he'll have "my mother is a peasant" written on his forehead.

607
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,540
Child, if his mother is of common birth,

608
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,730
don't you realize he can't get a position at court?

609
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,800
You're right! Then Cha Dol can't receive court rankings either!

610
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,560
Don't you know what kind of household we are?

611
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,060
It makes no sense for a common child to continue our bloodline.

612
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,290
And even if it did, I cannot allow it.

613
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,360
Then... Orabeoni can just marry another woman.

614
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,050
Don't even dream it!

615
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,590
According to whom should I marry again?

616
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,720
How dare you raise your tone at me!

617
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,120
Even if you spent so many years as a peasant.

618
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,320
Please do not speak in this way.

619
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,780
Nobody is born a lowly commoner because they want to be.

620
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,110
Even for you, me, or Yeon Ok. Did we become commoners because we wanted to be?

621
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,470
Well we didn't. We didn't, but...

622
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,160
if Sister-in-law is of common birth, so is Cha Dol.

623
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,640
Watch your mouth. Cha Dol will overhear you.

624
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,200
- Cha Dol's father!
 - Mother!

625
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,940
You also should never again even dream of marrying me off a second time.

626
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,760
Sister-in-law sure must be as great as she looks.

627
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,690
Even if he was head over heels for his wife, discretion is still a thing.

628
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,240
How could he act that way in front of Mother from the very first day!

629
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,880
About my mother and sister...

630
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,350
Let's talk inside.

631
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,480
I'm sorry.

632
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,260
No, it's fine.  From her perspective,

633
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,930
that was something she was totally entitled to thinking and saying.

634
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,820
Even if it wasn't... faking my identity

635
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,040
and even lying that I was Cha Dol's mother is all my fault.

636
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,150
Why is that your fault? It's mine.

637
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,170
No matter whose fault it was, I must now live serving

638
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:30,060
your mother as this household's daughter-in-law.

639
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,800
So from now on, don't disobey her

640
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,740
or do things that cause her to be upset.

641
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,490
I think things will continue to be this way going forward.

642
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,110
Can you handle it?

643
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,180
Don't worry about it.

644
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,100
At least now I have someone protecting me by my side, don't I?

645
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,550
â™«  On a night darkness swallows  â™«

646
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,290
Thank you.

647
00:57:54,290 --> 00:58:00,510
From now on, don't get involved in the relationship between your mother and me.

648
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,120
I will do that.

649
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:09,200
â™«  Even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds  â™«

650
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,020
What is this?

651
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:20,140
â™«  On a night when even the wind sleeps silently  â™«

652
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,760
Since I haven't formally congratulated you, I've prepared this.

653
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,870
 That man is a bait. A bait to lure in Yi I Cheom.

654
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,770
Carefully watch Yi I Cheom.

655
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,060
As soon as he bites the bait, we must immediately reel him in.

656
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,600
If things go awry, only the bait will be lost.

657
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,180
He won't accept the servants?

658
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,580
Yes. The royal escort guard is there,

659
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,590
making it difficult to keep him under surveillance, so I thought of planting some people in the house.

660
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,490
But he wants possessions instead of servants.

661
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:11,750
It seems that he is definitely hiding something.

662
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,360
You look dashing.

663
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:40,980
But ... what is that book?

664
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,910
You haven't forgotten about the examination, have you?

665
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,850
Are-are you hurt?

666
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:12,310
That is not it. I sewed the tying ribbon backward.

667
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,730
Ah, I thought...

668
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:18,600
Since you keep watching, I am conscious of your glance, that's why.

669
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,660
What do you want me to do when I can't help but look?

670
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,250
The big exam is right around the corner. What are you going to do?

671
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,910
Don't worry.

672
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,440
The Art of War, the Works of Mencius, and the basic studies, I've already read them all.

673
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,820
I just have to look at this Code of Laws and I'm done.

674
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,870
The Confucian classics are probably not the important part.

675
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,940
What about the martial arts? You said that you've never used a rifle.

676
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,780
Ah...

677
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,440
Ah?

678
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,390
Don't tell me "Ah" at a time like this...

679
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,770
If you are that concerned for me,

680
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,590
can you personally teach me?

681
01:00:54,650 --> 01:01:00,210
Widen your stance to the width of your shoulders and straighten your back.

682
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:04,400
Stick the gun against your shoulder, then fasten it with your cheek.

683
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,030
After you aim towards the target, you must shoot.

684
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:17,930
The most important thing during this part is that your head and arms must not shake.

685
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,310
Try to shoot again.

686
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,020
Straighten your back and lower your arm.

687
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,630
After putting your wrist to your mouth,

688
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:46,050
Hold your breath and shoot.

689
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,420
Don't worry about it. It doesn't seem too hard.

690
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,420
This was a mistake!

691
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,240
It probably wasn't a mistake. It's your skills.

692
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:05,320
Then, why don't you show me your skills?

693
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,240
â™«  You are the one still lingering in my mind  â™«

694
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,650
Straighten your back and lower your arm.

695
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,390
After putting your wrist to your mouth, hold your breath.

696
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,390
â™«  Whatever I might have done  â™«

697
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,860
That was a mistake. A mistake.

698
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,150
Did someone say anything?

699
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,730
That was really a mistake.

700
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:27,620
Since my hands are frozen, I lost track of the arrow. I will try once more.

701
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:31,500
â™«  The hand which held me  â™«

702
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,780
Why are you doing this?

703
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,060
What are you going to do if someone sees us?

704
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,340
Why does it matter?

705
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,780
Stay still. I will thaw your hands.

706
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:46,730
â™«  Gently caught in my collar, my collar  â™«

707
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:51,560
â™«  it hurts  â™«

708
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,310
My hands are also cold, so it's no use.

709
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,180
It's fine.

710
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,090
â™«  The name, the warmth  â™«

711
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,730
Just until your hands melt, let's do this.

712
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,350
â™«  Your touch  â™«

713
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:43,650
â™«  They say that itâ€™s life  â™«

714
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,840
â™«  But todayâ€™s not the only day where things donâ€™t go your way  â™«

715
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,230
â™«  Like the stones that roll around on the ground  â™«

716
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:59,170
â™«  This day that is filled with scars is on its way out  â™«

717
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:04,700
â™«  Iâ€™m an angular stone  â™«

718
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,220
â™«  I won't stop   â™«

719
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,560
â™«  Iâ€™m rolling like a stone  â™«

720
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,580
â™«  Even though there are many angles  â™«

721
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,930
â™«  Iâ€™m rolling like a stone  â™«

722
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:30,680
â™«  Where should I go tomorrow?  â™«

723
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,820
Bull's eye!

724
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,600
Bull's eye!

725
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,540
Bull's eye!

726
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,420
Bull's eye!

727
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,550
Bull's eye!

728
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,430
Bull's eye!

729
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,090
You have until the incense burns out

730
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,600
to fire three shots.

731
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,780
During the rifle shooting test,

732
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,060
disguise it as an accidental firing and shoot Kim Dae Seok.

733
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,900
It shouldn't be difficult for you, who used to be in the special unit chasing dangerous tigers.

734
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,780
If you just kill Kim Dae Seok,

735
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,760
all of this money is yours.

736
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,810
If you just kill Kim Dae Seok, I will become your support and I will guarantee your success.

737
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,070
 Kill Kim Je Nam's grandson.

738
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,970
 Then, I will forgive you and accept you.

739
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

740
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,430
Fire the shot!

741
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:25,080

742
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,900
â™«  There is nowhere for my heart to rest  â™«

743
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,060
 Just until your hand melts,

744
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,180
 Let's do this.

745
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,110
â™«  Another day passes  â™«

746
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:40,050
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

747
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,820
 Minister of Defense, you must question the culprit and find out if there is someone behind this.

748
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:50,120
 I think we should petition for the crown prince to start a regency.

749
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,150
 To the left state councillor's house? Are you perhaps planning to go yourself?

750
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,370
 I am sure it came with a smuggling boat.

751
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,290
 Why is that man here...?

752
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:00,710
 There is no better weapon than Princess Hwa In to oust Yi I Cheom.

753
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:05,930
 Just as you protect me, I will do whatever it takes to protect you.

754
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:12,350
 Don't think that the king will protect you to the end.

755
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,250
 Be careful of His Majesty.

756
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,830
 We have a big problem, we do! That man has come!

757
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:20,130
â™«  Even for a day  â™«

758
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,030
â™«  Everything we did together  â™«
