1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,450
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,640
 Kwon Yuri

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,180
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,950

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,110
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,010
You are hungry, aren't you? I will untie that for you right away.

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,770
But ... haven't we seen each other somewhere?

8
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,650
No, we did.  You look very familiar.

9
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,000
Her Majesty the princess...

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,980
Hey, son!

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,230
I knew you would do this.

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,480
I'm going to go crazy. My father is really helpless.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,650
Father, isn't your dream too big?

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,330
In our situation, is a princess suitable for us?

15
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,830
Did you eat something wrong? Why are you talking nonsense?

16
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,680
You didn't know? This ahjumma is Her Majesty the princess.

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,040
What Majesty?

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,440
Her Majesty the princess at the temple...

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,190
See... I told you that I saw Her Highness the princess before!

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,810
This ahjumma is the princess!

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,500
   Princess!  Princess!  Princess!

22
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,780
What... the... ?

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,270
Father.

24
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,850
 Episode 2

25
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,820
I've confirmed it many times.

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,310
Not a single ornament or piece of jewelry is missing.

27
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,650
Has there been anything strange about my daughter-in-law lately?

28
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,390
No.

29
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,400
Did she behave in any unusual ways or meet anyone suspicious?

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Not even something like that?

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,200
What do you mean by that question?

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,490
It is for her safety and security.

33
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,300
So you must answer me without hiding anything.

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,420
She spent her entire life in the palace.

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,030
After coming to this house following her marriage, exactly once a year,

36
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,820
she goes to Sangwon Temple and that is the only time she ever travels outside.

37
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,660
We must inform His Majesty.

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,730
That won't do. It could damage my daughter-in-law's pure reputation.

39
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,840
- But still— 
 - If we're not careful,

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,940
everyone in Joseon will find out about this.

41
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,210
Then what do you think will happen?

42
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,740
Then everyone is Joseon will question her virtue.

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,260
Do you think she can endure such disgrace?

44
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,880
My judgment was short-sighted.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
I will make sure to find her.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
So please just wait and trust me.

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,530
- What happened? 
 - We searched everywhere nearby, but we have found no trace of her.

48
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,080
I am sorry. I looked everywhere that she might be, but—

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,420
Let's go inside. Dismiss anyone who is around.

50
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,640
Seeing how nothing is missing, it's not a common thief.

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,060
It appears to be the act of someone who has a grudge against our family.

52
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,510
Your thoughts are valid, but that leaves too many possibilities.

53
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,000
There are too many families that I have destroyed.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,770
The seeds of the Southerners are dried up. So it must've been the deeds of the Westerners*. 
  (Seo-in or Western political faction)

55
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,310
The Westerners?

56
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,410
I don't think they would do that.

57
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,350
Why would they abduct Sister-in-law unless they've gone crazy?

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,590
Of course, if His Majesty finds out,

59
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,630
their families are sure to be destroyed.

60
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,750
So they probably would not have committed this rash act.

61
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,920
Perhaps someone intended to harm her ladyship,

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,360
and try to frame you with that, Lord?

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,090
Father.

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,670
- You keep looking into the thugs. 
 - Yes.

65
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,440
- I have two trustworthy officers among my men. 
 - No.

66
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,650
No matter how trustworthy they may be, they are still outsiders.

67
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,540
Unless things become more urgent,

68
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,210
we must solve this among only family members.

69
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,620
Yes, I understand.

70
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,780
You go to Icheon and summon the private army.

71
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,490
Huh?

72
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,750
If I bring our private army into the capital city, won't that be misunderstood by others?

73
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,880
Misunderstandings can be explained.

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
But if we cannot find your sister-in-law,

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,860
and something terrible happens,

76
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,470
then what will you do?

77
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,290
Make sure to find her.

78
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,100
Our family's fate depends on this matter.

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,310
Are you really the king's daughter born from a concubine?

80
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,310
I will ask you again.

81
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,430
Are you a princess or not?

82
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,040
Yes.

83
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,910
I'm sorry about this.

84
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,900
I wasn't trying to bossam you, but somehow...

85
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,470
Just know that this wasn't intentional.

86
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,260
I will undo your gag because you seem like you have something to say.

87
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,630
But please don't scream. Understand?

88
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,880
Yes.

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
Untie me immediately.

90
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,220
I understand your situation, so untie me.

91
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,280
Then I will forgive you for your sin.

92
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,970
Is that all you have to say?

93
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,290
Untie me this instant—

94
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,840
Hold on.

95
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,120
I must go to the outhouse.

96
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,760
To pee? Or to poo?

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,380
How dare you! Who are you to say such insolent things?

98
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,990
I told you, that was insolent.

99
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,460
Relieve yourself well.

100
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,840
Why did you come out?

101
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,000
Why?

102
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,130
- She's taking care of her business. 
 - What business?

103
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,080
I thought a princess doesn't use the chamber pot.

104
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,990
- But what will you do now? 
 - I don't know.

105
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,760
How can you not know, Father? You have to think of something.

106
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,270
This could become a disaster.

107
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,430
I know that, boy. I just have to finish things off well, don't I?

108
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,040
But how?

109
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,890
- Well. 
 - I'm going crazy.

110
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,120
Because of you, Father, I'm getting old.

111
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,030
You're acting up again.

112
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,530
I'm going to meet Chun Bae, so guard her well.

113
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,260
But really, the princess pees?

114
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,700
I hate being unmarried. So sick of it.

115
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,800
Ba Wu, about that woman.

116
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,940
We went through so much trouble to abduct her.

117
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,360
How about taking her to some other man?

118
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,110
I'll look into a good candidate.

119
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,920
But is she pretty?

120
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,700
Is her being pretty or not important right now?

121
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,030
Of course it is.

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,260
Should I take her as my wife?

123
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,760
Stop saying dogcrap right now.

124
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,820
So she is pretty, huh?

125
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,930
Do you want her for yourself?

126
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, really... I ought to...

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,420
Hey, it's a joke. Can't I even make a joke?

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,190
If we can't, you can just take her back where she was.

129
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,050
Don't worry, don't worry.

130
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,710
We can just take her back, and it there won't be a problem.

131
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,660
See? It's totally quiet.

132
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,550
Who are those people? They aren't here to capture us, are they?

133
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,950
Father.

134
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,980
- What happened? 
 - I urgently summoned the cavalry

135
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,220
and the private army will arrive soon.

136
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,760
Should I have the Westerners followed?

137
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,820
- Your Excellency. 
 - Come in.

138
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,650
I received a message that you should go to the palace.

139
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,690
His Majesty is urgently asking for you.

140
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,480
- For what matter? 
 - I don't know.

141
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,970
The message only said that he is urgently asking for you.

142
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,970
What if His Majesty is looking for Sister-in-law?

143
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,600
 King Gwanghae

144
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,370
Do you see this?

145
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,000
It is an appeal to release  Seo Gung. 
   (Queen In Mok, king Gwang-hae's stepmother).

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,550
What do you think of it?

147
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,820
You should expel Seo Gung from the palace.

148
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,710
I told you that expulsion is not enough, didn't I?!

149
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,480
Seo Gung is a sinner who used her father to try to dethrone Your Majesty.

150
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,100
And so I killed her father, Kim Je Nam and the young prince Yeong Chang.

151
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,430
So now do you want me to become a son who kills his own mother?

152
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,590
If we leave Seo Gung alone,

153
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,900
she will collude with those with unpredictable loyalties

154
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,270
and is sure to bring trouble, Your Majesty.

155
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,290
Conspiracy! Conspiracy! These damned conspiracies!

156
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,840
So this is why you summoned your private army?

157
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,250
Fine. So who do I have to kill now?

158
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,000
Who should I kill?

159
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,070
Please speak! Who?!

160
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,420
I've spoken harshly.  Please forget about this.

161
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,880
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

162
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,820
How is Hwa In*? 
   (princess Su Gyeong)

163
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,230
As you wished, Princess Hwa In

164
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,020
is doing well.

165
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,780
I heard that it was my son-in-law's death anniversary a few days ago.

166
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,710
Why haven't you spoken of it?

167
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,550
Am I mistaken about something?

168
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,030
No, your grace is immeasurable.

169
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,610
That you would care to know of the death anniversary of my incompetent child,

170
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,510
moved me so much that I could not speak.

171
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,960
He is my son-in-law, after all.

172
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,210
I should have taken greater care earlier.

173
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,020
I have given orders that we must make sure to observe the death anniversary next year.

174
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,060
So please don't feel too upset.

175
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,970
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

176
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,660
And please tell Hwa In to come to the palace tomorrow, because The Royal Consort Yun wants to see her.
  (her mother)

177
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,950
Why do you look so surprised?

178
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,280
Is there something else going on?

179
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,060
No, your request is so sudden, that is all.

180
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,660
Her mother lamented so much that her son-in-law's death anniversary passed without her knowing it.

181
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:25,330
After thinking about it, I blamed myself for being too careless towards my only daughter.

182
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,590
So I thought I would take this opportunity to see her in person.

183
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,190
Would you like some?

184
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,670
I'm all right. You can eat it.

185
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,730
You don't have to save face.

186
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,790
Your reputation doesn't feed you, after all.

187
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,190
I'm really all right.

188
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,020
My father said that there is nothing sadder than being hungry.

189
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,730
So please eat some.

190
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,900
Hurry now.

191
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,160
Is it because it's dirty as I've already eaten some?

192
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,720
No.

193
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,250
What do I do? There is no more rice left.

194
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,280
Should I cook another pot of rice?

195
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,020
No.

196
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,990
I will eat it, so give me a spoonful.

197
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,220
How do you like it?

198
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,210
It's delicious.

199
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,300
It's spring parsley, aster, and bracken.

200
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,650
I picked and dried them myself.

201
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,850
And I grew the sprouts myself, too.

202
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,480
You are praiseworthy for doing such things while so young.

203
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,550
Gosh, no.

204
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,330
What is your name?

205
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,560
I am Cha Dol   (little stone)  because I am Ba Wu  (boulder) 's son.

206
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,990
My father's name is Ba Wu...

207
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,220
He told me not to tell you.

208
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,290
It's all right. I promise you that I won't tell anyone.

209
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,640
Thank you.

210
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,810
You don't have a mother?

211
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:09,330
I don't. I heard that she ran away after falling in love with my father's friend.

212
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,140
Please also keep this a secret from my father.

213
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,010
Father thinks that I don't know about it.

214
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,330
I understand. I will promise you again.

215
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,490
If I untie you,

216
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,290
you won't run away, will you?

217
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,780
If you promise to not run away,

218
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,890
I will untie your hands.

219
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,530
It's uncomfortable to eat with your hands tied up.

220
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,360
Weren't they the head and deputy head of the Office of Special Advisors? 
   (The king's political advisors who oversaw the royal library)

221
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,720
If you are curious, please look.

222
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,500
No, it's fine.

223
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,470
It seems to be an appeal to the king. Is it all right for you to do that?

224
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,360
I was requested to submit this appeal without your knowledge, Your Excellency.

225
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,180
But since you found out, isn't that request now useless?

226
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,120
The topic is already obvious to you

227
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,820
and you already know what's written, isn't it why you didn't look at it?

228
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,390
The head of the Office of Special Advisors told me

229
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,040
that they tried to submit another appeal to have Seo Gung released from confinement,

230
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,310
and he stopped them. So, I knew about their attempt already.

231
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,620
Of all things that go on in the palace,

232
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,130
there is nothing that escapes Your Excellency's notice, I heard.

233
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,700
That appears to be true.

234
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,680
People say such things? I've heard otherwise.

235
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,200
If one is curious about what the king is thinking,

236
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,190
they say that one should ask Court Lady Kim.

237
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,650
So I am curious about something.

238
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,620
His Majesty suddenly says that he wants to see Princess Hwa In.

239
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,870
And asked for her to come to the palace.

240
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,740
So I wonder if something is going on.

241
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,190
Since you suddenly asked to see me, I was anxious that something was going on.

242
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,190
But is that all you were curious about?

243
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,540
I was also wondering if you and I still had the same opinion regarding Seo Gung.

244
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,330
So I wanted to ask about that, as well.

245
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,550
Regarding Seo Gung, you probably already know without me saying anything more.

246
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,340
And regarding Princess Hwa In,

247
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,140
of course he asked her to come to the palace because he wants to see her.

248
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:36,090
After all, she is his daughter, whom he treated preciously, like a gem.

249
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,210
Why not just bring her to the palace?

250
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,910
So I can't imagine why you would be curious about that.

251
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,530
Has something happened to the princess, by any chance?

252
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,100
How can that be?

253
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,050
He suddenly asked to see her, when it wasn't a special occasion.

254
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,150
So I was curious to see if something was going on, that is all.

255
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,670
But about the appeal to release Seo Gung from her confinement...

256
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,980
What you may have seen or heard, anything is fine.

257
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,970
To anyone who tells us useful information

258
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,620
or brings it to us, I will give a fitting reward.

259
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,570
What? Her Highness the Princess?

260
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,780
What terrible luck!

261
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,940
What kind of mess is this?

262
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,950
What will you do now?

263
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,530
Yes. Drink up.

264
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,590
I'm sure your insides are burning up right now.

265
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,610
I've been doing this for ten years and have seen all sorts of things.

266
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,340
But a princess? Can't believe this...

267
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,010
Should I kill her?

268
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,190
Even you, the biggest scum on the earth, are scared. Babbling such nonsense.

269
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,190
Do you mean that? You must have gone mad.

270
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,990
How will you deal with the aftermath? Never mind that.

271
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,830
Can you even kill someone?

272
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,900
That isn't something just anyone can do.

273
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,490
Come to your senses. You may have lost your mind, but come on.

274
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,090
You shouldn't even dare to speak of such things.

275
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,100
So what do we do?

276
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,470
If we get caught, we are all dead. Don't you know that?

277
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,900
But even so.

278
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,510
What did that woman do wrong?

279
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,180
Hey, they're looking for us, aren't they?

280
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,990
What do we do?

281
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,970
Did you say 'bossam?'

282
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,880
Yes. They say there has been many bossams recently.

283
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,090
There are people who get hired to do that.

284
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,050
And they say that it's probably the work of those people.

285
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,340
- So people actually do bossam for money? 
 - Yes.

286
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,290
The truth is that we've also received reports of bossam at our station,

287
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,070
so we've begun investigations.

288
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,630
I asked the officers in charge about the details.

289
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,720
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

290
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,980
They typically target young widows

291
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,090
and there are so many widows after the Japanese invasion, so business is booming.

292
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,840
So you believe that your sister-in-law became a target for those people?

293
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,560
Did you find out their identities?

294
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,990
Apparently the investigation hasn't gotten that far.

295
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,950
And I can't officially ask specific questions regarding our matter, so...

296
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,870
I am sorry.

297
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,530
Can you find out today who these people are?

298
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,000
I am trying to beat it out of the thugs.

299
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,260
Both the ones who do this work and their clients

300
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,360
are all very secretive.

301
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,880
So it will take some time to find that out.

302
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,130
Yes, I don't think it's likely that we can find out in just one or two days.

303
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,190
I will mobilize the officers

304
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,070
and try to track these people, so if you can give me a few days—

305
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,680
No.

306
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,200
We must find her by tomorrow, no matter what.

307
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,160
Has something happened in the palace?

308
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,850
Perhaps His Majesty...

309
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,680
He told me to bring her to the palace tomorrow.

310
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,600
What? And if we cannot find her by tomorrow,

311
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
what do you plan to do?

312
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,200
Let me help you with that.

313
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,130
It isn't easy, is it?

314
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,060
Let me try again.

315
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,110
Yes, one more time.

316
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,570
Oh, I missed.

317
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,110
Can you pick that up for me?

318
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,050
I guess I'm not very good at this.

319
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,680
Try it again.

320
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,010
This is quite difficult.

321
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,180
Why don't you try it?

322
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,470
Don't laugh.

323
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,010
This is a girls' game, you know.

324
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,460
I am so good at games where you throw sticks and stones, you know.

325
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,360
I know, I believe you.

326
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,050
I'm telling you the truth.

327
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,730
I told you that I believe you.

328
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,110
I already know that you are good at everything, Cha Dol.

329
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,230
But must you go?

330
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,580
Didn't you agree to be my mom?

331
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,180
My father speaks roughly

332
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,290
but he is a nice person.

333
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,310
He grumbles a lot

334
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,190
but he's not like that on the inside.

335
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,500
Of course, he detests pretty women because of my mom.

336
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,060
Hey!

337
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,770
Father!

338
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,790
I told you that pretty women are all wicked, didn't I?

339
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,480
- That's not what I meant. 
 - Quiet. Come here.

340
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,740
I asked him to untie me because I urgently needed to use the chamber pot.

341
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,330
So don't scold Cha Dol.

342
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,350
Wow, you even know his name?

343
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,240
- Get on your knees and raise your arms as punishment. 
 - Look here.

344
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,860
Now!

345
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,520
Yes.

346
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,520
- And you. 
 - Insolent!

347
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,490
I really do not trust women.

348
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,440
You can trust me.

349
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,600
But if I hear that anyone is looking for me and my son,

350
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,760
I'll start a rumor that every night, you and I—

351
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,040
Stop.

352
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,380
You know what I mean, don't you?

353
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,980
That will never happen, so you must not say such filthy things ever again.

354
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Filthy? Bulls**t. That's life, isn't it?

355
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,290
How dare you? I told you to stop.

356
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,510
Anyway, you should act wisely.

357
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,100
Why that hideous thing again?

358
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,360
This way, you won't know where this place is.

359
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,780
If we get caught, we will have to leave Hanyang.

360
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,890
So late at night ...

361
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,440
- Father, I'll be on the lookout. 
 - Hey!

362
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,220
Father... Father, Father!

363
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,180
Please wait here for a moment.

364
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,340
What should we do when there are so many people?

365
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,450
What do you mean by that?

366
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,040
We have to leave her here.

367
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040
What if no one knows and she dies?

368
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,260
Who is going to die?

369
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,060
Father... but still...

370
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,810
I'll find out what's happening.

371
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,950
Stay still and guard her, understood?

372
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,380
Thank you for coming.

373
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,370
Excuse me... who are you saying has died?

374
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,320
The daughter-in-law of this noble household, the princess, hung herself.

375
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,620
What...? She hung herself?

376
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,820
Yes. When I first heard about it, I was also very surprised.

377
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,360
Wow, but the royal family sure isn't like others.

378
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,690
I mean, even remaining a widow in this world is tough nowadays,

379
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,940
but she even followed her husband by hanging herself.

380
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,780
She is the most virtuous among all virtuous women.

381
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,430
I'm sure they will be awarded the red gate which praises a virtuous widow.

382
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,130
Your words are true, no need to say it twice.

383
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,870
- Right? 
 - Yes.

384
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,960
Father.

385
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,040
Father...

386
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,160
Father...

387
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,560
What's done is done.

388
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,700
Even though you say your loyalty is big and wide,

389
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,040
You can't revive someone who has already died.

390
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,630
What are you going to do?

391
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,820
Are you going to die like this?

392
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,630
Or will you take this money and live?

393
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,880
Untie her gag.

394
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,850
You will receive divine punishment!

395
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,200
Kill me instead.

396
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,550
Later, when the king learns of this,

397
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:32,250
he will make you pay the price for the grudge of the princess and mine as well.

398
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,610
Father...

399
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:45,010
Cha Dol, Cha Dol, Cha Dol!

400
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,160
Cha Dol, what happened?

401
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,970
Cha Dol.

402
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,430
Cha Dol, Cha Dol.

403
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,220
What happened?

404
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,930
Didn't you promise that you will take me back?

405
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,770
Is your mouth stuck together? Quickly say something!

406
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,280
Am I not asking what happened?

407
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,580
Cha Dol, did you join your father to deceive me?

408
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,510
Father...

409
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,730
What is your reason? Tell me right now.

410
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,480
You are already dead.

411
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,550
When I went in front of your house, they were already hosting your funeral.

412
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,020
Since we can't return someone who is already dead,

413
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,150
I had no choice but to come back.

414
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,650
I can't believe it.

415
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,480
How dare you speak such falsehoods? Tell me the truth.

416
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,610
You committed suicide because you could not forget your dead husband.

417
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,990
They said that your family will be awarded the red gate in praise of a virtuous widow.

418
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,000
That is all that I heard.

419
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,980
Why... are they hosting a funeral when she's alive?

420
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
There exists a sort of life where someone is alive but dead.

421
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,600
What's that?

422
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,960
First of all, get some sleep.

423
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,240
You too, Cha Dol.

424
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,050
Let's go to the palace.

425
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,960
I must see my father, the king.

426
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,380
Don't worry. I will petition my Royal father,

427
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,990
so that you won't be held accountable for your crimes.

428
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,940
I guess Cha Dol didn't tell you this.

429
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,990
What I trust even less than a pretty woman is the king.

430
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,930

431
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,040
Our Hwa In... I must see her face.

432
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,170
Please let me at least see her face.

433
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,270
This is the last wish of a mourning mother.

434
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,260
My poor child...

435
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,220
Please let me just see her face.

436
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,520
Your Highnesss, as you must have suspected,

437
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,910
she hasn't died peacefully,

438
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,000
it was hard enough for me to look at her body.

439
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,860
If you look at it, the trauma will be worse.

440
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,770
I am very worried that your health may suffer due to the shock—

441
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,500
It doesn't matter.

442
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,320
I want to see her. I must see her.

443
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,130
If you see her, it will be harder on you. Just send her away peacefully.

444
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,300
Rather than being seen in her final, damaged form,

445
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,170
she probably wants to be remembered by you at her best.

446
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,320
I told you that it doesn't matter!

447
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:09,010
It's not because I don't understand your feelings, Your Highness.

448
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,470
Although she may have been a princess

449
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,950
there are customs when it comes to funerals.

450
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,090
And her body was already washed and shrouded and put in her coffin.

451
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,290
Since you are asking to reopen the coffin,

452
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,210
I don't know what to do.

453
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,930
Your Majesty, I beg that you will hear us.

454
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,320
I beg that you will hear us!

455
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,300
Royal Consort,

456
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,300
Let's do as he says.

457
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,070
Even if you were to see her face now, she won't come back to life.

458
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,640
What's the use in that?

459
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,830
Your Majesty...!

460
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,640
Let's allow her to leave peacefully on her final path.

461
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,600
- Royal Consort! 
 - Your Highness! 
 - Royal Consort?

462
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,370
Your Highness!

463
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,660
As a king I should say her act is praiseworthy,

464
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,220
but as her father, I cannot hide my grief.

465
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,800
I did not understand the princess' feelings.

466
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,070
For my disloyalty which has resulted in such tragedy,

467
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,610
please punish me, Your Majesty.

468
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,270
No, she was your daughter-in-law, and therefore, your child as well.

469
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,150
I am sure that your grief is as great as mine, Left State Councillor.

470
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,070
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

471
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,610
I can't believe that she's dead, but what can I do?

472
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,120
I have to believe it.

473
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,100
I really can't believe it.

474
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,570
As her mother, I know her better than anyone.

475
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,300
She's not someone who would ever take her own life.

476
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,010
Your Majesty, you know very well what kind of temperament she had.

477
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,600
I just cannot believe this, Your Majesty.

478
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,990
Royal Consort, please calm down.

479
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,430
You will faint again like this.

480
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,970
Court Lady Jo... I have to see Court Lady Jo.

481
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,780
Yes, indeed. Why don't I see Court Lady Jo?

482
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,730
Where is Court Lady Jo? Please summon her.

483
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,570
That child...

484
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,500
Is it really true that she hung herself?

485
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,390
Why can't you speak?

486
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,170
Am I not asking if it is the truth?

487
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,660
It is the truth, Your Highness.

488
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,910
I couldn't believe it.

489
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,970
I wasn't able to believe it.

490
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,610
How could she be so harsh on herself?

491
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,540
What should this mother do, Hwa In...?

492
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,600
Oh, pitiful one...

493
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,950
Even God is cruel to her.

494
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,020
How hard must it have been on her...

495
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,020
How lonely must she have been...

496
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,690
It's all my fault.

497
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,230
I should have protected her.

498
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,720
She was never able to stand in a wedding ceremony, she became a widow while still a virgin

499
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,020
and sent to her marital home in a white palanquin*, and my heart was torn apart. 
 (for virgin widows)

500
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,030
My Hwa In! I allowed her to walk that final road by herself...

501
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,290
How lonely must she have been?

502
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,960
How scared must she have been ...?

503
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,930
Oh, Hwa In. Hwa In...

504
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,810
This is all due to my negligence!

505
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,950
Please kill me, Your Highness!

506
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,150
Oh, Son, what is happening?

507
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,260
Sweetie, come with your grandmother.

508
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,520
Do not forget that your mother and younger brother are alive because you kept your mouth shut.

509
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,610
And if you ever do open your mouth,

510
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:25,200
your mother and younger brother will die. Heed my words.

511
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,900
From today, you will live in Nae Byeoldang*
   (an annex building) .

512
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,560
You want me to serve Lady Haeindang instead of Her Highness the Princess?

513
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,480
Since the Princess you served died, isn't it natural?

514
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,700
Are you here?

515
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,540
What are you doing here, Sam Wol?

516
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,160
I received orders to serve Lady Haeindang starting today.

517
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,290
They aren't orders to serve Lady Haeindang

518
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,570
but to keep watch over me, probably? Isn't it?

519
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:43,340
I would also prefer to serve Young Master instead of Lady Haeindang.

520
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,780
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Young Master.

521
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,620
Young Master went to Hapcheon.

522
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,200
Perhaps he's arrived at Anseong by now?

523
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,630
We have to be on our way after having some hot bowls of rice and soup with a jug of wine.

524
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,150
Please give plenty of fodder to that horse over there.

525
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,310
I feel sorry for her, as she was so young.

526
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,080
But thanks to her, my back is suffering.

527
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,060
Why are you looking at me that way?

528
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,550
Seeing your appearance, you seem to be a herald. Is there some urgent news?

529
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,320
Yes. A report of death in the royal family.

530
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,940
So there is a tragedy in the royal family?

531
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,840
That's correct.

532
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,360
May I see that government dispatch?

533
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,500
Who are you to ask to look at that?

534
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,420
He is the esteemed son of His Excellency the Left State Councillor.

535
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,480
It's not illegal so please let him see it briefly.

536
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,800
After all, it's news that everyone in Hanyang knows already, isn't it?

537
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,210
And get yourself something to eat, while you're at it.

538
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,220
Well. Sure.

539
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,760
 His Majesty's daughter ...

540
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,280
Hey...

541
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,120
Is this really true?

542
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,770
What do you mean?

543
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,420
Is it true that Princess Hwa In really died?

544
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,710
Yes, I heard that His Majesty visited the Left State Councillor's home.

545
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,360
Young Master.

546
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,990
 I cannot let you go this way.

547
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,590
 Until I see it clearly with my own eyes, I cannot believe it.

548
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,890
 I will not believe it.

549
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,800
 I am coming. I am on my way.

550
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,940
 I cannot let you go like this. Never.

551
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,650
Father?

552
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,060
Your Highness the Princess?

553
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,190
Father.

554
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,380
Father?

555
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,970
Father??

556
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,650
Blame the fact that you are of royal birth.

557
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,320
Her face doesn't look like a prostitute.

558
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,980
Won't there be trouble later?

559
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,930
No trouble, but there is a flaw.

560
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,280
She lost her husband and baby in a war and lost her mind.

561
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,950
She will claim that she is a princess or something. Just ignore it.

562
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,400
So she's gone completely crazy, huh?

563
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,080
So I'll sell her for cheap. If she was sane, would I bring her here?

564
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,450
I would have sold her to a courtesan house instead.

565
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,920
But something still smells fishy.

566
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,860
You said you will leave Hanyang anyway.

567
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,040
Once you go to Hasam Island, it doesn't matter if there is trouble anyway.

568
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,360
Fine. How much?

569
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,300
How much do you need?

570
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,370
Three nyang. No discount.

571
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,400
Three nyang? That's all?

572
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,740
You better not take back that offer.

573
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,210
You're a dead person anyway.

574
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,590
Rather than staying faithful as a young widow, how about changing your life?

575
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,650
They say that being alive is better than death, even if you're rolling in a field of dogs**t, don't they?

576
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,580
I would prefer it if you just kept her with you instead of making her a prostitute.

577
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,230
Aside from her having lost her mind, you would never find a woman more beautiful than her.

578
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,770
That's up to me, so just take this and get lost.

579
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,990
No, don't take the money!

580
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,830
Father, you are bad.

581
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,280
She's my mom. Don't sell her.

582
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,160
Won't you take your hands off her now?!

583
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,990
I don't want to. I won't let go.

584
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,290
I won't obey you, Father.

585
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,620
This naughty boy!

586
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:18,020

Father...

590
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,240
Won't you pick it up right now?!

591
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:34,560

Go home ahead and wait.

610
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,490
What about you, Father?

611
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,790
I will meet Chun Bae and then come home.

612
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,590

Your skin is like silk.

620
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,950
So what treasure are you hiding in here?

621
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,150
Shall I take a look?

622
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,730
Stay still.

623
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,020
No matter what you do, there is no one coming to save you.

624

Except for me, that is.

Hey!

626
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,220
What?

627
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,740
Sorry. Let's say this never happened.

628
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,050
What the... ?

629
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,020
I told you that I'm sorry.

630
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,990
Are you joking around?

631
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,570
Hey, do you think you can mess with me?

632
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,820
This bastard...

633
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,160
I'm sorry about this.

634
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,280
It took me a little while

635
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,170
to make up my mind. I'm sorry.

636
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,340
I will take you to the palace or wherever else you want.

637
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,590
Let's just go home for now.

638

639
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,310
Dae Yeop.

640
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,990
Is Sister-in-law behind there?

641
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,510
How did you find out and come home already?

642
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,670
- What will you do? 
 - I must see her.

643
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,890
Without seeing her with my own eyes, I cannot believe this.

644
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,530
I cannot believe in anything.

645
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,300
What are you talking about now?

646
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,450
Get a hold of yourself.

647
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,990

648
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:08,990

649
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,480
What do you think you are doing?

650
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,990
Back away right now!

651
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,990
Father, I must see her.

652
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,030
Get this boy out of my sight right now!

653
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,590
Yes.

654
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,590
Court Lady Jo. Court Lady Jo!

655
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,410
Sister-in-law trusted and depended on you so much, Court Lady Jo.

656
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,200
So futilely and so pitifully...

657
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,800
how can you let her leave this world this way?

658
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,390
How can you?!

659
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,840
I've committed a sin punishable by death.

660
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,640
Please kill me.

661
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,650
Are you asking me to kill you?

662
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,810
If you die, will Sister-in-law who died—

663
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,020
Stop this now.

664
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,640
Aunt.

665
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,240
Could she be feeling less grief than you?

666
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,600
She raised the princess by breastfeeding her herself.

667
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,230
You may not know this,

668
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:31,200
but the two people who were the most beloved and precious to her while she was alive

669
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,510
were you and Court Lady Jo.

670
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,690
To see the two of you in conflict like this ...

671
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,450
My nephew's wife would not want that.

672
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,020
My nephew's wife, the girl I knew, wasn't someone who would do this.

673
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,650
I don't know how this could have happened.

674
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,990
I cannot accept or understand this, just as you cannot.

675
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,020
But it already happened. So what can we do?

676
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,840
So let's send her off in our hearts.

677
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,170
Dae Yeop.

678
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,430
Let's find closure.

679
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,940
Young Master.

680
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,300
Cha Dol.

681
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,860
Your Highness the Princess.

682
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,450
Cha Dol.

683
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,390
Father.

684
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,800
Go in and pack your things.

685
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,050
What things?

686
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,410
We will take the princess to the palace and leave Hanyang.

687
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,800
That way. There.

688
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:05,440
Actually, it's that way.

689
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,450
My Lady!

690
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,390
Ba Wu! Run away!

691
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,210
R-r-run!

692
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,220
Hurry!

693
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,300
Chase them!

694
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,940
Run away!

695
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,340
Get away!

696
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,090
Run away! Run away!

697
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,390
Get them!

698
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,520
Hurry.

699
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:02,990
Search thoroughly.

700
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,820
Yes!

701
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,880
Search.

702
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,050
Hold on.

703
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,890
This way.

704
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,230
Search everywhere. You must find and kill them.

705
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:27,390
Who are you?

706
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,670
Sister-in-law?

707
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,460
Brother-in-law.

708
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,540
Sister-in-law, are you having any difficulties?

709
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,110
How did you come here, Brother-in-law?

710
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,810
Stop.

711
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:09,810
 What I trust even less than a pretty woman is the king.

712
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,690
 How...

713
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,390
 How can you?!

714
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,450
 You are the cause of this situation.

715
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,240
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

716
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,550
 When my daughter-in-law is found, wherever it may be, and whoever sees, make sure to kill her.

717
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,690
 - Hey! 
 - Go. 
 - How can you expect me to run away by myself?

718
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,160
 Please just go!

719
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,990
 Once Her Highness the Princess enters the palace

720
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:36,620
 does that mean we will never see her again?

721
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:40,020
 She was always from a different world than ours.

722
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,970
 All pretty women are wicked, so don't get bewitched.

723
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,150
 Let's go to the palace as we first planned.

724
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,410
 Hold on.

725
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:50,730
 I put someone on this, so make sure to not lose her and take care of it thoroughly.

726
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:51,790
 You are...

727
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,690
 Please die, Your Highness the Princess.

728
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,250
 Your Majesty.

729
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,660
 Raise your head.

730
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,850
