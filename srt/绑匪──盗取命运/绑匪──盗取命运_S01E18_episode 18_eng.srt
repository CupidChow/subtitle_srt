00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,510
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,580
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,180
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,000

5
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,080
 Bossam

6
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,690
Your Highness, the Prince.

7
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,270
Forgive your sinful subject for taking so long

8
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,430
to reveal the truth.

9
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,510
You are the sole descendant of the person who rightfully should have been king.

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
  Episode 18

11
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,440
Your Highness is not my son...

12
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,830
You are the son of his highness prince Imhae, eldest son of the former king.

13
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,850
It must be difficult to accept,

14
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,160
but there is not one ounce of falsehood in what I have said.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,310
- Fatherâ€” 
 - I am not Your Highness's father.

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,630
Your Highness's father is his highness Prince Imhae.

17
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,620
His highness Prince Imhae unjustly died at the hand of the vicious present king.

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,120
And his sole descendant...

19
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,390
is Your Highness.

20
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,240
How could you be this cruel?

21
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,070
How could you be this unyielding?

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,390
I did not know you were such a merciless person.

23
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,190
You were the only person in this house who understood me and treated me warmly.

24
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,610
In reality you tricked your child and deceived the world.

25
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,430
But nevertheless, you can still smile at me,

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,550
as if nothing happened.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,880
I did not even dream you were such a frightening person.

28
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,730
Until when were you thinking of deceiving me?

29
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,760
My father...

30
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,580
Or should I call him my uncle now?

31
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,280
Had he not told me, would you have kept the truth hidden until your death?

32
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,920
Did you really not feel anything at all,

33
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,970
when seeing me daily in this house?

34
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,430
Did you not want to call me your son?

35
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,210
To say you are my mother?

36
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,410
On the day your father passed, I hanged myself in an attempt to die as well.

37
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,360
Since that day, the men your uncle assigned to guard me

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,930
never left my side for even a moment.

39
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,360
I could not even think of dying.

40
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,930
That is how I survived.

41
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,190
And I realized that the moment your ancestry was revealed,

42
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,720
you would die like your father.

43
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,480
I kept my own lips sealed.

44
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,100
Following that, every single moment I spent alive and breathing was hell to me.

45
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,930
I regretted it dozens, hundreds of times a day.

46
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,360
I resented the heavens, and your father who had left before me.

47
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,440
However,

48
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,230
I was happy not to be separated from you,

49
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,900
and to be able to breastfeed you.

50
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,760
This is the truth.

51
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,760
All that time, I could not call you my son even once,

52
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,210
and could not act as your mother.

53
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,480
But I was grateful

54
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,010
to be able to see you

55
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,190
and live together with you in the same house.

56
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,920
No matter what you say,

57
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,920
it does not change the fact that you have deceived me all this time.

58
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,630
Thus, do not say sorry

59
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,560
or ask for forgiveness.

60
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,610
I cannot forgive you until I die. No,

61
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,780
I will not forgive you even after my death.

62
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,150
 His Highness Prince Imhae unjustly died at the hand of the vicious present king.

63
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,670
 And his sole descendant...

64
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,080
 is Your Highness.

65
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,530
If you are awake, I will come in, Your Highness.

66
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,760
Please stay seated.

67
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
Please treat me as you used to.

68
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,730
I cannot do so.

69
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,920
I cannot treat Your Highness as I used to, when you are to ascend the throne in the future.

70
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,730
I have not even the slightest desire to be king.

71
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,740
Whether you want it or not,

72
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,690
the throne was always yours.

73
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,260
Had the present king not murdered the former king,

74
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,730
the throne would have naturally been inherited

75
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,550
by his eldest son, Prince Imhae.

76
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,450
I heard that the previous king had meant for Prince Yeongchang to ascend the throne.

77
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,550
Although the Western faction claimed as such,

78
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,330
Prince Yeongchang was a mere newborn then,

79
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,770
and the Ming Empire desired for Prince Imhae, the eldest son, to become king.

80
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,040
That is why the current king drove Prince Imhae to his death as a traitor.

81
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,960
If I say I am Prince Imhae's son after all this time, who would believe me?

82
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,210
There is a way to prove that Your Highness is Prince Imhae's son.

83
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,660
Prince Imhae's wife is still alive.

84
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,030
She will testify to Your Highness's identity.

85
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,060
Does that person know about me?

86
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,730
She does not know.

87
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,720
Then how...

88
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,760
If a pitiful woman living alone after being kicked out to her private home

89
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,060
is given a chance to be made into the highest position of the royal family as the queen dowager,

90
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,390
would she refuse such an opportunity?

91
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,820
I will depose the current king at all costs

92
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,950
and return to Your Highness the throne that was taken from you.

93
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,320
I do not need it.

94
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,620
Did I not tell you that I have not the slightest desire to become king?

95
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,480
I beg you to please leave me alone.

96
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:42,160
Because you are still confused, I will explain it again later.

97
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,690
Your Highness.

98
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,660
If you ascend the throne to be king,

99
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,260
you can even have Princess Hwa In.

100
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,190
Doesn't the saying go that there is no such thing as shame to the king?

101
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,290
You should give it thorough consideration.

102
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,610
Please leave. I have nothing else I wish to say or hear.

103
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,570
Dae Yeop.

104
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,580
'I'm sorry. Please forgive me.' I told you that I did not need such words.

105
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,720
It would be shameless of me to beg forgiveness from you.

106
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,480
But think about why your uncle is letting you know who your father is.

107
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,760
That worries me. It's a secret that was kept all this time,

108
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,700
so why would he tell you himself?

109
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,950
He says he will put me on the throne.

110
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,990
Did you just say 'throne?'

111
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,740
Why are you so shocked?

112
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,440
Prince Imhae was naturally the one who should have ascended to the throne

113
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,650
and I am his only child.

114
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,210
So isn't it only natural?

115
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,620
No, Dae Yeop. my brother only wants to use you as a tool to fulfill his own ambitions.

116
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,720
I don't care.

117
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,770
After all, I am just using my uncle to achieve my own goals as well.

118
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,010
Why are you doing this?

119
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,190
Did you lose your mind due to your resentment towards me?

120
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,170
Or are you doing this just to torture me?

121
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,870
You kept telling me that I could not be with her highness the princess until the very end, didn't you?

122
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,010
Why do you mention her suddenly?

123
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,480
And you know now why I opposed that relationship, don't you?

124
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes, her highness the princess is my first cousin now.

125
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,490
So it's not a relationship that can ever happen,

126
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,300
and must not ever happen, that is natural.

127
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,040
However, I will show you

128
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,680
that that notion is wrong.

129
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,530
Je-wang-mu-chi, they say. That a king has no shame.

130
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,310
So if a king wants to make his first cousin a consort, who would oppose it?

131
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,070
How can you speak of such an absurdity? Did your uncle say such a thing?

132
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,220
Just wait and see.

133
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,270
I will make sure to ascend the throne, and

134
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,810
make her highness my woman

135
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,360
and let her stay by my side for the rest of my life.

136
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,450
You will also become the queen dowager. I will make it so.

137
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,280
Do you think I want that position?

138
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,650
Even if you slash my throat with a blade, that will never happen.

139
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:27,740
Things in this world do not always go the way you want, do they?

140
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,900
Do you think I wanted to be born as your son, Mother?

141
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,650
That is a slap from your father, not from me.

142
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,410
You can resent me to death

143
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,550
and you don't have to forgive me until you die.

144
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,630
However, don't besmirch your father's name.

145
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,520
He died as a traitor, after all.

146
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,850
How dare you speak so carelessly when you know nothing?

147
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,480
Do you know how your father died?

148
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Whose fault was it that he died so unfairly...

149
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,740
What do you mean by that?

150
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,520
Are there more things I do not know?

151
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,800
No. While speaking of your father,

152
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,860
I lost my composure for a moment and misspoke.

153
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
Don't pay any attention to it.

154
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,710
But you must never trust what your uncle says.

155
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,340
Please calm down and think it over again.

156
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,770
It was something Dae Yeop would have found out someday.

157
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,810
Brother!

158
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,550
It's not as if I told him something that was not true. I just told him the truth.

159
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,240
How dare you raise your voice?

160
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,190
How is it the truth to tell him that you will put him on the throne?

161
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,930
Isn't it because you need a king that you can control however you want, Brother?

162
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,620
Dae Yeop is the only proper descendant who is qualified to ascend to the throne.

163
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,070
Whether I need him or not, he was born with the fate to sit on the throne.

164
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,880
So if he seats on the throne and does not act exactly as you want,

165
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,750
will you kill him too?

166
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,300
Watch what you say.

167
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,530
Please leave Dae Yeop alone.

168
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,060
You must never speak of the throne to him again.

169
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,120
So you will now dare to command your older brother?

170
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,390
If you try to use Dae Yeop again,

171
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,040
then the last secret that you have hidden

172
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,250
will become known to Dae Yeop.

173
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,890
The last secret?

174
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,750
Was there another secret besides the fact that you are his mother and Prince Imhae was his father?

175
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,490
I have no idea what you are talking about.

176
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,690
Have you forgotten

177
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,480
who killed his father?

178
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,150
Shall I tell him?

179
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,960
While Prince Imhae was in exile on Ganghwa Island,

180
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,250
wasn't it you, Brother, who sent assassins to assassinate him?

181
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,870
Are you threatening me right now?

182
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,740
Yes, I am.

183
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,360
To protect my child, what wouldn't I do, as his mother?

184
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:49,620
â™«  A bunch of faded Flame Grass  â™«

185
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,590
â™«  fills my heart in no time  â™«

186
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,680
 Why are you looking at me like that?

187
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
 You told me to sit still, didn't you?

188
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,540
â™«  I can't hold and look at them  â™«

189
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,310
 Lady.

190
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,930
 Insolent.

191
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,880
â™«  I only sigh and yearn  â™«

192
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,920
â™«  I will cut a day out  â™«

193
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,730
â™«  among the difficult days of my life  â™«

194
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:35,150
â™«  and fill it with someone's gentle breath  â™«

195
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:43,040
â™«  when I try to cope  â™«

196
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,510
â™«  Because I've heard  â™«

197
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:58,080
â™«  your voice calling me.  â™«

198
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,820
What is it? Do you have something to say?

199
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,120
I have something to tell you in secret. Follow me.

200
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,260
You are beating around the bush again.

201
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,050
So you failed, didn't you?

202
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,570
What's with the expression?

203
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,310
You failed to block your father's treacherous plot. Am I right?

204
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,630
Yes. I failed.

205
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,090
Oh, damn it.

206
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,430
I am sorry.

207
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,430
You don't have to be sorry.

208
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,800
You and I are in the same situation, after all.

209
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,960
Ah, such a moron!

210
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,270
I was speaking to myself.

211
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,340
Now that my status was restored to me and my life is a bit more comfortable,

212
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,960
I think I became arrogant.

213
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,870
I had a dream.

214
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,960
It was just a brief, one night's dream, but you and I had become friends

215
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,500
and we called each other "brother-in-law."

216
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,290
If I visited you, you would serve me wine as if it was natural.

217
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,070
You and I got into a brawl together at a gambling joint,

218
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,590
and we looked at each other's bruised faces while laughing.

219
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,170
Obviously a silly dream.

220
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,120
Perhaps it's not such a silly dream.

221
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,410
What are you saying? That you and I will become friends?

222
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,460
I'm just saying, we could be friends in our next lives.

223
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,050
You are a student of Confucianism, and you speak of reincarnation?

224
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,490
My current life feels like a never-ending hell to me.

225
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,730
How can you say that when you were born to a well-to-do father?

226
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,140
Right.

227
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,090
My father is quite well-to-do.

228
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,170
Quite a grand and powerful father, in fact.

229
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,810
The first thing is probably for your status reinstatement to be retracted.

230
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,010
And then her highness the princess will be targeted next.

231
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,310
You should run away before that happens.

232
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,150
Where no one can ever find you...

233
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,020
No, just leave Joseon altogether.

234
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,690
If you remain in Joseon,

235
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,110
you will only be used by my father or his majesty the king.

236
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,940
If I leave Joseon,

237
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,790
you will also never see the princess ever again.

238
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,310
Only if she can become happy,

239
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,370
then nothing else matters.

240
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:12,170
You may not know this, but since she was young, she was the most cheerful person in the world.

241
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,540
Bright and strong.

242
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,920
If it was possible, I would even trade bodies with you.

243
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,710
What's with you, all of a sudden?

244
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,570
Has something happened to you?

245
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,090
If you will not leave Joseon,

246
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,940
then you will soon find out.

247
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,350
Tell me any time you need help.

248
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,280
I may not be your friend, but I will be your comrade, at least.

249
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,340
And that silly dream you had ...

250
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,710
In that dream,

251
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,010
was I happy?

252
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,950
You probably were.

253
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,190
He was the specialty chef for the previous king.

254
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,280
His name was Kim Ik Su, and he's probably about 60 years old now.

255
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,310
I will look into that.

256
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,020
But Du Chil is better when it comes to finding someone.

257
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,260
So I know his name and age. What about his hometown?

258
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,920
Since he is already known to be dead, it will be useless to go to his hometown.

259
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,270
He is most likely hiding in the capital.

260
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,050
His appearance?

261
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,350
- I don't know. 
 - Darn it. If he is in hiding,

262
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,850
- he probably changed his name and we don't even know what he looks like? How am I supposed to find him? 
 - Ah.

263
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,440
If you find retired court ladies, there is probably someone who knows his face.

264
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,890
I have to find him. Please help me.

265
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,380
Your family is always asking me to find someone for you every day.

266
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,800
Oh, my back...

267
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:48,990
Wow, the scent of flowers... Oh, you scared me!

268
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,700
Aigoo. I heard you found Court Lady Jo's family?

269
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,640
How did you find out? Did you meet with Hyeong Du Chil?

270
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,330
Good luck to you.

271
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,710
I already did well.

272
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,680
Court Lady Jo and I...  had intercâ€”

273
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,320
You're doing what? With whom?

274
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,460
Court Lady Jo! Court Lady Jo!

275
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,990
 The people's resentment against the tyranny of the current king ...

276
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,960
It's Dae Yeop.

277
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,580
Come in, Your Highness.

278
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,070
Please take a seat.

279
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,960
Seeing you take the upper seat

280
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,570
it appears that you've chosen to accept your fate, Your Highness, is that so?

281
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,060
Yes. I will do as you wish, Uncle.

282
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,870
You've made the right decision.

283
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,170
Were you writing a manifesto?

284
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,650
Yes, Your Highness.

285
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,830
It appears the time has come for restoration.

286
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,430
If so,

287
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,700
please also tell me your plans for restoration.

288
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,890
If you truly think of me as a king,

289
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,680
please tell me all the details of your plans for restoration.

290
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,330
Since it's a plan for my benefit, don't I have the right to know?

291
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,540
It is not necessary for you to know, Your Highness.

292
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,260
Please just trust in me.

293
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,330
As I thought,

294
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,380
all this time, you have raised me

295
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,120
as a tool, not as your son.

296
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,930
Once I grew up a bit, I was always curious.

297
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,220
Why Mother treated me differently from my older brothers

298
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,470
and what didn't she like about me? What did I do wrong?

299
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,080
I kept thinking about it and blamed myself.

300
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,510
You have misunderstood. It wasn't like thatâ€”

301
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,950
Please don't deny it.

302
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,130
Because you were the same, Father.

303
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,260
However, you were the opposite of Mother.

304
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,830
When my brothers did wrong, you punished them harshly.

305
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,010
But you always coddled me and covered up my mistakes.

306
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:33,110
I thought of that as your love for me, Father.

307
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,320
Even if my brothers were cold towards me

308
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,550
I thought they were envious of your love for me.

309
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:44,720
But I finally realized that they were all delusions.

310
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,990
Because I was not my father's and my mother's child.

311
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That was why things were that way. Isn't it true?

312
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,590
Your nephew is no different than your child,

313
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,970
so why did you treat me this way?

314
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,420
Because you regarded me as something to be used when the time came,

315
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,990
you never gave me any affection from the start, isn't that true?

316
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,670
Is what I say wrong?

317
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,530
Have you not yet found anything?

318
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,340
We have not, Your Majesty.

319
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,130
You are so quick at answering my questions.

320
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,090
You had told me Hwa In had died, had you not?

321
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,040
What were your intentions for deceiving me?

322
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,780
Your Majesty, please killâ€” please punish me!

323
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,310
It seems you do not want to die.

324
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,700
Even if I do not do anything, Yi I Cheom will not leave you alone.

325
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,770
Thus...

326
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,310
If you want to stay alive, bring me evidence!

327
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,230
I will carry out your order, Your Majesty.

328
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,050
Isn't this quite the bullshit, as you said?

329
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,100
I am the king, but I cannot even kill the man that attempted to kill my daughter.

330
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,210
Isn't that such bullshit?

331
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,960
I am overwhelmed.

332
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,070
Overwhelmed, what bullshit.

333
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,510
Your Majesty!

334
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,400
I am all right, I am all right.

335
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,500
- Bring more alcohol. 
 - Please compose yourself, Your Majesty.

336
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,840
- Bring me more alcohol! 
 - Your Majesty...

337
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,220
What are you doing? Call the royal physician.

338
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Your Majesty...

339
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,390
The situation is grave. You feel it too, do you not?

340
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,210
At this rate, the reinstatement of your family's name could be revoked.

341
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,200
But it's not just you. I'd also be in trouble as well.

342
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,750
Shouldn't we try to do something, in this situation?

343
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,150
The Western faction often gathers at His Excellency Prince Neungyang's home. Would you come join us?

344
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,020
I told His Excellency about you, and he expressed his wish to meet you.

345
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,590
You cannot put all your trust solely in his majesty the king, don't you think?

346
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,950
Consider it carefully.

347
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,050
Eonni. My mother is looking for you.

348
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,350
Tell me... You and Dae Seok...

349
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,090
Are you two getting along well?

350
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:06,220
You two have been apart for quite long when he had to go to the north.

351
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,460
This is something that can happen, of course... But it seems that even after he has come back,

352
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,540
you are still using separate rooms...

353
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:25,460
You are truly thinking of him as your husband, aren't you?

354
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,840
I am not sure what you are trying to say...

355
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,530
Dae Seok and you...

356
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:39,390
You two are not just pretending to be a couple, right?

357
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,550
Are you truly a couple? Is my question.

358
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,420
- Mother-in-law... 
 - It is because I am worried.

359
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,070
I am afraid that Dae Seok will be left as a single father again

360
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,290
if the king suddenly takes you away.

361
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,860
Such a thing will never happen, Mother.

362
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:05,230
Just as I am your daughter-in-law, I am your son's wife, not the princess.

363
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,230
That is right. You are not the kind of girl to lie.

364
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,900
I trust you.

365
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,830
Thank you, Mother.

366
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:20,030
Then, I will soon be able to see Cha Dol's younger sibling, will I not?

367
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,480
Do you have...

368
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,820
something to say?

369
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,680
No.

370
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,990
I had no idea how late it was.

371
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,520
I will go to my room and sleep.

372
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,000
Uh...

373
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,040
please just sleep here tonight.

374
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,670
I will lay down the blankets. Please do that.

375
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,360
No...

376
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,310
But...

377
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,670
By any chance, do you dislike me?

378
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,260
Is that why you always return to your room every night?

379
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,000
How can you say that? How could I dislike you?

380
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,560
It's just that Iâ€”

381
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,550
Then has my father the king commanded you to behave a certain way?

382
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,740
No. He did not.

383
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,830
Then why not? Even Mother is worried that there is something wrong between us.

384
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:11,020
If you do not dislike me, why do you avoid being with me?

385
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,370
I'm not avoiding you.

386
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
I am protecting you.

387
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,740
Please wait here just for a moment.

388
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,850
Please come to see me.

389
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,360
Please come out for a bit.

390
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,360
This is...?

391
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,890
The only thing I can give you is ...

392
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,320
my heart.

393
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,080
Even if that is all ...

394
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,190
can you still stay with me?

395
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,820
I want you to be my real wife.

396
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,160
Why are you crying so?

397
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,290
Do you... not want to?

398
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,800
It's not that.

399
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,510
That wasn't what I meant.

400
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,810
I will do it.

401
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,230
If I may be so bold...

402
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,970
I want to live with you forever.

403
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,420
A shabby wedding.  Without even a bride's crown.

404
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,810
I'm sorry that this is all that I can do for you.

405
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,520
Don't say that.

406
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,280
â™«  On a night darkness swallows the light  â™«

407
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,350
â™«  On a long silent night  â™«

408
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:30,970
â™«  Even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds  â™«

409
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,350
This will become the most beautiful bridal crown in the world.

410
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,770
â™«  Wandering here and there  â™«

411
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:48,040
â™«  Hovering again with no direction  â™«

412
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:57,030
â™«  I'm a lonely roamer who has lost his way  â™«

413
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:05,490
â™«  At the boundary of the place where wishes stop  â™«

414
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:11,730
â™«  I will wait for your arrival.  â™«

415
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:20,940
â™«  I will dream of a tomorrow where nothing happens  â™«

416
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,460
â™«  The word which you and I shared  â™«

417
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,450
â™«  Every word which lost its color  â™«

418
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:43,370
â™«  One by one surrounds me.  â™«

419
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:53,020
â™«  On a night darkness swallows the light  â™«

420
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:59,210
â™«  On a long silent night  â™«

421
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:06,960
â™«  On a night when even the moon falls asleep behind the clouds&nbsp;â™«

422
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:20,930
â™«  On a night when even the wind sleeps silently  â™«

423
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,130
Did you sleep well?

424
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,210
Did you sleep well, my son?

425
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,910
Yes.

426
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,180
Did you perhaps have a good dream? 
 (referring to the "pregnancy dream")

427
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,800
Huh?

428
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,270
Never mind.

429
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:59,790
My son, eat breakfast with me today.

430
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,400
Yes, sure.

431
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,490
Perhaps hyeong Du Chil is mistaken?

432
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,340
He said that man comes here every day at around this time, but there is no sign of him.

433
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,780
What?

434
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,980
Isn't that him?

435
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,490
Ah, you're right.

436
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,790
His height and appearance... Hyeong Du Chil said...

437
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,600
Hey, Ba Wu. Let's go together.

438
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,470
- Hey! 
 - It's him for sure!

439
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,140
Out of our way.

440
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,250
Move!

441
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
- Hurry. 
 - Over there.

442
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,370
Where did he go?

443
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,340
Did he go that way?

444
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,920
What brings you here?

445
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,420
Ba Wu.

446
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,880
It seems he doesn't have long to live, too.

447
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,110
Let's continue our conversation.

448
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,590
Please speak.

449
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,900
I've selected signs from the Book of Changes,

450
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,360
and it turns out, this coming full moon is an auspicious day.

451
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,870
How about setting the rebellion for that day?

452
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,570
Isn't that too soon?

453
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,550
We have to gather troops and get more people to join our sideâ€”

454
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,220
They say "eum gye oe seol ja pae"

455
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,570
Someone who leaks a secret plan is bound to fail.

456
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,110
For a plan like this, the less people who know about it, the better.

457
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:24,400
If we can just persuade the general of training, Yi Hong Rip, the capital forces cannot be mobilized.

458
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,940
We can succeed in the rebellion with our strength alone.

459
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,850
The general of training is an in-law of the chief state councillor, isn't he?

460
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,720
And the chief state councillor constantly interferes with our plans.

461
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,110
Will the general of training agree to what we want to do?

462
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,370
But if you consider that, aren't the chief state councillor and the left state councillor in-laws as well?

463
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,560
Please don't worry.

464
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,690
He can be persuaded easily, as he understands the times we are living in.

465
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,500
 (At the time of the Japanese Invasion in 1593, the general of the training division ...

466
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,180
 was designated as one of the five major generals of Joseon.)

467
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,820
For now, return home.

468
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,830
But what about you?

469
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,200
I'd better go to the palace.

470
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,710
But...

471
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,450
That's enough now.

472
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,850
Because the blade is sharp, I am afraid you might get hurt.

473
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,760
Your Majesty.  The Left State Councillor, the Minister of Justice, the Inspector General and the Chief Censor are here.

474
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,970
Ask them to enter.

475
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,620
Who is that man in the back?

476
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,230
He is someone you know as well, Your Majesty.

477
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,670
Ask him to come closer.

478
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,300
 Get rid of it right now!

479
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,560
He is the specialty chef who served the late king.

480
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,820
What is this scandalous thing you are doing right now?

481
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,390
Remove him from my presence at once!

482
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,220
You are dismissed.

483
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,540
So many people have seen you, would something happen to you by any chance?

484
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,970
So go now.

485
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:29,040
I have something to say to the left state councillor privately, so everyone please leave.

486
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:56,510
Anyone would think that he was your vassal, and not mine.

487
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:01,650
How can that be true? Please don't say such things.

488
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,790
You won't even bother to say, "I am overwhelmed," anymore, will you?

489
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,690
I am overwhelmed, Your Majesty.

490
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,170
So all I have to do is to retract the restoration of status of Kim Je Nam?

491
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,060
I will make sure Hwa In never leaves the Jeongeopwon* for the rest of her life. 
  (A temple for widowed royal consorts)

492
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,070
So please just forget about her.

493
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:35,450
Must you really kill her as well?

494
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,000
She is someone who is already dead.

495
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,280
Please let her go, Your Majesty.

496
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,440
Your Majesty.

497
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,530
Your Majesty?

498
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,860
Fine.

499
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,440
Do whatever you want. However,

500
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,400
bring me the head of that man who just left here.

501
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:18,440
If you bring me his head, I will retract the restoration of status

502
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,300
and turn over Hwa In to you.

503
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,120
Your grace is overwhelming, Your Majesty.

504
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,280
What is overwhelming, what do you mean?

505
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,430
Stop saying things you don't mean!

506
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,860
Everything will change in the very near future anyway.

507
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:17,720
So I am wondering if it's necessary to take the trouble to retract the restoration of status.

508
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,740
Won't this cause the king to become alert

509
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,110
and observe us with fire in his eyes?

510
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,860
The very purpose was to get rid of those eyes.

511
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:33,200
We need to trample the Westerners once, so that they won't get any ideas.

512
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,590
That is correct.

513
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,620
We have to show our power, in order to persuade the general of training.

514
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,860
It's killing three birds with one stone, isn't it?

515
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,070
You are impressive indeed, Your Excellency.

516
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,840
Father, it's your son Won Yeop.

517
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,910
Come in.

518
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,290
What happened?

519
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,950
I delivered his head to the head of the royal guard.

520
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,560
It was taken care of, Your Majesty.

521
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,450
Shouldn't we notify princess Hwa In?

522
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:24,370
And if Yi I Cheom ends up finding out?

523
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:33,400
Must I, the king of this nation, endure humiliation again?

524
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,180
I am overwhelmed, Your Majesty.

525
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,540
Tell the Chief Royal Secretary to cancel the restoration of titles of everyone associated with the events of 1613.

526
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,010
And decapitate the corpses that were already buried.

527
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,720
 (In 1613, at the behest of the Great Northen Faction, Gwanghaegun's younger brother, Grand Prince Yeongchang,

528
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,980
  and the prince's maternal grandfather Kim Je Nam,  were exiled and later executed.)

529
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,080
Search thoroughly!

530
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,960
Yes, sir!

531
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,430
I survived thanks to you.

532
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,610
Thank you, Sir.

533
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,900
It's not for your sake, but for her highness the princess.

534
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,450
No need to thank me.

535
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:54,670
In any case, you informed me against the will of His Majesty, so I should be grateful.

536
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,240
Don't resent his majesty too much.

537
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,040
He had no alternative but to consent to it.

538
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,140
So where will you go now?

539
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,170
No. If I know, I will be deceiving His Majesty.

540
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,970
So don't tell me.

541
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,550
I'd better be going now.

542
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,950
Wherever you go, be safe.

543
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,870
You take care of yourself, too, Sir.

544
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,620
Yes.

545
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,510
What happened to her highness the princess?

546
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,240
I haven't received any word yet.

547
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,440
But didn't you just inform Kim Dae Seok?

548
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,800
Did you plant someone among the royal guards as well?

549
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,270
Aren't you afraid of what his majesty would do if he knew?

550
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,630
I will keep quiet this time, but make sure to consult me in the future.

551
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,770
Do you understand?

552
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,000
I understand.

553
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,580
Where are they right now?

554
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,040
Are you hurt anywhere?

555
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,210
I'm fine.

556
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:49,740
Mother, please take Yeon Ok and Cha Dol and go to Sangwon Temple.

557
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,910
Then what about you and Daughter-in-law?

558
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,960
There are too many of us to go together

559
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,930
and Yi I Cheom is chasing me and her, so it is too dangerous.

560
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,400
No, let's go together.

561
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,850
We spent over ten years apart, and that is more than enough.

562
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,180
Even if we die, we should die together. And if we live, we should live together.

563
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes, let's go together, Brother.

564
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,200
We have to make sure Cha Dol survives, don't we?  He is our family's only descendant.

565
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,940
Father, I want to go with you.

566
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,540
I taught you to not interrupt when adults are talking, didn't I?

567
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,210
But Father ...

568
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:25,970
Let's do what Father says, since he is worrying about you.

569
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,200
Mother.

570
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,100
We will meet again soon, so don't worry.

571
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,600
Please take care of Cha Dol, Mother.

572
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,840
I understand.

573
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,540
The heavens are so indifferent.

574
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,310
How can this happen to us again?

575
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,280
Mother.

576
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,400
Please don't worry too much.

577
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,440
My husband will do whatever it takes to remove Yi I Cheom

578
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,660
and restore his family status.

579
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,420
Yes, please trust in me and wait.

580
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,170
All right, don't worry about us.

581
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,780
Take care of yourselves.

582
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,000
Yes.

583
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,360
Yes, Mother.

584
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:16,090
â™«  You can't leave and come back again  â™«

585
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,210
â™«  Eheradiya, it flows.  â™«

586
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:31,260
â™«  Gently flowing along the river it flows.  â™«

587
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:37,220
â™«  Eheradiya, it flows  â™«

588
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:43,920
â™«  It is us, living life  â™«

589
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,880
So did they leave safely?

590
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,840
Yes.

591
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,030
Should have I escorted them?

592
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:05,560
It's safer for us to not be with them.

593
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,930
But where will we go?

594
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,830
Do you have any place in mind?

595
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,630
If I knew such a place, I would have told you sooner.

596
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,050
The left state councillor already knows about most of the possible places.

597
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,970
So we need some place that he would never imagine.

598
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,700
How about the West Palace?

599
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,280
By West Palace, do you mean Gyeongwun Palace?

600
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,100
Yes, Her Highness the queen dowager is there, isn't she? 
  (Queen Dowager Inmok, mother of Prince Yeongchang, was confined there)

601
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:39,610
She is my husband's aunt, so wouldn't she help us hide there?

602
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,150
They are guarding that place like an iron fortress.

603
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:11,800
We could somehow climb the walls, but Court Lady Jo and the princess

604
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,760
couldn't do it. The wall is too high.

605
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,330
Where did my husband go?

606
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:21,670
He went to meet someone outside.

607
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,400
Who?

608
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,750
Where do you plan to go?

609
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,340
We thought we would go to the West Palace.

610
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,950
Let's go.

611
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,520
Come on up.

612
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,230
Please go.

613
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:20,040
I am more agile than you.  You go first.

614
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,000
- Whoever it is, go quickly! 
 - Hurry!

615
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,960

616
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,500
Come on up.

617
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,300
Will you go ahead?

618
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,180
I will take care of things here, so hurry and go.

619
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,200
Who are you?

620
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,300
- Hurry! 
 - Hurry.

621
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,390
Hurry and go up!

622
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,930
â™«  Words you don't mean  â™«

623
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,380
â™«  pile up like bits of dust  â™«

624
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:47,680
â™«  My heart has nowhere to rest for a while  â™«

625
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:54,340
â™«  Before you know it, it's another day   â™«

626
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,310
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
  â™«  Unable to say anything  â™«

627
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:04,600
 To me, she is not only my wife, but someone who has changed my fate.

628
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,630
 Do whatever you can to stop Yi I Cheom's rebellion.

629
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,660
 If I cannot stop his rebellion, I will commit suicide.

630
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,970
 But there is no way to stop the rebellion, is there?

631
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:17,640
 If the Lord sees this, Madam and Young Master will both die.

632
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,680
 There is one way to make Dae Yeop into a docile lamb, isn't there?

633
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,260
 I found the princess.

634
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:29,480
 An ominous event may happen in Joseon.

635
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,180
