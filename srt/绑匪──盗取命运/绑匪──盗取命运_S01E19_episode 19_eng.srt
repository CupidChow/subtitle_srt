00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,570
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,590
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,080
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,980

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,130
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,400
- Come on up. 
 - Will you go ahead?

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,220
I will take care of things here, so hurry and go.

8
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,080
Who are you?

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,020
- Hurry! 
 - Hurry.

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,350
Hurry and go up!

11
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,490
Are you all right? Are you hurt? Hurry.

12
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,580
Blood?

13
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,030
  Episode 19

14
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,210
Are you all right?

15
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,990
I am fine.

16
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,320
That way!

17
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,250
Please take good care of yourself!

18
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,090
Court Lady Jo.  I'm also all right.

19
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,270
It seems they have escaped the soldiers.

20
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,220
You there!  Who are you?

21
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,750
I thought I would never see you alive again.

22
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,940
What on earth are you doing?  How could you climb over the wall to see Her Highness?

23
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,290
I heard you were reinstated.  Was I mistaken?

24
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,420
It was withdrawn again due to Yi I Cheom's schemes.

25
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,780
Yi I Cheom. So it was him again...

26
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,880
But who is that woman?  Is she your wife?

27
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,300
No. She is someone who is like a sister to my wife.

28
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,190
Then your wife?  Don't say she's encountered a mishap?

29
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,970
She actually came with us. But the men saw her as she was trying to go over the wall.

30
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,000
Are you saying she was taken away by the soldiers?

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,550
Fortunately, I think she escaped, but I don't know where she is.

32
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,220
This is terrible.  My circumstances are such that I can not help.

33
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,860
I intend to go out again to find her.

34
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,730
But you said you didn't know where she was.

35
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,280
You're being too reckless.

36
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,260
Forgive me, but I am sure she is waiting for me to find her.

37
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,360
How can I do nothing under the circumstances?

38
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,910
But there is no guarantee that she is safe.

39
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,230
She is both strong and wise.

40
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,360
She will certainly persevere until I rescue her.

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,580
It seems there's no point in stopping you.

42
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,820
Tell him.

43
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,040
There is a secret passageway reserved for emergencies.

44
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,960
 It's safest right after the morning patrol, so you must wait until then.

45
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,090
Do you intend to repay this grace harming us?

46
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,080
Did you not promise me to wait until daybreak?

47
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,130
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,830
Thinking about the kinds of danger she could be in, I couldn't bear to just sit and wait.

49
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,750
This small opening is the lifeline for those of us living in Gyeongwun Palace.

50
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,530
When we were low on food, and when we urgently needed medicine due to a sudden illness, this opening was what kept us alive.

51
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,960
- I'll make sure to not get caughtâ€” 
 - I cannot allow that.

52
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,400
While I can understand your plight, I cannot leave Mother's life and mine to chance.

53
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,790
I beg you.

54
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:21,350
That woman isn't merely my wife. She was someone who changed my fate!

55
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,730
Careful, careful! Careful...

56
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,740
You can go ahead and take the princess to the Western Palace now.

57
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,490
Are you telling us to just leave you here like this and turn back? I cannot do that.

58
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,150
The guards will be regrouping right now.

59
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,300
If you waste any more time, it'll be impossible to return to the Western Palace.

60
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,800
You need treatment right now. But where should we go in the middle of the night like this?

61
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,530
Look, you should... you should sit here for a bit.

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,860
I will escort him from here.  You should go back to Gyeongwun Palace now.

63
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,260
Tell them that I am safe, so they shouldn't worry, but wait until I return.

64
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,090
It's me.

65
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,830
- What in heavens happened? How badly are you hurt? 
 - It's nothing serious.

66
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,750
- I must call the physician right away! 
 - I am fine.

67
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,860
I need an extra pair of hands, so please call Sam Wol here.

68
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,420
Brother-in-law!

69
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,820
Niece-in-law!

70
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,070
Have you been well, Aunt?

71
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,120
Why are you...?

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,520
If you stay here, our family may enter without warning, so use Court Lady Jo's room in the back.

73
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,460
You should go back now.

74
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,250
The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get into the Western Palace. So hurry!

75
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,110
I don't know when I'll see you again,

76
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,220
and I realize this is shameless and cruel of me to say this,

77
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,630
but I need to tell this to you with my own lips.

78
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,610
Please speak.

79
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,470
I have... formally had a wedding with that man.

80
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,700
I am now his wife.

81
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,890
I give you my congratulations.

82
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,890
No need to look at me that way.

83
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,460
I now have no more feelings toward you, Princess.

84
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,510
I am merely repaying you for all of the wicked things my father has done.

85
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,700
If you have nothing else to say, please go back now.

86
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,120
I will leave after saying my farewells to your aunt.

87
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,170
Please ... recover quickly.

88
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,820
Please be careful on your journey.

89
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,290
How did they know we were coming for them and made their escape?

90
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,420
Someone must have told them about us.

91
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,350
Wouldn't it be his majesty? After all, she is his daughter.

92
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,620
If he really cared about his daughter, he wouldn't have let things get this bad!

93
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,330
There has to be a rat that warned them in advance.

94
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,790
Why is any of that important?

95
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,690
If we lost them, we must first plan how to catch them again!

96
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,590
Forgive me.

97
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,120
No matter the cost, we have to find the princess and Kim Dae Seok.

98
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,160
If we lose them now, everything we planned for could be ruined!

99
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,230
Search any place they could be and leave no stone unturned.

100
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,800
We must find and kill them. Understand?

101
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,420
-Yes. 
 - Yes.

102
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,500
This won't do. The bleeding won't stop.

103
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,270
Go to the head servant and get a tuber of urn orchid or notoginseng* and bring it here. 
 (known to stop bleeding)

104
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, My Lady.

105
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,670
Why are you here?

106
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,630
Please pretend you don't know about this. I beg you.

107
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,230
You know better than any of us what would happen if Brother came to know about this.

108
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,840
So please... pretend you didn't see him.

109
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,200
You mustn't, Dae Yeop!

110
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,570
I cannot just let him go. If Uncle finds out about this, the princess will die.

111
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,280
Have you forgotten how many times he has helped you?

112
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,860
I bear no ill will against you. I also know well how much you've helped me.

113
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,110
But... I cannot let the princess die. I'm sorry.

114
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,000
That won't happen.

115
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,350
Even his majesty knows she's alive.

116
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,690
Knowing that, he won't easily harm her.

117
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,170
You are mistaken. Uncle plans to overthrow the king.

118
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,910
Do you think he's afraid of the king?

119
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,050
Let him go. He will never open his lips.

120
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,060
For decades this man pledged allegiance to Uncle.

121
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,270
He is the most faithful of faithful servants.

122
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,290
He carries a great scar on his back!

123
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,350
While trying to save you and me...

124
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,450
he took a blow from your uncle's blade.

125
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,330
A blade meant for me who was holding you.

126
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,050
This man took it instead.

127
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,720
You must get treatment immediately.

128
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,370
I will get notoginseng.

129
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,820
Have you been here all night?

130
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,330
Please don't worry too much. Didn't you say that she is both strong and wise,

131
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,820
so she'd persevere until you come for her?

132
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,330
It's true.

133
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,930
Dae Yeop is my son.

134
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,430
And his birth father...

135
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,870
is the late Prince Imhae.

136
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,890
You must've surmised it.

137
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,320
You don't look surprised at all.

138
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,470
That's not it.

139
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,100
It's just that ... I saw you treat him so affectionately all this time...

140
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,220
It all makes sense to me now.

141
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,580
The reason I'm revealing all of this to you is because I have a request.

142
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,200
Please speak.

143
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,140
Couldn't you...

144
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,200
take the initiative and let go of my dear Dae Yeop?

145
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,230
I also have something I'd like to tell you.

146
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,680
Speak.

147
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,880
I am already someone else's wife.

148
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,860
We even held a formal wedding.

149
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,260
Are you talking about Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson?

150
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,820
Yes.

151
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,950
Are you awake?

152
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,710
What about the princess?

153
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,170
She left for the western palace not too long ago.

154
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,880
Did you say it wasn't too long ago?

155
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,190
You mustn't move so soon. Your wound barely stopped bleeding just now.

156
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,420
If she were going to leave, she should've left last night.

157
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,210
Please just ... calm down.

158
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,980
If something wrong happens with your wound...

159
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,570
It's dangerous enough at night. She'll certainly be captured if she goes anywhere near that place now.

160
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,650
You should have stopped her from leaving at any cost!

161
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,930
I did, but...

162
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,850
her husband is waiting.

163
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,690
She's worried that he would come for her and meet with trouble.

164
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,140
She said she didn't fear death, so how am I supposed to stop her?

165
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,320
Should I have forcefully tied her up?

166
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,960
- Hyeong-nim. 
 - Shh!

167
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,890
How on earthâ€” how did you get here?

168
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,280
Why are you here? What about her?

169
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,230
Well... that... you see...

170
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,810
What's wrong with you?

171
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,730
It's nothing.

172
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,130
- What happened to herâ€” 
 - What happened to the princess?

173
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,480
Wasn't she at your place?

174
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,160
She said she was on her way to the western palace. Didn't you meet her?

175
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,850
What about your wound? Is it all right?

176
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,780
Hey, wait!

177
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,350
How can he run like that after being slashed with a sword?

178
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,020
Who are you?

179
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,460
Let go... Let go!

180
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,850
If you're captured too, what will happen to the princess?

181
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,250
He's right, Ba Wu. He can't help because he's injured.

182
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,100
You have to be safe if you want to rescue her later or whatever, right?

183
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,670
You go ahead back to Gyeonwun Palace. You remember that hole from earlier right?

184
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,870
What about you?

185
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,070
I have to rescue the princess.

186
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,450
But how?

187
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,990
I will meet the king.

188
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,830
But hasn't he already turned his back on you?

189
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,520
I'm strapped for time, I have no other choice.

190
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,550
If worse comes to worst, I'll cling to the hem of his robe and beg.

191
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,930
I will come with you.

192
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,440
Your body isn't in the best shape. You stay here. I'm going alone.

193
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,480
Hey, wait, Baâ€”!

194
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,120
Father!

195
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,540
We've found the princess!

196
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,900
Where is she now?

197
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,950
We received word from Seok Gye, the commandant of the palace guards.

198
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,490
They captured a woman dressed as a man, trying to climb the wall to the western palace, and took her to the royal investigations bureau.

199
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,370
Are you certain it's the princess?

200
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,590
Based on the description of her appearance, he is certain it's her.

201
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,250
Does the king know?

202
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,210
Seok Gye blocked the report and told me to let you know first.

203
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,620
Let's go. We must take her before the king finds out.

204
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,350
Sir Monk.

205
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,090
Has your mom gone somewhere?

206
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,580
She should be at the temple hall doing the 108 bows.

207
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,990
- Again? 
 - She said she had a bad dream that's eating away at her.

208
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,420
Grandmother!

209
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,130
I am fine. I am fine.

210
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,170
I'll do double the bows in your stead, so rest for a little while, please?

211
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,380
Oh, my dear child. My dear child.

212
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,030
Father should be safe and well.

213
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,980
So please don't worry too much.

214
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,020
You're right. You're right.

215
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,340
Please, Buddha, keep my father and mother safe.

216
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,640
Looks like you are from a provincial office.  What business do you have here?

217
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,450
I have an urgent message to give to the commandant of the royal guards.

218
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,110
And your token? Where's the token?

219
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,910
What's the matter?

220
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,580
I called him here, so step aside.

221
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,230
- But the tokenâ€” 
 - I told you to step aside!

222
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,270
You follow me.

223
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,320
Do you have a death wish? Where did you think this was?

224
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,750
I must see his majesty. Please let me see him in secret.

225
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,080
It's an urgent matter.

226
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,730
Please rescue the princess!

227
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,400
If she is taken by that man Yi I Cheom, she will surely die.

228
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,730
Please rescue her, Your Majesty!

229
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,170
Do you not know why I rescinded your title...

230
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,570
and turned my back on the princess?

231
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,290
I do know. Howeverâ€”!

232
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,030
If Yi I Cheom finds out about this, even I won't know what will happen next.

233
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,020
Give it up.

234
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,130
I cannot.

235
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,290
Do you think I'm happy about this situation?!

236
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,680
I made that decision with a torn heart.

237
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,130
I will do whatever it takes to block Yi I Cheom.

238
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,520
Please! Have pity on the princess, Your Majesty.

239
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,390
I think I was a step too late.

240
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,770
No way.

241
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,130
I'm told Jung Yeong took her.

242
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,880
Your Majesty, it is Jung Yeong.

243
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,850
Enter quickly!

244
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,190
Don't bother.  Just be seated.

245
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,590
Were you injured?

246
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,960
No. Thanks to Your Majesty, I am unharmed.

247
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,990
That's not true. I have no right to even look at you.

248
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,340
You must hold a lot of resentment against me.

249
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,680
Not at all. Thanks to you, I avoided harm.

250
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,500
How can I blame my father when this dull-witted girl got captured?

251
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,620
It's all thanks to me, you say?

252
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,050
Wasn't it because you sent us the commander of the royal guard to warn us in advance...

253
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,200
that we escaped capture?

254
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,520
But you rescued me again today.

255
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,450
Your grace truly knows no bounds.

256
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,350
I have one thing to tell you.

257
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,250
Please speak.

258
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,860
I have married the man next to me.

259
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,940
The situation did not allow me to ask for your permission...

260
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,940
so forgive me for only telling you this now.

261
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,370
I have disobeyed your order. Please punish me.

262
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,480
I wanted this. If anyone is to be punished, please punish me.

263
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,620
Disobedient child!

264
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,300
In the end, your stubbornness won out.

265
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,080
I am terribly sorry, Father.

266
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,550
The current situation is critical, so I'm overlooking this for now.

267
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,860
But I will surely punish you later.

268
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,420
Father.

269
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,920
By now, the left state councillor must be aware that the princess has disappeared.

270
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,480
A discussion of countermeasures is the priority.

271
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,600
How has this country Joseon reached this predicament?

272
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,880
I'm too ashamed to face my ancestors.

273
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,470
Father. What do you think if you instead convinced the Westerners

274
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,060
to stage a self-coup. ( An effort by the incumbent authority to enhance or retain power. )

275
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,410
Stage a self-coup?

276
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,880
Even in the former Goryeo dynasty, in order to oust the rebellious subject Yi Ja Gyeom,

277
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,010
I read that they staged a self-coup.

278
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,220
 (Yi Ja Gyeom was the father of Goryeo Dynasty Empress Dowager Mungyeong and grandfather of King Injong)

279
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,940
Have the Westerners gather their troops, and with that force, strike Yi I Cheom.

280
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,110
If I do, what if the Westerners harbor ulterior motives?

281
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,440
As the Westerners wish, release Queen Inmok who is confined in the West Palace.

282
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,890
And, if you distributed them the power held in the hands of the Great Northerners, wouldn't they follow you willingly?

283
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,390
Do you have a place ready for Hwa In to stay?

284
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,480
No one must learn that Hwa In is in the palace.

286
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Don't worry about that, Your Majesty.

287
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,720
You need to rest.

288
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
Yes, Father.

289
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,780
If you want to save Hwa In,

290
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,420
you must do whatever it takes to stop Yi I Cheom's revolt.

291
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,880
I will certainly do that.

292
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,230
If I can't stop Yi I Cheom's revolt,

293
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,180
I will end his life...

294
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,720
and take my own.

295
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,720
The princess was captured while trying to enter the West Palace,

296
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,090
then there's a high probability that Kim Dae Seok is hiding there too.

297
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,970
- Should we check immediately? 
 - It's already too late.

298
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,930
The princess has been captured, would he be still in the Western palace?

299
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm sorry.

300
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,500
Go in.

301
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,620
Will you be all right?

302
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,520
What are you talking about?

303
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,530
You disobeyed the king's order, and it's been revealed now.

304
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,220
I've already told him.

305
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,320
Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.

306
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,810
Go in. She is waiting.

307
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,930
Are you not hurt anywhere?

308
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,560
I am fine.

309
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,900
What about your hand?

310
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,900
It's all right.  Don't worry.

311
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,350
But why did you tell his majesty about our marriage?

312
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,030
The slightest slip could've incurred his wrath, wouldn't it?

313
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,420
I did it because I believed Father wouldn't be able to easily drive you away then.

314
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,720
Whether he loves it or not, you're now the king's son-in-law. So surely, he'll protect you, right?

315
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,510
It's a misunderstanding!

316
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,870
Y-you! In this situation ... How could you?!

317
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,630
Is that where your mind is at?!

318
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,730
This dirty hand! Dirty hand! Dirty!

319
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,840
You dare?!

320
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,930
My dirty hand...

321
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,720
What do you think about using the Westerners to stage a self-coup?

322
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,760
I don't think it's a bad idea.

323
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,430
Meet with Kim Ja Jeom and sound out his intentions.

324
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,520
I heard that the Westerners are meeting more frequently these days.

326
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,540
More precisely, at prince Neungyang's house.

327
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,260
The left state councillor and the Great Northerners are in a frenzy.

328
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,770
We are painfully planning for the worst.

329
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,680
Is that so?

330
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,290
Yes. We mustn't waste a moment ousting the Councillor,

331
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,420
if we are to relieve his majesty of his worries, right?

332
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,410
Surely you don't have ulterior motives, would you?

333
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,350
How could I?

334
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,970
I am already indebted to you, so how could I have other thoughts?

335
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,780
Please believe me.

336
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,000
Could I squeeze one more person into that meeting?

337
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,740
Go on in.

338
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,460
Why do you look surprised?

339
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,650
Didn't I tell you there was a meeting today?

340
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,330
Let's go.

341
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,670
The house owner makes the guests wait and is only coming now?

342
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,720
I apologize.

343
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,150
Say your greetings. This is His Excellency Prince Neungyang.

344
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,210
 Is this also for treason?

345
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,630
This is the Queen Dowager's nephew I told you about.

346
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,860
Glad to meet you. I'm Kim Dae Seok.

347
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,370
Glad to meet you. Take a seat.

348
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,860
Unfortunately, I have something urgent to attend to, so I must leave.

349
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,930
I will pay for today's rudeness some other time.

350
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,510
What a rude person!

351
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,070
Who does he think he is?

352
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,700
Wait!

353
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,770
Wait!

354
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,240
How can you just leave like that?

355
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,960
I didn't know that his excellency prince Neungyang would be there.

356
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,830
This isn't a place I should be at.

357
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,290
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
 - Look, there!

358
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,800
If you leave like this I'll be very disappointed.

359
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,250
Please help me.

360
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,390
not only I Cheom, but the present king...

361
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,520
is also the your and the queen dowager's enemy, right?

362
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,540
You and I are in the same boat.

363
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,900
If you really can't cooperate with us,

364
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,920
then at least tell her highness the queen dowager

365
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,850
my intentions, please.

366
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,070
- What happened?
 - Will you get drunk at this rate?

367
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,800
You should just drink straight from the bottle.

368
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,310
I asked you what happened.

369
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,780
Can't you tell just by looking at how I came back in one piece?

370
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,060
Tell me everything in detail.

371
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,040
Don't be too upset.

372
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,680
Your royal father tried his best until the end

373
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,250
to avoid the rescindment of the reinstatement.

374
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,570
Yes.

375
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,660
I am also well aware.

376
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,620
Before his majesty became your father,

377
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,530
wasn't he first the father of the nation?

378
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,350
The reason why he had to do all those wicked things to you is only ...

379
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,620
Mother.

380
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,090
I do not resent Father.

381
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,200
Do you really think that way?

382
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,550
I am being sincere.

383
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,900
If it weren't for Father,

384
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,330
I wouldn't be able to sit in front of you like this.

385
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,800
My daughter has such a beautiful face,

386
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,700
but her heart is more beautiful.

387
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,290
Your hands are rough. Is married life giving you a hard time?

388
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,090
Oh, no. Because of Lady Jo,

389
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,510
I don't even get a droplet of water on my hands.

390
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,140
I thought you would have to live as a widow your whole life,

391
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,140
so I said it because I'm happy.

392
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,410
Does he treat you well?

393
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,970
Yes, Mother.

394
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,090
You smile just thinking of him.

395
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,490
I'm sorry.

396
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,140
Don't be.

397
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,320
He seemed trustworthy since the day I first met him.

398
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,360
Which is why I asked him to protect you.

399
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:06,540
However, it always bothered me that we were never able to give you a proper wedding.

400
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,730
The wedding hall... without even a bridal crown...

401
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,830
Instead of a bridal crown, he picked flowers and made a wreath

402
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,220
and placed it on my head.

403
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,900
It was the only one of its kind...

404
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,850
And more beautiful than any bridal crown.

405
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,670
I can see how much he adores you.

406
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,870
I would really like to express my gratitude.

407
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,010
I wonder when I'll be able to see him again.

408
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,680
You will see him one day.

409
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,450
That man wants to meet you

410
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,750
and offer you his greetings as his mother-in-law.

411
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,980
So there will be a day.

412
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,760
Yes. Since you can't tell lies,

413
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,210
I will put my trust in you.

414
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,060
If the Westerners are harboring other intentions,

415
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,910
we have no way to block the treason, isn't it?

416
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,730
What are you doing?

417
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,630
Help me.

418
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,810
I can't seem to find a way to stop your father by myself.

419
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,450
We must save the princess first.

420
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,640
Help me just this once.

421
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,930
Am I right?

422
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,610
Yes, that is so.

423
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,730
It's a seat I wish to avoid if I can.

424
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,770
Then that's enough.

425
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,910
If you reject it to the very end,

426
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,110
until they find someone else besides you to take the throne,

427
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,870
your uncle won't be able to do anything.

428
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,940
Then, wouldn't the plans of treason be naturally aborted?

429
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,140
If I choose no longer to follow the goals set by my uncle,

430
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,640
they will use you as a hostage to threaten me.

431
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,850
Don't worry about me.

432
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,970
If the worst comes to worst,

433
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,380
I have a plan.

434
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,030
This was the handkerchief I made for your late father.

435
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,100
 Imhae

436
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,920
This is something that will tell you who killed your father.

437
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,910
Corroborative evidence.

438
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,090
 Yi I Cheo...

439
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,490
Due to the poison, he vomited blood.

440
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,360
With that blood he tried to write the name of the person who killed him,

441
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,590
but he wasn't able to finish the last letter and passed away.

442
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,990
It was poison?

443
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,070
Maybe it wasn't enough for them that he took poison.

444
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,580
They even sent an assassin.

445
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,720
Who did you hear this from?

446
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,870
The person who gave me this handkerchief

447
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,230
and relayed the message,

448
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,500
was that man, Tae Chul.

449
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,330
If it weren't for him, I would've never known

450
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,660
about your father's horrendous and wrongful death.

451
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,990
Your father's death

452
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,650
is something I'll never forget until the day I die.

453
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,670
Even for my building,

454
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,230
I took "hae", the word for "sea", from your father's princely name, Imhae,

455
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,640
and thus named it "Haeindang."

456
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,420
My uncle...

457
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,270
Exactly why did he kill my father?

458
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,310
He was comparing your father

459
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,760
and the current king as candidates for succeeding to the throne.

460
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,380
As the opinion of the government officials leant toward the current king,

461
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,590
he made sure that I wasn't able to meet your father.

462
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,980
After that, afraid that your father would open his mouth about me,

463
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,670
they accused him of treason.

464
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,360
However, even after that,

465
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,060
the current king didn't want to kill his own brother.

466
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,510
So, your uncle sent an assassin to go and kill him.

467
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,460
How could you tell me this only now?

468
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,340
I didn't want to put you through this hell as well.

469
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,630
If it meant I could protect you, I was willing

470
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,230
to take this hellish secret with me to the grave.

471
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,650
Don't follow me

472
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,910
and wait here.

473
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,970
I will go with you.

474
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,920
No. You should never use this.

475
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,690
Move aside. I've kept this proof in preparation for days like these.

476
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,850
Now it's time for me to use it.

477
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,160
If His Excellency sees this,

478
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,400
you and the young master will both die.

479
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,410
He'll kill you and get rid of the evidence too.

480
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,990
The reason he spared both of your lives is because...

481
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,020
you kept your mouth closed.

482
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,420
If you want to protect your mother,

483
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,000
get rid of this first.

484
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,000
You can't!

485
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,910
I'm sorry, Mother.

486
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,030
- No, Dae Yeop! Dae Yeop!
 - My Lady.

487
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,600
This is all for your sake.

488
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:46,430
â™«  I will cut a day out  â™«

489
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:54,530
â™«  among the difficult days of my life  â™«

490
00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:02,050
â™«  and fill it with someone's gentle breath  â™«

491
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:09,770
â™«  when I try to cope  â™«

492
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,060
What are you doing?

493
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,780
Mother.

494
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,740
More than my late father,

495
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,950
you are the most important to me.

496
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:32,550
â™«  Because I've heard   â™«

497
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:40,070
â™«  the voice calling out to me  â™«

498
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,260
What brings you out here?

499
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,600
When such an important event is about to happen,

500
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,340
the king is staying too low and quiet. It feels uneasy.

501
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,430
Go there in person and check thoroughly whether they are doing their best to get prepared.

502
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,400
Yes, Father.

503
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,230
You are ready, right?

504
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,770
What is this noise?

505
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,920
It sounds like a gunshot.

506
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,010
It couldn't have been our household, could it?

507
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,440
Probably not, sir.

508
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,010
They might have met government soldiers. I will take some of my subordinates to check.

509
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,740
No. I'm coming with you.

510
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,480
Where did the noise come from?

511
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,050
I believe it was from there.

512
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,270
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

513
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,900
Come on!

514
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,000
Lee Dae Yeop!

515
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,860
Here...

516
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,990
If they are armed with these weapons, we can't stop them. We need to blow up everything.

517
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,850
If this much gunpowder blows up at once, flames will sweep over everywhere.

518
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,490
What do you want to do then? We can't just leave them here.

519
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,330
No, we can't.

520
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,620
Soldiers are coming.

521
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,000
I will go stop them, so...

522
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,820
I will leave it in your hands.

523
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,440
If you go alone, you could be in danger.

524
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,820
Your situation could be worse.

525
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,880
Don't worry.

526
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,530
I have trust in you.

527
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,190
Lee Dae Yeop.

528
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,060
Release him.

529
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,480
Pardon?

530
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,680
Your Highness.

531
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,080
Why did you do something so reckless?

532
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,540
Kill me.

533
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,880
It's upsetting that I should die before I avenge my father,

534
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,310
but I don't have any intentions to work with my enemy... So, go ahead and kill me.

535
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,830
Has this bastard lost his mind? How dare he?

536
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,440
I'm not sure what you heard or where you heard it from, butâ€”

537
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Uncle...

538
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,000
I know everything you did to my father.

539
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,630
I have heard the rumor as well.

540
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,960
But you already know.

541
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,200
I have so many enemies out there. Everyone is slandering me.

542
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,900
Stop there.

543
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,730
I can no longer believe a single word coming out of your mouth.

544
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,670
You don't look well.

545
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:12,750
Let's finish this conversation later. I think you should go take some rest.

546
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,360
I will never go along with your plan.

547
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,130
You still want to let me go?

548
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:21,990
Father.

549
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,880
If I cannot stop a mere rumor going around,

550
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,010
how could I dare to support you, Your Highness?

551
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:34,490
I will come back to you with proof that I'm innocent.

552
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,840
It feels uneasy.

553
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,780
He's acting up as if he's gone insane.

554
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,520
Even if we sit him on the throne, would he support you in the future?

555
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,660
Should I take Aunt and threaten him?

556
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,290
Don't even think about it.

557
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:58,320
Your aunt will immediately kill herself if Dae Yeop has a hard time because of her.

558
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,280
Then, what should we do?

559
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:07,650
We have one solution to make Dae Yeop a meek little lamb.

560
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,550
I heard that Princess Hwa In is in the palace.

561
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:19,020
Do you intend to break the promise between us?

562
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,580
If you don't keep your promise,

563
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,060
there is no other option for me but to break my promise as well.

564
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:37,400
Please tell me where the princess is.

565
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,780
If I say I can't, then what?

566
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:49,330
A treason might happen in this country, Joseon.

567
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,050
Give me some time to think this through.

568
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,270
Why won't you respond? Didn't I just say to give me some time?

569
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,840
I will come back in two hours.

570
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,270
I will summon you when I make up my mind. Go back to your place and wait for my call!

571
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:15,360
I will come back in two hours.

572
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,730
Is anyone out there?

573
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,160
Gae Si!

574
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,610
Gae Si!

575
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,320
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

576
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,870
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

577
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,400
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

578
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,660
Summon the royal physician!

579
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,000
Your Majesty.

580
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,850
What's on your mind?

581
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,120
I'm sorry.

582
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,740
What did you say?

583
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,470
Mother-in-law will be fine.

584
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,500
Cha Dol must be doing well, too.

585
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:21,140
Your Highness, it's me, Lady Kim.

586
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,160
Please come in.

587
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,160
You need to relocate yourself, Your Highness.

588
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,140
Did we get caught?

589
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,600
No.

590
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,320
It's suspicious that Yi I Cheom wants to see His Majesty,

591
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,070
so I want to make sure things don't go wrong. Don't worry.

592
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,280
Let's go.

593
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:52,220
It's a place for women, so Her Highness can only go by herself.

594
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,450
How far are we going?

595
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,090
We're almost there.

596
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,930
That way.

597
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,960
Let's go.

598
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,120
Have you been well, Your Highness?

599
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,380
Is this Royal Father's will?

600
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,870
His Majesty doesn't know about this.

601
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,950
No way... Are you working with the Left State Councillor?

602
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:08,150
As I have told you before, I make decisions for the sake of His Majesty.

603
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,020
Since I am handing you over the princess,

604
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:19,390
I will assume that you will keep your promise of not doing anything else.

605
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,190
Don't worry.

606
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,670
For the sake of this country, Joseon, and His Majesty,

607
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,620
I think that you know how you should behave.

608
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,380
I will take my leave, then.

609
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:51,710
Quickly get on the palanquin, Your Highness.

610
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:00,930
If Royal Father finds out, he will never forgive you.

611
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:07,580
Do you truly believe that His Majesty didn't see this coming?

612
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:12,130
Do you mean Lady Kim lied?

613
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:17,820
Do you know why His Majesty adores Lady Kim?

614
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,470
It's because she reads the mind of His Majesty in advance,

615
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:25,000
and  makes her move in his stead without him having to tell her anything.

616
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,630
Escort her.

617
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,590
If you try to escape,

618
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:42,180
I don't know what will happen to the king and her highness the royal consort.

619
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,040
Are you all right with that?

620
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,380
Do you want to die?

621
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,370
How dare you hand over Hwa In at your whim?

622
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,940
The decision was made exclusively for you.

623
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,030
It was to buy time for the Westerners to mobilize while misleading Yi I Cheom.

624
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,920
Shut your mouth!

625
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,550
If you think I was mistaken, kill me.

626
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,880
Yes. Since you want me to kill you,

627
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,680
I will kill you today.

628
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,410
It was his majesty's decision?

629
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:40,590
It was not. It was  Court Lady Kim did this on her own.

630
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,630
Where are you going?

631
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,620
I need to see the king.

632
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,600
We need to rescue the princess.

633
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,110
It's no use.

634
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,200
What do you think he will do?

635
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,480
I mean Yi I Cheom.

636
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,250
Because he took Princess Hwa In,

637
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,980
I don't think he will launch the rebellion immediately.

638
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:11,430
What would you like to do with Kim Dae Seok?

639
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:15,560
Your Majesty.  It is Her Highness, the Royal Consort.

640
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,250
How could you? How could you do this?

641
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,420
How can you be a father and sell her?

642
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,550
Even a beggar in the street would not do that.

643
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,910
- Compose yourself, Your Highness. 
 - Stay out of this.

644
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,880
Your Highness. What happened to the princess was not the king's act. I did it.

645
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,380
Everything was done for the sake of His Majesty and this country.

646
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:44,330
Shut your mouth. How dare you speak of His Majesty and the country?

647
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,350
If Your Majesty truly had no intention of sending Hwa In away,

648
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:52,080
how can this wench, who deserves to die, stand here in one piece and open her mouth?

649
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,090
Your Majesty didn't have the will to stop this wench. Isn't this why you let her?

650
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,220
Do you love the throne that much?

651
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,340
Is that position the only thing you value so that you only see that place?

652
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:09,310
Will you retain that position even if you have to sell your daughter?

653
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,260
You are in the presence of the King, Your Highness.  Your speechâ€”

654
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,400
Do you really want to die? I just told you to shut up!

655
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,810
Was it, as this wench said, for the sake of protecting the royal family and the country?

656
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,070
If not, this time again, was it for Hwa In's sake?

657
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,990
Will you say it was the only choice you could have made for that child's safety?

658
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,990
Please say something.

659
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,280
How can a father corner his own daughter into a deadly situation?

660
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,670
Even if it is an excuse, say it.

661
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,170
Hwa In has been killed by Your Majesty.

662
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,630
Your Majesty is no longer a husband nor a father.

663
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,040
Even after I die and go to the afterworld,

664
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,900
I will never look again at your cold cruel face.

665
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,890
Don't ever look for me again.

666
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,960
That power you like so much,

667
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,190
please relish it for a thousand years.

668
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,810
Of course, it's power you earned by abandoning your own child,

669
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:23,200
so you must enjoy it for a long time.

670
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,240
However, there will be no one with you now.

671
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:35,210
Even heaven would never allow you to have someone who wholeheartedly thinks of you.

672
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,620
Your Majesty.

673
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,050
Isn't there anyone outside?

674
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,000
He seems to have a bad headache so get some medâ€”

675
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,750
I don't need any. Everybody leave me alone.

676
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,890
You Majesty, please go to your sleeping quarters...

677
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,800
I said for everyone to leave.

678
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,650
Are you all right?

679
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:29,240
My poor daughter... Her only sin is to be born as the king's daughter.

680
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,450
How can these cruel things happen to her?

681
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,270
The princess will be safe.

682
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,850
I

683
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,540
will make certain of that.

684
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:46,880
I will rescue her, no matter what.

685
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,670
Please trust me and be patient.

686
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,260
 Do you love the throne that much?

687
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,350
 Is that position the only thing you value, so that's the only thing you can see?

688
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,300
 Will you retain that position even if you have to sell your daughter?

689
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:20,030
 Hwa In ... has been killed by Your Majesty.

690
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,690
 Your Majesty is no longer a husband nor a father.

691
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,550
What's going on here?

692
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,890
It is a gesture of allegiance from me toward Your Highness.

693
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,210
Isn't this the princess you've always wanted?

694
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,150
Now you are free to embrace her as you like.

695
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:13,440
Shut your dirty mouth!

696
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:31,010

697
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:37,510
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

698
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:42,670
 Becoming the king of Joseon is your destiny

699
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,740
 and you cannot avoid it, so do not reject it, Your Highness.

700
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:48,630
 It this situation, the only way to dislodge Yi I Cheom is a rebellion.

701
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,320
 We need to plan the rebellion for before the middle of the month.

702
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,060
 It is certain that Kim Dae Seok will appear and attempt to save the princess.

703
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,190
 Be prepared to catch him.

704
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:00,310
 You should unleash your soldiers to capture every single Westerner.

705
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,530
 Search here!

706
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,990
 I will be with you to the end.

707
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,520
 I believe my husband will surely succeed.

708
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,050
 Therefore, I won't be able to stay with him.

709
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,330
 Your Majesty, it's treason!

710
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:18,690
 â™« You'll never regret it  â™«
