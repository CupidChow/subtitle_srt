00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,520
 Jung Il Woo

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,480
 Kwon Yu Ri

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,170
 Shin Hyun Soo

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,980

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,050
 Bossam

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,750
I mean... what if something happens to you while you're off by yourself? What will you do then?

7
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,370
I will take care of it by myself, so don't worry.

8
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,140
You always say "Don't worry, I'll take care of it".

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,710
What exactly shouldn't I worry about, and how will you take care of it?

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,500
You keep doing worrisome things in front of me.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,940
And should someone like that look so happy when I came to rescue you?

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,340
Th-that was because we met on the boat. I had secretly hoped—

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,190
Then you should've trusted me to the end!

14
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,120
Didn't you say this? That we should never meet again?

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,580
Why don't you forget things like that? I told you I had my reasons!

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,500
You only remember such useless things like that.

17
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,940
Does someone remember because she wants to?

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,680
The words you say, the things you do...

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,300
each one of them just came to my mind.

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,550
What do you want me to do with that?

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,920
Give me... a little space.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm sorry.  I was disrespectful.

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,690
Yes. You're impertinent.

24
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,010
True.  I was very impertinent.

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,150
 Episode 9

26
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,100
Are you all right?

27
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,950
I'm sorry.  I did it without thinking.

28
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,360
Never mind.  That's enough.

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,980
Are you going to forgive me?

30
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,880
Didn't you also say you did it in ignorance?

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,160
You said it wasn't your intent.

32
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,540
What difference does it make whether I forgive or not?

33
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,250
It's fine if we say it just didn't happen.

34
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,390
Then, that's fine.

35
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,520
Then, neatly ...

36
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,930
we can say it never happened.

37
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,830
I understand.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,760
so let's just go in.

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,750
- You leave first. Court Lady Jo and I— 
 - I don't think I can do that.

40
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,610
What do you mean?

41
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,300
I'm going with you no matter what you say. Don't say anything more.

42
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,130
But ...

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,760
Didn't I just tell you to not to say anything more?

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,220
- Impertinent! 
 - Even if you say I'm impertinent ten million times, I will never change my mind.

45
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,340
What did you just say?  To whom do you dare?

46
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,290
Didn't you say that yourself

47
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,180
"Now I will no longer be a princess.  I'm going to live as a commoner"

48
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,530
I believe you meant those words.

49
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,830
So you aren't a princess any longer. You are just a woman.

50
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,380
The one whom I want to protect with my life.

51
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,490
- I appreciate what you are saying— 
 - Trust me.

52
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,090
Follow me on my terms

53
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,330
so I can protect you at my side.

54
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,860
I'm going in first.

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,390
It's cold, so don't stay outside too long.

56
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:04,780
 ♫ Butterflies in my stomach spreads to greenwood ♫

57
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
What about Her Highness?

58
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:33,400
 ♫ I will be the flower next to you ♫

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
Your Highness?

60
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,560
Yes.

61
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,680
What are you doing?

62
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,980
I think the gates are closing soon.

63
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,120
What do you think about sleeping for a while and leaving as dawn approaches?

64
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,290
All right.

65
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,760
What did I say before?  I said we shouldn't leave at night.

66
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,720
What are you all doing?  Let's sleep.

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,530
Wow.  A perfect pillow.

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,730
I'll return it when we leave later.

69
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,350
But your pillow is here, Father.

70
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,370
Let's sleep, Cha Dol.

71
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,720
Let's go to bed.  Let's go.

72
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,020
Thank you.

73
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,850
I thank you too.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
 Although we were never married,

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,350
 since you are so attached to our past memories, with this symbol of divorce, I now cut off our bonds.

76
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,360
 For your sake, I will do anything.

77
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,690
 So please... don't make me say with my mouth

78
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,000
 that the princess is alive to your father. Please.

79
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,190
It's the sea! The sea!

80
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,600
Let's hurry!

81
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,520
You'll trip Your Highness! Please be careful!

82
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,740
This is nice!

83
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,460
- Father! Hurry over here! 
 - What about me?

84
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,860
You too, Mr. Chun Bae!

85
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,230
Let's go! It's the sea!

86
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,730
 ♫  Sweetly and gently infused with ♫

87
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,920
One! Two! Three!

88
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,020
Wow! Three times! It skipped three times!

89
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,910
You're great at this, Cha Dol!

90
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,990
It's now my turn. Watch me!
♫  Don't release the clasped hands . ♫

91
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,560
Thank you.

92
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,120
What for?

93
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I got to see the sea thanks to you.

94
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,050
Is this your first time?

95
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,520
Then again, you spent your life in the palace. It makes sense this is your first.

96
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,960
Thanks to you, I'm enjoying a lot of first-time experiences.

97
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm sorry. I made you experience things you didn't need to.

98
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,390
No. I meant to say thank you for allowing me to experience things I otherwise couldn't have.

99
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,520
Thank you for your words at least.

100
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,700
They're not empty words.

101
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,220
If I never met you, I probably would've never seen the sea.

102
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,380
Why are you staring at me like that? Don't tell me you're...

103
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,170
N-no, it's not that!

104
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,020
It's fine if it isn't. Why are you getting angry about it?

105
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,960
That's... because you keep making me into a weird person.

106
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,430
Well back then you also looked at me weirdly and did an insolent thing—

107
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,090
Let's go. Yes.

108
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,980
Here!

109
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,800
This here is Jemulpo! 
  (old name of Incheon harbor)

110
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,070
There are so many fascinating things, right?

111
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,190
All of the world's cultures gathers here.

112
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,260
Your Highness, th-that over there!

113
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,160
Those gems!

114
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,680
Now, let's go this way. This way!

115
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,910
Welcome! What kind of book are you looking for?

116
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,890
I bet it's not Confucian or the Sutras. Is it... erotica? I'm right, aren't I?

117
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,160
I have a killer edition, are you interested?

118
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,540
Hyeong-nim Ma Su! It's me Chun Bae!

119
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,090
- Ch-Chun Bae?! 
 - Yes!

120
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,730
Are... are you really Ch-Chun Bae?

121
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,110
- Yes, Hyeong-nim! 
 - Hey, Chun Bae!

122
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,520
Oh my! Oh my!

123
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,150
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course!

124
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
- Leave! 
 - No, Hyeong-nim!

125
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,100
- Hyeong-nim, just once, wouldn't you—? 
 - I said leave, you rascal!

126
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,750
You suddenly appear after some ten-odd years and ... what?

127
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,970
You want me to find you a house? You crazy fool. Get out of my sight!

128
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,350
Oh, oh Hyeong-nim! Please, just help us this once.

129
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,020
Where would we go in this harsh winter? My family will freeze to death, Hyeong-nim!

130
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,120
Please help me this once. Help me this once!

131
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,710
My... my word!

132
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,820
It's just three months. If you don't pay rent within three months, I'm kicking you out, understand?

133
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,650
Oh, don't worry, Hyeong-nim!

134
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,350
But... which one of these is your partner?

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
Th-this one.

136
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,830
Then this child. Is he your kid?

137
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,390
No, it's his wife's kid.

138
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,830
I was going to shoo them away,

139
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm taking pity on you for my sister-in-law's* sake, you rascal!
   (he means Court Lady Jo)

140
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,520
Thank you, Hyeong-nim! I will pay you back this debt until the day I die!

141
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,170
Forget it, boy! I don't know why I care about you so much.

142
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,020
Go home safely!

143
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,860
The greedy bastard collects rent money, then acts like he's all benevolent.

144
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,060
You-you! Are you crazy? What were you thinking?!

145
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,050
Why are you mad? Then what was I supposed to say?

146
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,220
Should I announce to the whole village that her highness the princess has arrived?

147
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,560
It's better that she pretends to be Ba Wu's wife. If I kept saying "Highness, Highness..."

148
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,100
- Stop saying  "highness", you buffoon! 
 - Ow!

149
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,210
Excuse me. Do you have any jobs left?

150
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,730
Wait one second. Sorry, I have none.

151
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,290
There sure is a lot of stuff here.

152
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,320
Hey Scumbag!

153
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,770
Aren't you Mr. Scumbag from Cheonggyecheon, Ba Wu?

154
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,800
Hyeong-nim Geo Jeong?!

155
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,020
That's right, that's right.

156
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,840
- What are you doing here? 
 - Well...

157
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,970
I'm running a small business.

158
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,580
But more importantly, what are you doing in Jemulpo?

159
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,220
Chun Bae is doing well too, right?

160
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,360
We left Hanyang together.

161
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
Wh-why?

162
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,900
Did you get into trouble?

163
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,590
Hyeong-nim, please find work for me to make money.

164
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,850
You need to make money? But... this work is quite brutal.

165
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,720
Will it be all right?

166
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,290
As long as it's not illegal...

167
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,010
Do you think you can make money legally?

168
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,820
If you have work I can do, let me know.

169
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,440
Sure.

170
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,660
Let's have a drink with Chun Bae sometime! I'll see you later!

171
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,100
Have you completed the preparations?

172
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,860
Yes. With this evidence, even his majesty will have to back down.

173
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,710
Let's go.

174
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,050
This is the ledger that contains evidence of the minister of defense committing fraud.

175
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,750
And here are the confessions from the tribute merchants and government officials.

176
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,530
Please take a look.

177
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,360
I have arrested the tribute merchants and taken the brokers who colluded with the minister of defense to the left police station.

178
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,790
We need only your word to transfer them to the royal investigation bureau.

179
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,920
Nonsense! Nothing has been clarified from his investigation. How could you seek his dismissal so soon?

180
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,860
I have ordered for it to be investigated again.

181
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,900
Your Majesty. I, your Minister of Justice, Han Chan Nam, wish to inform you.

182
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,750
Due to the construction of the palace, the country's finances have been sucked dry.

183
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,720
The people's grievances are piercing the skies.

184
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,130
Please dissolve the Royal Architect's office, and appease the people, Your Majesty!

185
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,000
- Please appease them, Your Majesty! 
 - Please appease them, Your Majesty!

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,610
How can the people's grievances be because of the Royal Architect?!

187
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,670
The people are war-torn because of foreign invaders, and starving because of a drought.
   (the Japanese invasions of 1592–1598)

188
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,220
Why isn't anyone speaking up about providing them work or giving them food?

189
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,090
Fine. If you all truly care for the people,

190
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,790
open your storehouses

191
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,660
and share your rice with the starving people.

192
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,920
I will listen to your pleas afterward.

193
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,220
I will never dissolve the office of the royal architect.

194
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,500
Don't forget the reconstruction of the palace and its related buildings is my personal project.

195
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,900
 The palace was a casualty of the Imjin War (1592-1598).  .

196
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,420
Don't take his side because he's your successor*.
 (Jeong In Hong had served as Chief State Councillor)

197
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,070
The Left State Councillor puts his priorities ahead of mine.

198
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,050
Your Majesty, if you insist,

199
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,840
don't force him out, but let him resign willingly as I have done.

200
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,630
If you force him out,

201
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,730
who will be your sword and shield in the future?

202
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,740
Please hear my plea!

203
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,640
These are the criminal confessions investigated by the right police division.  Read them.

204
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,600
What are you trying to scheme?

205
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,580
You sold government position certificates without his majesty knowing.

206
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,040
And it seems you accepted quite a few bribes from tribute collectors?

207
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,150
Are you trying to threaten me?

208
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,710
Have a seat.

209
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,900
I said, have a seat.

210
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,760
What is it you want?

211
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,800
When you brought these confessions to me instead of his majesty,

212
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,540
you must have wanted something in return?

213
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,670
You are an intelligent person.

214
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,360
You should already know what I want, don't you?

215
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
I don't want to hear it. Why must you also do this to me?

216
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,090
Your Majesty, isn't it obvious what Yi I Cheom desires?

217
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,220
The reconstruction of the palace is far more important than the moving of the grave.

218
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,130
Please make a deal with Yi I Cheom.

219
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,160
Shouldn't you give up a little to gain a lot, Your Majesty?

220
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,230
Didn't I say I did not want to hear it? Get away from my sight at once!

221
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,860
 Sa So Chwi Dae - Giving up in smaller matters in order to acquire greater gain.

222
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,980
Your Majesty... how could I not notice...

223
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,770
that your spirit is in much turmoil...

224
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,930
as a result of Princess Hwa In's death?

225
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,740
But that man, Yi I Cheom...

226
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,140
will have prepared all manner of things in anticipation of the grave's transfer.

227
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,640
So we must prepare for our next move.

228
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,550
After you make a deal with him and lower his guard,

229
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,020
you must stab him in the back.

230
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,500
Your Majesty ...

231
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,380
Call Yi I Cheom here.

232
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,600
I did my part. So give me the confessions as promised.

233
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,840
 If you force him out,

234
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,010
 who will be your sword and shield in the future, Your Majesty?

235
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,120
Let's forget the business with the minister of defense.

236
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,210
If you knead rice cakes, some dough will inevitably get on your hands.

237
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,650
But Your Majesty...

238
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,550
I'm not saying this to take the minister of defense's side.

239
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,950
If I dismiss him, I have to halt the reconstruction of the palace.

240
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,850
I will consult with the other ministers, but—

241
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,780
In turn,

242
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,350
I will halt the grave's transfer.

243
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,170
I ask that you accept my will.

244
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,240
Since Your Majesty's concern for this is so great,

245
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,610
I will do everything I can to convince the Office of the Inspector General

246
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,530
and the other officials.

247
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,700
Thank you. Oh...

248
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,540
There is one other thing I want to discuss with you.

249
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,620
You should be well aware that I owe a debt to the western faction

250
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,470
due to the Eastern Faction's false incrimination of them when I ascended the throne.

251
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

252
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,840
I intend to pay back that debt this time.

253
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,660
Will you help me with this?

254
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,210
 Is he trying to trade the grave's transfer with the western faction's return?

255
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,260
Why don't you answer?

256
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,450
How could I, your servant Yi I Cheom, refuse your personal request?

257
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,480
I will put my soul into carrying out your will, Your Majesty!

258
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,440
You are indeed a loyalist that will go down in history.

259
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,910
I am honored, Your Majesty.

260
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,520
Your Highness!

261
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,420
Oh no, what to do? Since you've been sewing day after day with these precious hands,

262
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,780
there's no way you wouldn't be injured.

263
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,370
You told me to practice when nobody's here.

264
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,400
It's not "Your Highness" but "little sister".

265
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,360
I should be grateful that I'm able to at least do this kind of work.

266
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,400
When it gets colder, there probably won't be sewing jobs, Hyeong-nim*. 
   (said by a bride to the wife of her husband's elder brother)

267
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,840
Wow. You're really optimistic. How can you call me "hyeong-nim" right now?

268
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,430
You must be in a lot of pain, Your Highness.

269
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,100
"Little sister".

270
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,090
"Little sister".

271
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,610
Hyeong-nim.

272
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,420
"Little Sister."

273
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,560
Because Her Highness has been doing sewing work, her finger is all red and swollen.

274
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,460
Just what are you...

275
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,820
Cha Dol's father is at least working as a baggage porter at the harbor.

276
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,980
You just lie down all day then go out at sunset to drink.

277
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,380
Are you human? Are you human?

278
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,690
Follow me! Follow me!

279
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,900
What?

280
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,920
Before I left this village, the work I'd been doing with Hyeong-nim Man Su

281
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,710
was smuggling with the Ming Dynasty.

282
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,260
Smuggling?

283
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,660
So you did stuff like that. But what about the man at the bookstore?

284
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,760
The bookstore was a disguise.

285
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,930
While smuggling, we also brought a few books with us

286
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,900
and if we got caught, we lied saying we bought books.

287
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,080
If only a certain bastard didn't betray and report us,

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,380
all the money in Jemulpo would have been ours. We were doing so well back then.

289
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,980
As if smuggling is something to be proud of!

290
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,350
Then what should I have done? It was impossible to make a living.

291
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,180
My father had been injured during the war and was sick after. Should I just have starved and died?

292
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm reminded of Father again.

293
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,470
So you escaped that place and have been wandering all this time?

294
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,980
I thought I'd be reminded of Father if I came to this village

295
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,230
so I didn't even come near it.

296
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,170
Still, after coming back to my hometown, it feels nice.

297
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,080
The people I worked with back then are still here too.

298
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,920
That's why you've been wandering around all this time...

299
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,910
Look here. If we brought ginseng to Ming,

300
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,440
it will be ten, twenty times the price. We'll then exchange that with silk from Ming.

301
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,550
You know how noblemen go crazy over Ming silk.

302
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,350
We can sell it for five, ten times the price here.

303
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,400
How much is that in total?

304
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,690
Ten times ten is a hundredfold!

305
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,930
What is 100 nyang times 100?

306
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,500
A hundred nyang times a hundred would be... Ten thou—

307
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,230
Ten thousand nyang!

308
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,340
- Ten thousand nyang. 
 - That's right.

309
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,450
You're also a precious person.

310
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,780
Do you feel good, living in poverty like this?

311
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,420
Also, about her highness, who's more precious than anyone ...

312
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,870
Why would she be doing sewing work? Don't you think so too?

313
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,780
By the way, when you left the house,

314
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,220
did you bring something like jewelry?

315
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,750
- No. 
 - You definitely did. I can see it in your eyes.

316
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,840
Ba Wu!

317
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Why are you suffering here for only a few coins?

318
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm asking you to work with me.

319
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,510
Didn't I say I won't be doing work that leaves a bad taste in my mouth?

320
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,250
Crazy bastard!

321
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,250
When did you ever care if it's legal or not?

322
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,600
It's not even funny.

323
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,910
County Clerk, sir!

324
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,440
Hey. Why are you not passing me those?

325
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,540
Why are you not passing them?

326
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,890
Cha Dol! I'm here!

327
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,230
I bought the saury that you like!

328
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,150
Oh. You're in that room. Hey, Ba Wu.

329
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,110
I bought some sauries.

330
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,060
Come in right now.

331
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,670
Why?

332
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,860
I mean... Why is it a bad thing? Nobody got hurt.

333
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,560
I know that private trade is prohibited in the country.

334
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,090
Don't you think there's a reason why it's prohibited?

335
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,730
I mean if you look at any high-ranked nobleman,

336
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,040
they're all wearing silk from Ming.

337
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,110
I was taught even if your lips are crooked, you should always talk straight.

338
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,330
They're the ones who forbade private trades, and aren't they the ones buying them?

339
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,650
Is that what's important?

340
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,970
Ba Wu, just trust me for once.

341
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,350
I'm telling you this will be a big success!

342
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,480
Does the world work like you always want it to?

343
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,790
Should I tell him the secret or not?

344
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,150
This is really a secret. But this time...

345
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,130
Jemulpo magistrate's personnel clerk is involved in this.

346
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,900
On top of that, he's supported by the head of the prefecture!

347
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,800
Surprising, isn't it?

348
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,430
- Hey, roast these sauries. Roast them. 
 - R-roast...

349
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,080
Hey, let's have a drink— wait, not you.

350
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,780
Let's have a drink. Roast them crispy.

351
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,240
Where are these men going?

352
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,850
 Astronomy, Astrology and Meteorology Bureau

353
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,110
This is the rain record for Cheonggyecheon.

354
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,280
One and an eighth inches.

355
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,140
Does it look like we'll get much rain or snow soon?

356
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,470
Good question...

357
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,850
Maybe so...

358
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,980
Are you planning to answer like this when the king asks you?

359
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,770
Wake up.

360
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,070
We're from the office of the inspector general.

361
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,890
- Who is Kim Ja Jeom? 
 - I am. But what's going on?

362
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,880
This is an urgent inspection. So please put down any documents and stand aside.

363
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,930
The Left State Councillor is using the head of the inspector general's office

364
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,120
in order to investigate Kim Ja Jeom.

365
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,650
Shouldn't we stop him?

366
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,200
Why?

367
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,890
Are you trying to protect him because you're the one who recommended him to me?

368
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,710
It's not that, but...

369
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,130
He may have failed last time, but I still think you can use him.

370
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,380
I plan on requesting the Ming to officially recognize my mother's monarch status.

371
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,820
To obtain this without trouble, I will need the left state councillor's help.

372
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,690
I cannot risk difficulties with him over a man who may or may not be of help to me.

373
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,970
I understand.

374
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,890
Think of a way to convince the left state councillor to help me.

375
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,870
If you will give me one more chance, I will not forget your grace.

377
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,260
Thanks to the fact that you couldn't handle Princess Hwa In properly.

378
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,190
I became a laughingstock for recommending you.

379
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,630
I will no longer be a disappointment to you. Please spare me, my lady.

380
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,680
Can I believe you?

381
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,720
If you would only give me the chance, I will do everything I can.

382
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,190
From now on, my life is yours, my lady.

383
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,040
The king intends to join his mother, the Royal Noble Consort Gong's body

384
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,410
in the royal ancestor's shrine.

385
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,630
But this will require the recognition of the Emperor of Ming.

386
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,350
In that case...

387
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,380
shouldn't he simply request for an official recognition of her royal status?

388
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,500
Please think before you speak! Even when he became the crown prince,

389
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,260
don't you recall how they made such a fuss blaming this or that?

390
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,230
It's obvious they're going to use this as an excuse to request more troops and supplies for their war against the Later Jin.

391
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,250
As you're aware, his majesty wishes to remain neutral

392
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,410
in the war between the Jin and Ming.

393
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,540
If you resolve this, even his majesty would change his mind about you.

394
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,480
The newly ascended emperor is deeply preoccupied with carpentry work.

395
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,030
So he left all of his political matters in the hands of his head eunuch Wei Zhongxian.

396
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,230
And who is the only man who has a connection with him?

397
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,780
It's the left state councillor.

398
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,330
Now that you have your lead,

399
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,770
whether you bargain with him or beg on your knees...

400
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,360
I'll leave the means and methods in your hands.

401
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,240
Yes, my lady.

402
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,490
I understand your hands are busy due to the investigation from the inspector general.

403
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,620
Surely you aren't here to beg for your life.

404
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,390
Surely not.

405
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,360
You aren't someone to spare someone because he asked for it.

406
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,400
I came here to bargain with you.

407
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,670
-Bargain? 
 - Yes.

408
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,380
If you will hear my request,

409
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,120
I will tell you a secret you don't know.

410
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,070
Let's hear your request first.

411
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,680
Please accept the request to have his majesty's mother officially recognized as a monarch.

412
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,900
By that you mean that you want me to convince Head Eunuch Wei Zhongxian?

413
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,860
Yes, that is correct.

414
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,510
I must first receive the eunuch's informal consent

415
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,200
before you tell me this secret.

416
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,030
What if it turns out that secret was worthless?

417
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,970
Your hand is already squeezing my throat.

418
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,110
What else could I say?

419
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,270
It is a secret you must know at all costs.

420
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,160
What will you do?

421
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,450
Will you... make a deal with me?

422
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,510
You seem to have finally come to your senses.

423
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,060
I'm sorry.

424
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,060
I won't... ask for your forgiveness.

425
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,620
But if you would just watch me.

426
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,300
I will prove to you

427
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,340
that I'm no longer the person I was before

428
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,360
and that I can be the son you want me to be.

429
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,570
It is getting windy. Let's go inside.

430
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,840
You come in too.

431
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,430
What do you think?

432
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,200
How about lying to Kim Ja Jeom that Head Eunuch Wei promised Ming's approval?

433
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,890
That is a bad plan.

434
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,970
The leader's words must be as weighty as gold.

435
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,150
You are the leader of the great north.

436
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,730
If you so flippantly give away promises,

437
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,690
who would believe and follow you?

438
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,220
We need a fortune in order to persuade Eunuch Wei.

439
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,040
Then, only Kim Ja Jeom will take the credit for it. Why would we do such a thing?

440
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,860
Even a large dike will crumble because of a tiny fault.

441
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,850
No matter how small the secret,

442
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,430
if it can prevent an even larger catastrophe,

443
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,800
would even a thousand gold coins be too much?

444
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,980
I didn't mean that our wealth would be wasted,

445
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,750
it's that I didn't want it to be spent on needless things.

446
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,310
Don't be too attached to wealth.

447
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,670
If you have power, the people will gather.

448
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,350
And if the people gather, the wealth will naturally follow.

449
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,410
I will heed your wisdom, Father.

450
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,460
There is a boat that's leaving soon for Ming. I will send Eunuch Wei a letter.

451
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,050
Prepare a gift to go along with the letter.

452
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,420
Yes.

453
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,000
If you have nothing to do, go to the marketplace and at least work as a storyteller.

454
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,630
Pine caterpillars need to feed on pine needles.

455
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,280
Wouldn't I lose face if I spend my days reading novels in the marketplace?

456
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,080
As if you had any face to save!

457
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,990
Oh right.

458
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,980
I heard your sister-in-law's drawing skill is extra-ordinary.

459
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,410
Has she no interest in doing it professionally?

460
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,380
For the book "Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles"?

461
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,830
- No. Erotica. 
 - Are you insane?

462
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,950
Hey, this will bring money, I tell you!

463
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,120
Even if there are people who have never seen it before,

464
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,220
there's no one who is content with only seeing such erotic love once!

465
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,840
My brother is the kind of person who would burn this whole place down for hearing such a thing.

466
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,780
If you want to live long, you won't speak a word of this around him. Got it?!

467
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,630
Got it? How dare you raise your tone to me?!

468
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,060
Hyeong-nim!

469
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,270
When did I say "got it?!" like that?

470
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,550
I asked "Do you understand?" like that. You're always so full of anger.

471
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
Just wait a little longer. Once the boats arrive in Jemulpo,

472
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,500
then it's the end of unhappiness and the beginning of happiness!

473
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,460
I'm not eating this anymore.

474
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,990
Hey Ba Wu.

475
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,520
Hey, Ba Woo. Isn't there anything you want?

476
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,020
Father.

477
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,380
Why are you out in the rain instead of sleeping?

478
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,880
It's leaking rain in the living room.

479
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,390
What?

480
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,830
Ugh... that blasted rain.

481
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,770
Ah cold!

482
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,310
There is water dropping.

483
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:28,200
 ♫ The night that darkness swallowed light ♫

484
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,940
Move over to the side a little.

485
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:42,270
 ♫ Even the moon is hidden behind clouds ♫

486
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,410
 ♫ Wandering here and there  ♫

487
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,840
It's raining too much, so I think we'll have to sleep like this for tonight.

488
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,520
I should've fixed this sooner.

489
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,200
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,560
Not at all. You were also busy, weren't you?

491
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,940
Oh, you should sleep in my room for tonight.

492
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,850
Hyeong-nim and I will sleep here.

493
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm really fine, so don't worry about me.

494
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,330
When will we get another chance to sleep in a leaky room like this?

495
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,170
Is this also... one of your first experiences?

496
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,960
Perhaps?

497
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,150
It may be another elegant experience.

498
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,720
- I ought to... 
 - Ow! Ow!

499
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,530
Oh, my poor noggin! Oh please don't hurt me!

500
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,240
What do we do now?

501
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,060
Ow! Ow that hurt! Really!

502
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,480
Really. Ow!

503
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,660
Court Lady Jo, you're laughing a little...

504
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,820
What's wrong with the way I laugh?

505
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,610
Why do you keep laughing like that?

506
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,780
Chun Bae! Where is that bastard?!

507
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,450
Chun Bae! You better come out right now, you churl!

508
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,050
What's with this ruckus so early in the morning?

509
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,590
- Please be quiet. You'll wake the whole village. 
 - Let them wake up!

510
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,670
Chun Bae! You better come out this instant, you churl!

511
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,800
Oh, Hyeong-nim. What brings you here so early—

512
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,640
- You! What are you going to do about my money? My money! 
 - What money?

513
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,520
The money that you said you'd grow for me. What are you going to do about it?!

514
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,730
- When the boats come in— 
 - Those boats! They were all wrecked in a tempest last night.

515
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,100
So what are you going to do with my money, you churl?!

516
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,390
What are you talking about?

517
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,690
Do you know how precious that money was?

518
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,560
I sacrificed so much to save that money!

519
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,640
That crazy fool! That accursed fool!

520
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,480
Wh-what is the meaning of this?

521
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,970
You all are in it together with Chun Bae, aren't you?

522
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,020
If you don't pay me my money, you're all finished too!

523
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,050
I'll sell you all off as slaves if I have to!

524
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,330
You make sure to pay me back. Got it?!

525
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,830
L-let's first go out and talk.

526
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:47,070
This is my house, why should I go out? You all leave. Pack your bags now!

527
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,240
Why are you moping around like this?

528
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,440
It could be that the ships are behind schedule and haven't arrived yet. Or maybe he saw the wrong ones.

529
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,590
Hyeong-nim!

530
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,980
That was indeed the boat I was waiting for.

531
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,460
A passing ship rescued one of the survivors.

532
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,260
And he was on the boat I was expecting.

533
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,290
Who was that?

534
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,570
They don't know who it is.

535
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:41,920
But, he must've been severely hurt. He's barely breathing.

536
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,670
Ba Wu... what should I do? Should I just die?

537
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,060
Don't worry, all right?

538
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,660
Hyeong-nim, I will repay you, even if it kills me. All right?

539
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,880
Whether it's storytelling or whatever, I'll do it.

540
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,580
I, too, will do whatever I can to repay you.

541
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,890
I'll even work as your servant to pay it off. So please believe us.

542
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,190
Are you serious?

543
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,760
Yes.

544
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,980
Your wife... was good at drawing I heard.

545
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,990
Draw just one book of erotica. Then I'll pretend this didn't happen!

546
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,560
What?

547
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,680
Hey you crazy fool! I told you that was off-limits!

548
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,790
Then I will have to report that you bilked me of all my money!

549
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,190
I'm sure your wife would be thrilled to be in prison instead of drawing erotica.

550
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,690
Don't forget it. I will never just let this go.

551
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
What happened?

552
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,690
The negotiations went well, and we were able to buy some time, so don't worry.

553
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,630
I just want to take that fool and just—!

554
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,200
What happened to Mr. Chun Bae?

555
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,820
Oh... he'll be right here.

556
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,550
- Did you find something? 
 - Well, the thing is...

557
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,800
The original artist of the erotica...

558
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,490
got a job working for the government, so I guess he refuses to do that kind of work anymore.

559
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,390
Man Su's business is a bookstore on the surface,

560
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,080
but he actually made a living off those erotic novels.

561
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,980
Now that he no longer has an artist, he's become desperate.

562
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,590
Ba Wu...

563
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,410
Absolutely not! Don't you dare speak a peep of this to the princess.

564
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,390
I got it. Of  course I can't speak a peep of this to her. That's trouble.

565
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,120
Hey, look at this.

566
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,060
- The "Bright Mind Precious Mirror"? 
 - Just look.

567
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,450
 "Bright Mind Precious Mirror"  
  (Collection of aphorisms from Chinese classics)

568
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,260
Ah! It's an erotic book! Why are you carrying crap like this around?

569
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,590
This is a precious item.

570
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:18,190
Hey, Ba Wu. Let's just draw them between the two of us.

571
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,100
Is erotica that hard?

572
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,330
If you copy enough of them, I'm sure you'll eventually get a good one.

573
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,940
Next.

574
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,220
Thank you for your work.

575
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,110
Next.

576
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,520
You worked a lot.

577
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,560
Good work!

578
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,930
Ba Wu... should we just... run away?

579
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,090
Where to?

580
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:32,330
Wherever. We should be able to earn our living.

581
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,920
You said this place was your home.

582
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,360
Let's try to hang on for just a little longer. Maybe we'll come up with a solution to this.

583
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,580
I guess I should try drawing this again.

584
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,220
Did you scrape that off again to give Cha Dol some scorched rice? You're too considerate.

585
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,850
Isn't he at an age where he's always hungry?

586
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,430
- Cha Dol! 
 - Oh, he left not too long ago.

587
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,220
But why do you have two bowls?

588
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,350
I found I had more than I needed. I thought I'd share it with the other room.

589
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,830
Ah... yes.

590
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,820
They should clean this place up. It's practically a pig sty.

591
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,330
 " Bright Mind Precious Mirror"

592
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,420
They translated this book in Hangul*? 
 (Korean script. The original was in Chinese)

593
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,130
Oh my! Oh my!

594
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,950
What happened?

595
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,620
What a foul, vulgar pervert he is!

596
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,060
I can't believe you could call such shameful and disgusting things drawings!

597
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,830
Your Highness... Wait. W-wait, wait—

598
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,360
What—

599
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,200
- Don't look. 
 - No, I just need to know what you're talking ab—

600
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,580
- Don't even try to know. 
 - Your Highness.

601
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,430
I must immediately wash my eyes.

602
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,290
It's cold... why are you outside?

603
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,630
You're even less than scorched rice.

604
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,290
Wait... she said she was going to wash her eyes...

605
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,290
Why is she acting that way? And what does she mean with scorched rice?

606
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,530
I have no idea.

607
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,790
Come here. Come here. You caused all that ruckus and you!

608
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,690
- Court Lady Jo... please let's use words. 
 - I'll speak with this.

609
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,120
Let's use words, please. Court Lady Jo.

610
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,220
- Court Lady Jo... just ... ow! 
 - I have words to say to you, so follow me.

611
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,860
- Words, please! 
 - Shut it and follow me!

612
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,720
But what does that mean?

613
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,860
What? Erotica?

614
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,570
Please wait. My dear, my dear.

615
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,260
Will you not get your filthy hands off of me?

616
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,920
- My dear... 
 - Who are you calling "dear"?

617
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,270
My dear, don't be like that. Just spare me this once. Just this once!

618
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,200
Just once. I'll beg you like this!

619
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,150
The bookstore owner wants me?

620
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,070
Yes...

621
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,260
Whether he gets sold off as a slave or taken as prisoner,

622
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,360
this is all on that fool, Chun Bae, so I'm sure they'll handle it on their own.

623
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,610
Please don't worry too much.

624
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,220
Your Highness, your hands are like ice.

625
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,480
Please go inside.

626
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,290
Nanny, that painting,

627
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,380
is something I must draw.

628
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,440
Your Highness, even if that were the case, how would you—

629
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,920
Nanny. Didn't I once say

630
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,460
I am no longer the princess, but a commoner.

631
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:56,430
Were I truly a commoner and my family risked  eviction,

632
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,760
would I be hesitating in this way just to save face?

633
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,320
Your Highness.

634
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,300
Nanny.

635
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,040
Why make a promise, if she was going to do this? She surely said she would draw it.

636
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,450
It's not that she won't draw it, it's that she can't.

637
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,930
What do you mean can't? Is there a problem?

638
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,080
Her Highness

639
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,980
doesn't know men.

640
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,940
What do you mean she doesn't know men? What does that mean?

641
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,400
She's not just a simple widow; her husband died before the marriage.

642
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,100
What? Before the marria—

643
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,700
She became widowed before the marriage?

644
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,110
On the day before the marriage, her future husband met a sudden death.

645
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,290
She never got to see her husband's face,

646
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:35,970
but she lived with her husband's parents and was abandoned by both families?

647
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,810
This is so unfortunate, so unfortunate.

648
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,060
And whose fault is it? You created these troubles again!

649
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,560
All right, all right. I'll do better.

650
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,540
Then do you also not know?

651
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,560
Know what?

652
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,700
Men?

653
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,940
Come to your senses!

654
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,570
That's not what I mean.

655
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,610
If you know, then you can teach her.

656
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:07,550
You worthless fool. Is that something that can be explained through words?

657
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,520
That's true.

658
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,720
Does the palace not teach you things like that?

659
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:20,030
When preparing to receive His Majesty's favors, palace maidens of the royal sleeping quarters receive different education by older court ladies.

660
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,640
Then, things that are difficult to tell are explained using erotic books—

661
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,210
Erotic books!

662
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,740
Yes, erotic books.

663
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,000
Wait an instant, I will go get some right away.

664
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:38,470
Wait, does that mean you know about men or not?

665
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,830
I'll be back.

666
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:46,380
Why that little— When will he come to his senses?

667
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,010
Father!

668
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,970
Why did you come here?

669
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,230
They told me to sleep with you.

670
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,780
Why, all of a sudden?

671
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,500
Why do you want to know?

672
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,350
I'm sure there's something between the ladies.

673
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,020
Let's go to sleep now.

674
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,910
Come here. Close your eyes.

675
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,840
Hey, why are you turning off the lights?

676
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,320
Be quiet so I can sleep!

677
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,100
 "Bright Mind Precious Mirror"

678
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,450
How can such indecent drawings exist?

679
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,120
Take it away this instant and burn it.

680
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,830
Yes, I understand.

681
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,320
Wait. I need to take another look.

682
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,280
Yes, Your Highness.

683
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,280
This is such an impudent drawing.

684
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,460
It is.

685
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,290
Yes.

686
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,150
This one is impudent as well.

687
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,050
This one is worse.

688
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,290
This knave's posture is impudent, too.

689
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,610
How can all these be so graphically impudent?

690
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,780
Move it slowly.

691
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,950
I need to see it carefully so I can copy it.

692
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,660
Yes. Of course.

693
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,350
Please take a close look.

694
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,740
Since we're at it, let's just start from the beginning.

695
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,490
I'm sorry?

696
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,070
The sage says one reaches understanding after a hundred perusals.

697
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,270
I must peruse it a hundred times to grasp the true flavor—

698
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,350
I mean, the true meaning...

699
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,320
Or rather, to truly learn the art.

700
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,360
Yes of course.

701
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,450
The words of the sages are most valuable.

702
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,830
From the beginning.

703
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,350
I'm coming in.

704
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,970
Are you hurt?

705
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,420
She isn't feeling well so she's resting on the floor.

706
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,050
Don't worry.

707
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:34,080
But is she the kind of person who would be spread out on the floor like this just because she's a little sick?

708
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,230
Why do you keep nitpicking with her?

709
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,550
You could just tell yourself that the ladies must be in some sort of situation.

710
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,820
Now leave.

711
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,060
Please leave.

712
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,840
I understand.

713
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,800
Leave.

714
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,990
Your Highness.

715
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,410
You don't think he caught on, do you?

716
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,520
Then shall we take another look?

717
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,110
What?

718
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,050
We should study.

719
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,640
Yes, we should.

720
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,250
I will help you.

721
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,980
I'll turn the page.

722
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,300
Shall I turn the page?

723
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,680
We spent the night.

724
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,110
We did. Chun Bae told me not to spend the night.

725
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,010
This is a dangerous item.

726
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:15,040
It's scarier than a tiger's anger and smallpox.

727
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,230
However, I feel that I can't draw this for the life of me. What should we do?

728
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,340
I have not the slightest idea how to proceed.

729
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:29,730
What about imagining it in your head first?

730
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,830
Imagining?

731
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:38,830
Picture in your head that a passionate man and woman longing for each other just met.

732
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,090
The gaze of the man staring at the woman

733
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,560
suddenly pulled her in and he said ...

734
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,160
You pictured it, didn't you?

735
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,330
No. Never.

736
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,920
What do you mean no?

737
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,590
Yes, we'll say you didn't.

738
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,590
I have to prepare breakfast.

739
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,960
R-Right.

740
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,990
I wonder what she imagined.

741
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:33,850
It's me.

742
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,670
Yes, Father.

743
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,270
You have been away from your studies for some time.

744
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,440
Didn't I tell you I would change?

745
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,490
I am thinking of taking the civil service examination.

746
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:51,990
I have something to discuss with you once I am finished with my duty today.

747
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:55,760
- Don't go outside and stay home. 
 - Yes.

748
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,130
But... what's going on?

749
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,070
I've decided to meet Kim Ja Jeom.

750
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,990
This is a letter attesting to Eunuch Wei's informal consent.

751
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,260
This letter must be delivered in person to Eunuch Wei,

752
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,540
for the approval to be valid.

753
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,190
You're quite thorough.

754
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,600
Now... tell me what your secret is.

755
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,910
If it is useful, this letter is yours.

756
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,760
if not... I will burn it.

757
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,180
The eldest grandson of Kim Je Nam is alive.

758
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,340
Was that all?

759
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,910
If that man was the person who bossam'ed Princess Hwa In, do you still think "that was all"?

760
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,940
Are you sure this is undeniable truth?

761
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,470
I have heard it from his lips, so I am certain.

762
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:59,130
If not... you can have my head.

763
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,360
I guess I can take this now?

764
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,220
Are you sure we can trust Kim Ja Jeom's words?

765
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,970
We have no evidence. Only what he says, right?

766
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,630
Do you not believe Father's judgment?

767
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,160
It's not that.

768
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,390
The issue is important enough for us to carefully examine it before we proceed.

769
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,290
Let's plan our next steps assuming it's true for now.

770
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,700
Yes...

771
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,880
We must find and kill him.

772
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:44,200
If he is Kim Je Nam's grandson, it's certain that he bossam'ed the princess in order to take vengeance on our family.

773
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,930
To think you played into his hands without knowing that!

774
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,360
Pathetic fool!

775
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,700
That is enough.

776
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:57,280
I heard his mother and younger sister were sent to be slave servants.

777
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,060
Do you know where they are now?

778
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,940
Tae Chul should know.

779
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,310
But Tae Chul is...

780
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,870
He's currently at Jemulpo for that other business.

781
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,880
Send someone to Jemulpo at once.

782
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,120
Yes, Father.

783
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,650
May I ask what that "other business" hyeong-nim was referring to?

784
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:30,190
It is better that as few people know about secrets as possible.

785
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:33,730
I will tell you when the time is right.

786
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:36,020
Yes.

787
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,250
Are you disappointed?

788
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:41,970
Not at all. I understand I'm still lacking.

789
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,350
I just feel sorry.

790
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,430
Ba Wu. Ba Wu!

791
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:55,940
What's the matter?

792
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,120
They say it's Geo Jeong. Geo Jeong was the survivor.

793
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,580
Hyeong-nim Geo Jeong? Where is he now?

794
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,560
Nobody knows.

795
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,060
He disappeared as soon as he regained consciousness.

796
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,260
Disappear? Why?

797
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,030
I don't know for sure.

798
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:14,460
The physician said his knife wounds were serious.

799
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,890
Knife?

800
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,510
Ba Wu... what's going on?

801
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,630
Hyeong-nim, don't spend time anywhere else. Just go straight home.

802
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:26,340
I think something is up.

803
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,560
Ba Wu!

804
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,960
Hyeong-nim!

805
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,130
What happened exactly?

806
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,730
As you can see...

807
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:41,960
Where is the boat?

808
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,350
It's all wrecked.

809
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,910
Ba Wu, flee Jemulpo at once. You might be in danger too.

810
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,300
Explain it to me clearly. What exactly happened?

811
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,160
I have to flee too.

812
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,330
Don't ask me any more questions. Just go.

813
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:17,520
 This is really a secret. But this time, Jemulpo magistrate's personnel clerk is involved.

814
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,960
 Lord County Clerk!

815
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,680
I am telling you the truth!

816
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,850
Buy this, too.

817
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:39,330
Spare me. Please spare me!

818
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,680
Where is the man who survived the shipwreck?

819
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,360
Please spare me!

820
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,970
Search the place.

821
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,360
It's empty. Should we track him?

822
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,020
Make sure to find and kill him.

823
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,860
What exactly is happening? Why are those men here?

824
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,990
It's better you don't know! You're only putting yourself in danger!

825
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,790
Hyeong-nim, do you have a place to go?

826
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:35,190
I'll have to find one.

827
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:39,380
You know the house I used to live in at the foot of Namsan?

828
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,560
Go there for now.

829
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,400
Now hurry!

830
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:55,400
To us sailors, ginseng and silk are only subsidiary import products.

831
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:02,050
Hidden underneath that, there were items which nobody should have known about.

832
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:08,300
But we happened to be caught by naval forces not under the head of the prefecture's jurisdiction.

833
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:28,940
It was by the grace of the heavens that a boat happened to pass by and I was barely able to survive.

834
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:34,530
Those bastards seem determined in silencing me through death.

835
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,350
What exactly was on that boat?

836
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,150
Copper and sulfur.

837
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:47,920
Copper and sulfur, that means... these are materials for guns and gunpowder.

838
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,400
If you understand, you should give up while you're ahead.

839
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,740
If you dredge up this matter and make a stir, you will bring trouble on your head.

840
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:13,220
Monk. What brings you here without warning?

841
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,550
I heard your sister is getting married.

842
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,500
Yeon Ok is?

843
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:24,060
She's well past marriage age, and those nobles keep harassing her.

844
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,150
Instead of ruining her life, it's better for her to go with a man she likes while she has one.

845
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:31,720
That's what your mother decided, it looks.

846
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:04,020

847
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,320
The groom and bride bow to each other now!

848
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,130
Halt!

849
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,400
What's going on? What's going on?!

850
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,280
Come here!

851
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,640
Why are you doing this?

852
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Yeon Ok!

853
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:11,320
♫  Please listen to me for a second  ♫

854
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:17,140
♫  Retrace your path and come here.  ♫

855
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:22,820
♫  What are you struggling with?  ♫

856
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,650
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

857
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:29,630
 The criminal is Kim Je Nam's grandson, Kim Dae Seok.

858
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,320
 This is really dangerous.

859
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,230
 It's regarding people important to me.

860
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,690
 We want to dethrone the king and return Joseon to what it should be.

861
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,960
 I transferred the stories that were being told by the court ladies into writing.

862
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,780
 What was the police bureau doing, for such a scandalous book full of rumors to be circulating?

863
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,430
 The style of drawing is familiar.

864
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:51,220
 I have decided this on my own. Don't try to stop me.

865
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,250
 I can't see you like this!

866
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,820
 - Did you find him? 
 - Yes, It looks like they're in Jemulpo.

867
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,770
 Brother-in-law!

868
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,760
 I will no longer shut my eyes on the matter.

869
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,620
 Who are you?

870
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:05,050
 I'm Kim Dae Seok. I'll show you what a real madman is like.
