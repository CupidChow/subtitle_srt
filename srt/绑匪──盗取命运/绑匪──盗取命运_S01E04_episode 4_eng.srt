 Bossam

6
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,720
 Does it really not matter if she dies?!

7
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,630
Are you really not going to go back?

8
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,640
Fine, I'm going  back to her highness,

9
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,420
so do whatever you want!

10
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,140
Damn it all.

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Hey, Son!

12
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,400
Take this. And you wait right here. Understand?

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,360
Are you going to her highness?

14
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,540
 Episode 4

15
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,530
  ♫ There are still words ♫

16
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,210
  ♫ that have been left unsaid ♫

17
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:45,540
 ♫ After much time has passed ♫

18
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,530
 ♫ They scatter like flower petals ♫

19
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,420
 ♫ Without a sound, sorrowfully ♫

20
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,040
 ♫ The new spring wind weeps ♫

21
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,290
 ♫ Although the seasons pass without fail ♫

22
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,100
 ♫ You become another step away ♫

23
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,640
 ♫ The faint memory that blew away with the wind ♫

24
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,550
 ♫ The dream that I woke from ♫

25
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,330
 ♫ The petal of new spring brought by the clouds ♫

26
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:46,020
 ♫ Blooms in my heart ♫

27
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,440
Give me some space.

28
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,590
Father!

29
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,190
Father!

30
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,830
Father!

31
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,080
Cha Dol.

32
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,170
I thought you died without me!

33
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,610
I don't need anything like a mom.

34
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,760
Just please don't die, Father!

35
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,250
I'm not going to die, you runt. Who's dying?

36
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,910
Didn't I tell you that real men don't cry? Now, stop!

37
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,040
I stopped...

38
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,560
Good.

39
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,020
Don't you die, either, Your Highness!

40
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,130
Because of you, my father almost died too!

41
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm sorry, child.

42
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,970
If you're sorry, promise me you'll never do this again.

43
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,740
Now!

44
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,480
I understand.

45
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll promise you.

46
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,110
You're really promising me, right?

47
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,920
That's right.

48
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,900
Father, her highness will get a cold.

49
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,530
Let's hurry and start a fire.

50
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,850
Indeed.

51
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,710
Why didn't you just leave me to die?

52
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,080
My foot slipped.

53
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,850
I was afraid you'd come back as a vengeful spirit. All right?

54
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,810
You always deflect my questions this way.

55
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,080
What will happen to Cha Dol if you die?

56
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,680
My childhood nickname was "Seal".

57
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,050
Why did you try to die?

58
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,190
I must die and disappear

59
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,120
for everyone to relax.

60
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,700
You're dying for someone else?

61
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,770
One hears all sorts of dog crap.

62
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,600
You talk so easily, but what would you know?

63
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,570
Who brought me into this situation?

64
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,200
Did you think I wanted to jump into the water?

65
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,810
Then you should live!

66
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,350
Even if I wanted to live, I can't. I mustn't live!

67
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,870
What would you have me do?

68
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,470
You've completely lost your mind.

69
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,950
I guess the luxury got to your head.

70
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,060
Whether it's your in-laws or the king, forget thinking about others and only live for yourself!

71
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,410
Let them have their petty squabbles. You're already dead!

72
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,020
So why do their situations matter?

73
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,250
From now on live for yourself!

74
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,110
For what should I live for?

75
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,500
I have no reason to live.

76
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,510
What reason do you need to live?

77
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,660
I don't have a reason either. I just live!

78
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,610
It's not just me. This applies to others too. We all just live!

79
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,600
It would have been better, even for your sake, if I had died

80
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,460
Why are you going this far for me?

81
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,350
Why aren't you answering me?

82
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,650
Like you, I...

83
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,430
I'm already a dead person.

84
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,160
What do you mean? You're already a dead person?

85
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,830
Did someone bossam you too, Father?

86
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,710
Like her highness, did Mom bossam you?

87
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,660
And did her father spread rumors that you died and prepare a funeral for you?

88
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,110
- That's not it. 
 - Then what is it?

89
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,190
You don't need to know.

90
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,270
- Where are you going? 
 - To get our luggage!

91
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,390
He always says that. "You don't need to know."

92
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,670
Look here.

93
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,240
That hairpin. How much do you want for it?

94
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,400
Thankfully, no one touched it, so I brought it here.

95
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,500
It's your only possession, so don't lose it.

96
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,930
Also, I picked this up on the way.

97
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,820
Your highness! Hurry and try it on!

98
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,900
Cha Dol, never call her 'your highness' again. There will be trouble if anyone hears.

99
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,260
Then what should I call her?

100
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,930
Well... just...

101
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,970
Just what?

102
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,330
Just don't call her. It's fine if you don't call her.

103
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,970
What should I call you?

104
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,130
When there are other people around,

105
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,380
can I call you... Mom?

106
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,690
Is that all right with you, Your Highness?

107
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,830
Hey! What mom? You call every woman "mom."

108
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,470
When did I? I've never called anyone "mom" except for her highness.

109
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,600
- I really haven't. 
 - Boy!

110
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,490
Then what should I call her?

111
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,080
You won't teach me anything and only keep yelling at me!

112
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,920
You rascal!

113
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,050
Stop.

114
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,430
Call me however you like.

115
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,660
Really?

116
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,300
When other people are around,

117
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,320
you can call me mom. I am fine with it.

118
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,560
Mom!

119
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,730
- Yes, Cha Dol. 
 - Yes, Mom!

120
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,880
Hey! She said only when other people are around.

121
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,970
Only when other people are around. Don't you understand?

122
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,350
Mom.

123
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,360
 Thank you, I ate well.

124
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,420
Welcome!

125
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,750
You can sit here.

126
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
Sit.

127
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,120
You sit too.

128
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,760
- Are you two married? 
 - Well, no, but—

129
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,970
Yes, she's my mom. Isn't she pretty?

130
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,230
Aigoo, that's right.

131
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,400
- You're so lucky!
 - That hurts.

132
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,490
He doesn't look as if he has much money.

133
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,500
I guess he's very strong at night.

134
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,120
Yes.

135
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,160
Really?

136
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,290
No ... I mean he's strong all the time.

137
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,300
Aigoo! Just openly brag about your husband's strength, why don't you?

138
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,520
All of the single women couldn't bear not having a husband like yours.

139
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,320
Enough with the small talk. Just bring us something to eat.

140
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,290
Of course, you have to eat a lot to be strong.

141
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,130
Please wait a moment.

142
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,330
Oh and introduce me to a land broker if you know any.

143
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,190
A slash-and-burn farmer used to live here.

144
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,470
He left during the war, so it's been empty for a long time.

145
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,660
But the columns and crossbeams are fine, so a little bit of elbow grease and it should be livable.

146
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,790
You're not going to show up someday with the house deed to take it back, are you?

147
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,880
Who even owns a house deed in this backwaters countryside?

148
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,710
Whoever moves in first owns the place.

149
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,530
I'll take responsibility, so don't you worry.

150
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,560
It won't be fun if you go back on your word.

151
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,390
I spent half a lifetime on my word alone.

152
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,760
What do you take me for?

153
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,730
What do people do to survive here?

154
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,660
In this tiny town, what else is there to do?

155
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,600
Over there they can catch fish in the river or sell crops to live.

156
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,790
Excuse me, Young Master.

157
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,960
If you're not going to eat, then please let me have some.

158
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,060
Someone's starving to death in front of you, so please have mercy.

159
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,190
Hey, damn Young Master! I'm starving to death over here!

160
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,960
You could at least spare some broth ...

161
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,430
Oh, has Madam Court Lady arrived?

162
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,000
Lady Haeindang is here.

163
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,010
Aunt.

164
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,670
Since you're in a giving mood, why not something to chew on?

165
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,970
Eat well and take care of your health first,

166
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,120
then you'll be able to do whatever you can to help her.

167
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,630
What could I possibly do now?

168
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,440
I can never leave here until Father fulfils his plan.

169
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,930
All the more reason why you should act wisely!

170
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,400
Before she gets into more danger, shouldn't you focus on getting out of here no matter what?

171
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,300
Are you saying you'll do as I say?

172
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,700
Yes. I was short-sighted.

173
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,550
I would like to forget everything, go to Sangwon Temple and study fervently.

174
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,070
Why have you suddenly changed your mind?

175
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,530
It isn't that he's changed his mind; rather, he's come back to his senses.

176
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,600
Before they became in-laws, they were childhood friends.

177
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,490
He just acted out momentarily because he was worried.

178
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm sure he never intended to disobey you.

179
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,700
You've made the right decision.

180
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,060
I didn't do that because I wanted to.

181
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,580
Since it's all for the sake of our family's security,

182
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,160
it's not too late to put aside your personal feelings.

183
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,360
Go and finish your studies.

184
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,570
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

185
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,520
Don't try anything useless.

186
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,910
I'll be watching you.

187
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,580
I need to attend a Buddhist ritual anyway. Let me go with him.

188
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,680
I will watch over him so he doesn't have any other thoughts,

189
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,760
so you don't need to worry about him.

190
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,100
You are the one who should worry.

191
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,130
Even if he causes trouble again,

192
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,930
I am fine with losing one son.

193
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:19,460
But you are different from me, aren't you?

194
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,220
It's me.

195
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,700
Aunt, why are you bringing this personally?

196
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,710
Let's go inside.

197
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,140
I'm sorry.

198
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm only making you worry.

199
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,500
I am so sorry to you I can't say anything.

200
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,660
Are you being sincere?

201
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,080
Then eat quickly.

202
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,710
Make sure nothing is left; you have to eat everything.

203
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,460
Why are you looking at me like that? I said eat quickly.

204
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,290
I'm constantly making you worry,

205
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,900
yet you continue to take care of me.

206
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,950
I don't know how to repay you.

207
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,500
Thank you, Aunt.

208
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,130
However, I have no intention of saving my niece-in-law at the expense of your life.

209
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:33,040
- Aunt... 
 - I will help you until you find her and confirm her safety.

210
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,530
But that's it.

211
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,450
After that, you must return to your place.

212
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,550
If you can promise me that, then I promise I will do my best

213
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:52,350
to make sure niece-in-law makes it away from your father safely.

214
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,910
Where are you going?

215
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,060
Water for the laund—

216
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,490
I'm going to draw some water.

217
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,090
Nonsense! The stream is so far away.

218
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,850
Father!

219
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,880
Let her go.

220
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,540
She needs to do her share.

221
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,050
Until when will you continue to live as a princess?

222
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,250
But still.

223
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,980
I'm leaving.

224
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,740
Where are you going?

225
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,350
To make some money.

226
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,510
Make lots of money!

227
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,730
Do you need a helper?

228
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,840
It looks as if you could use more hands...

229
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,240
I asked if you need a helper!

230
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't need any!

231
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,650
 ♫ You can't leave  ♫

232
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,960
 ♫ and come back again. ♫

233
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,490
 ♫ You pass by one curve, two curves ♫

234
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,050
I said I don't need you!

235
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,580
 ♫ Winter leaves and a new spring is coming ♫

236
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,860
 ♫ Spin round and round in the same place ♫

237
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,400
- Ma'am. 
 - Yeah?

238
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,190
Is there...

239
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,650
anyone playing?

240
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,520
Thank you.

241
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,510
I'll meet your two, and raise you two more!

242
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,060
You must have an ace up your sleeve. You're raising too much!

243
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Aish! You're making me lose my nerve.

244
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,270
The stakes are too low to keep going.

245
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,300
I'll never make a day's wage like this.

246
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,520
Isn't there a place I can hit it big?

247
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,910
Maybe if it were harvesting season. But who has money now?

248
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,860
What's the point of harvesting season?

249
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,100
The landlords take a share, the government takes a share, then there's nothing left!

250
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,000
True, no matter where you look, the money's dried up.

251
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,020
Among the landlords...

252
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,610
is there no one who wants this?

253
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,140
None of us understand the situation of noblemen.

254
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,420
But even if we knew,

255
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,000
do you think they'd include us?

256
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
If you really want to hit it big, go to Hanyang.

257
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:46,900
 ♫ Our life is flowing  ♫

258
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,390
 ♫ Please listen to me for a second ♫

259
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,060
 ♫ Retrace your path and come here. ♫

260
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,740
Damn it.

261
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,620
It might be faster to shave my head and ask for alms.

262
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,650
What do I make a living with?

263
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,460
It's tastier than it looks, isn't it?

264
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,430
Indeed, it's quite tasty.

265
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,960
My father told me,

266
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,210
if you eat radish without passing gas, it's even better for you than ginseng.

267
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,400
That's news to me.

268
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
I know what that means!

269
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,230
It means you've never heard anything like it before, right?

270
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,010
How did you know that?

271
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,310
My father taught it to me a long time ago.

272
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,790
How sagacious.

273
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,700
I know that word too!

274
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,070
It means I'm smart, right?

275
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,130
Where's the food?

276
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,580
We ran out of rice.

277
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,310
Hey Cha Dol.

278
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,270
What did you eat to make you gassy?

279
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,360
It wasn't you?

280
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,420
You can't read the room to save your life, can you?

281
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,010
What should we do from tomorrow, Father?

282
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,510
At daybreak, I'm going to buy some rice. Don't worry.

283
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,080
But we used all of our money. How?

284
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,350
Your father will take care of it.

285
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,880
Just don't nag me about it so much.

286
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,920
Do you think I enjoy nagging you about this?

287
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,360
Father!

288
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,970
- You little ...! 
 - Shh!

289
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,480
Where do you think this is?!

290
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,290
Go home now!

291
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,010
They say it's easier when you help each other, even for carrying a sheet of paper.

292
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,870
This kid is really—!

293
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,090
I told you to go home.

294
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,250
We're the only ones left for each other.

295
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,030
At least I can be your lookout.

296
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,950
It's just this once, all right?

297
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,030
All right. You hurry back.

298
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,500
If we're discovered, you run away no matter what. Understand?

299
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,240
Why are you saying such unlucky things?

300
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,020
You should spit too.

301
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,740
Hurry!

302
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,730
Be careful.

303
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,830
I'm Ba Wu's son, Cha Dol.

304
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,080
Don't you worry!

305
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,100
I heard there was widespread grievance against this man.

306
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
They really hoarded their possessions!

307
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,890
Who's that over there?

308
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,300
Th-thief! Thief! Hey, there's a thief!

309
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,510
Father!

310
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,290
Hey, I told you to run if we were discovered!

311
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,710
We live together and die together!

312
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,830
Your sense of loyalty could get us beaten, boy!

313
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,370
Run!

314
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,190
Hurry! Hurry!

315
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,540
- M-mommy! 
 - Mom!

316
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,850
It's a thief! Thief!

317
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,740
Are you crazy?!

318
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,500
You're the one who's crazy!

319
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,120
Are you so out of options that you're taking Cha Dol to commit thievery?

320
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,040
So, you'd rather we all die?

321
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,130
Father, let's all fight later. We need to hide!

322
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,790
Did you shout just now?

323
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,330
Yes!

324
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,430
Have you seen the thief?

325
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,420
He ran that way. So hurry and get him!

326
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,350
Why aren't you eating?

327
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,380
I'm not in the mood. Eat up.

328
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,480
If she doesn't want to eat, let her be. She has not starved enough.

329
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,100
Father.

330
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,050
Does she still think she's a princess?

331
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,140
Do you intend to mak Cha Dol a thief too?

332
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,880
Then what should I do?

333
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,290
What, should I starve him to death?

334
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,380
You reap what you sow.

335
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,110
What do you think Cha Dol will learn from you?

336
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,820
Haven't you heard that a son learns by watching his father from behind?

337
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,950
I'll take care of my own child, why do you care?

338
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,920
Whether I make him into a thief or not, what's it to you?

339
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,630
Furthermore, do you really think you've become Cha Dol's mom just because he calls you mom?

340
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,420
Sit.

341
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,410
Father.

342
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,200
Eat.

343
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,980
I said eat!

344
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,540
Are you all right? Let me see. Did you get hurt?

345
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,770
I don't know!

346
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,450
Cha Dol, are you all right? Are you hurt?

347
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,290
I said I'll take care of my own child.

348
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,050
Is this taking care of him? Look before you speak.

349
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,650
So what? He's fated to be a thief, because he's a thief's son.

350
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,590
What's so serious about this? He'll climb fences, fall, and break his legs.

351
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,740
While he's fleeing, he'll tumble into sewers, roll, and get hurt!

352
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,600
That's a thief's life. This is nothing—

353
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,790
How dare you! Even if you live a reckless life,

354
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,280
you shouldn't say such words as a father in front of his child.

355
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,970
I'll do what I want! Also, do you think you're all that as a princess?

356
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,770
Who do you think you're raising your voice at?

357
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,500
- Cha Dol, let's wash your hand first. 
 - I'm all right.

358
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,180
I only got hurt slightly, so it'll be all right if I just leave it.

359
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,850
No, even if it's a small wound...

360
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,880
You really don't listen.

361
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,410
Are you his mother?

362
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,710
I said to stop acting like his mother.

363
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,130
And you, don't ever call her "mother" again. Do you understand?

364
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,600
- I said do you understand? 
 - Yes.

365
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,810
Why do you keep taking it out on Cha Dol?

366
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,870
Whether I roast him or boil him is my decision. Stay out of it.

367
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,760
I am doing this because you can't do your job as his father.

368
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,290
Whose fault is it that I became this kind of father? Whose fault is it?

369
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,950
- Are you implying this is my fault?
 - Isn't it?

370
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,220
Of course not! If it weren't for you, something like this never would've happened to me.

371
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,750
- That's why I wanted to part ways. 
 - Didn't you bring me here?

372
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,620
So why did you jump off the cliff in front of me?

373
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,600
Did I ever ask you to save me?

374
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,500
Then you can just go die!

375
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,420
Don't cry, Your Highness.

376
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,620
It's all my fault.

377
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,240
If only I hadn't asked Father to bossam me a mother,

378
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,070
none of this would've happened.

379
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,060
Father, I won't call her mom anymore.

380
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,850
Father, it's all my fault.

381
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,200
Don't tell her highness to die.

382
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,020
Father.

383
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,530
Father.

384
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,660
Her highness won't die. Stop crying.

385
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,020
I told you a man shouldn't cry.

386
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,730
Father was wrong. I mean it.

387
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,900
Do you mean it?

388
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,420
Yes, really.

389
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,240
Then promise me you'll never do that to her highness again.

390
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,910
All right.

391
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:32,220
Hurry and promise me. From the sky to the ground.

392
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,060
From the sky to the ground.

393
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,900
Pinky promise too.

394
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,070
And quickly apologize to her highness.

395
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,120
- Later.
 - Now.

396
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,300
I said I got it, I'm going. I'm going.

397
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,620
Your Highness. Your Highness.

398
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,560
- Your Highness.
 - She probably went to get some fresh air.

399
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,290
But her shoes are here.

400
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,330
- Princess! 
 - Your Highness!

401
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,580
- Princess! 
 - Your Highness!

402
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,200
- Princess! 
 - Your Highness!

403
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,300
Where on earth did she go? Princess!

404
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,690
Your Highness!

405
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,900
Your Highness!

406
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,720
- Princess! 
 - Your Highness!

407
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

408
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,060
I said things I shouldn't have.

409
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,160
"Go and die"? You brute.

410
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,690
It's so cold outside, what is she going to do?

411
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,200
Truly, what will she do?

412
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,890
What are you doing out here by yourself?

413
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,540
Your Highness!

414
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,030
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

415
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,540
What happened to your face?

416
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,380
How dare you lay your hands on me.

417
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,510
Are you out of your mind?

418
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,900
You act as if you know everything in this world. As if you will obey all the rules.

419
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,120
How could you disappear like that without a single word?

420
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,780
Do you not care about the people who worry for you?

421
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,310
Were you worried about me?

422
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,010
No.

423
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,950
Not me, but

424
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,260
Cha Dol. Do you know how worried he was?

425
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,400
He thought something happened to you and hasn't eaten or drunk a single sip of water.

426
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,180
He's been crying all day making a fuss.

427
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,990
If you've caused someone to worry and wait around all day for you,

428
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,660
shouldn't you explain where you've been and what you've been doing?

429
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,930
Or at least make up some excuses?

430
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,240
You said Cha Dol hasn't eaten all day.

431
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,250
We should feed him first.

432
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,940
Cha Dol. Cha Dol! Cha Dol!

433
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,600
Your Highness!

434
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,580
Where were you?

435
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,900
You left your shoes and hair pin,

436
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,510
I really thought something bad happened to you.

437
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,530
I'm sorry. Next time, I'll let you know before I go.

438
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,310
No, take me with you next time.

439
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,630
Promise.

440
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,820
All right, let's do that.

441
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,220
But what happened to your face?

442
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,380
Did you do that to your face on purpose?

443
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,120
And my mourning garments were drawing too much attention.

444
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,360
There happened to be someone who wanted them, so I exchanged clothes with her.

445
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,630
Your highness's clothes should've gotten you something better than that.

446
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,850
Whoever got them hit a gold mine today.

447
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,160
It's not like that.

448
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,320
I don't know the market very well, so I just took what they gave me.

449
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,930
This is what I made while working.

450
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,220
- Really?
 - Yes.

451
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,220
What kind of work can you possibly do?

452
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,880
You think earning money is easy?

453
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Indeed, it wasn't easy at all.

454
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,470
What kind of skills did you show off, exactly?

455
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,350
And where did you get this money from?

456
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,420
Did you perhaps steal?

457
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,410
Didn't I just say I made this while working?

458
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,850
So what kind of work? There are only so many things women and children can do.

459
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,750
I went to a tavern and washed the dishes.

460
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,560
What?

461
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,100
You washed dishes?

462
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,450
Starting tomorrow, I'll start making money.

463
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,100
It won't be a lot, but I'll make enough for the three of us.

464
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,230
So don't make Cha Dol do something awful like stealing ever again.

465
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,090
Your Highness... Even so, you still have your dignity.

466
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,220
Washing dishes is a little...

467
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,530
What's wrong with washing dishes?

468
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,520
And from now on, I'm not "Your Highness",

469
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm going to live as a commoner.

470
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,410
Eat up.

471
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,190
Father.

472
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,570
Hurry and eat.

473
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,960
Don't leave like that again.

474
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,710
What if you get caught by your pursuers?

475
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,850
Don't worry.

476
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,690
They won't ever imagine I'm living like this.

477
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,980
Even if I run into them, they won't recognize me.

478
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,150
That's what you think.

479
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,960
Either way, don't leave.

480
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,910
Shouldn't we at least get food on the table?

481
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,150
Are you trying to start with me right now?

482
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,630
I'm no longer a princess.

483
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,740
I've decided I'm going to live as an ordinary woman from now on.

484
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,070
That's why I took off my mourning clothes and changed into this.

485
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,120
Why, all of a sudden?

486
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:15,070
If I can't die and have to live, this is the only way.

487
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,220
And even though I'm not Cha Dol's mother,

488
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,720
he shouldn't get hurt because of me.

489
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,950
This is the only thing I can do.

490
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,300
So... you're going back to the tavern again?

491
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,110
The innkeeper said there will always be dishes to—

492
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,810
Screw the dishes!

493
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,400
I said I'll figure out how to make a living.

494
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,650
- Are you going to steal again?
 - I said I won't!

495
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,760
I won't.

496
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,320
You always ignore people.

497
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,650
Anyway, we're doing what I say.

498
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,050
If I don't go back to the tavern, promise you'll never commit thievery again.

499
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,230
Can you swear it upon all of the gods under the heavens?

500
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,110
Of course.

501
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,320
Then I'm satisfied.

502
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,970
Spouting all kinds of nonsense.

503
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,370
Are you all right?

504
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,060
Are you all right?

505
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,560
I was getting some scorched rice tea and my hands slipped.

506
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,730
Go on up. I'll pour some scorched rice tea for you.

507
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,870
That's all right, I'll clean it up.

508
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,710
- I said I'll do it. 
 - Forget it.

509
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,880
I will clean this. Go on up.

510
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,960
Cha Dol, you too.

511
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,800
Your Highness, this one too.

512
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,200
Wow, there are so many stitches. It's completely in tatters!

513
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,450
So does it look bad?

514
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:21,100
Not at all! Because you're wearing it, it doesn't look at all in tatters.

515
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,430
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

516
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,700
Whatever the clothes, if you wear them, they become like fairy clothes.

517
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,180
How could such rags be like fairy clothes?

518
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,540
Why not? If a fairy is wearing it, then it's fairy clothes!

519
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,540
The world is just overrun with fairies, isn't it?

520
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,320
For a fairy to live in the middle of nowhere like this.

521
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,520
Why are you spouting nonsense so early in the day?

522
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,860
What did I say?

523
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,480
Never mind. Let's just say she's a fairy.

524
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,090
If not, then that means my son is lying.

525
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:57,030
Or it makes him a dumb fool that can't distinguish between a person and a fairy.

526
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,710
Why are you being like this to me?

527
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,420
What did I do?

528
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,450
You have to be patient, Your Highness.

529
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,880
He felt angry at himself for spending all day yesterday worrying about you, so he's taking revenge.

530
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,360
Hey what do you mean revenge? How childish.

531
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,560
You're normally childish, Father.

532
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,720
You're really pitiable. Hearing words like that from your own son.

533
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,920
I don't care. I always hear it.

534
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,760
Are you on your way to do laundry?

535
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,950
Do you know how to do laundry?

536
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,140
But then again, clothes don't break like dishes.

537
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,450
You said we were going to pick herbs. Let's go.

538
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,010
Your Highness.

539
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,570
Use this to hit the clothes.

540
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,610
Easy, right?

541
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,070
Be safe.

542
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,570
The most useless fool. An impertinent fool!

543
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,750
A good-for-nothing fool!

544
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,650
Did you hear?

545
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,910
Did you hear?

546
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,120
What?

547
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,650
What?

548
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,030
Oh my!

549
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:16,020
Really! I mean some fellow slipped in like a ghost,

550
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,610
and cleaned the whole house up!

551
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,400
That's so refreshing to hear!

552
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,190
I don't know how that is, but he sure did a good job!

553
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,610
He'll be blessed.

554
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,970
 What? He'll be blessed?

555
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,780
Of course he should be blessed! He turned a rich man into a poor one!

556
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,130
You silly woman. That wasn't just any rich man,

557
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,720
but an evil one who deserves divine punishment!

558
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,010
That's right. That's right.

559
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,390
I mean, that kind of person could deserve worse punishment than losing all of his possessions.

560
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,600
That wretched nobleman.

561
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,990
All this time, how much did he eat from the backs of our hard labor?

562
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,550
Who said he didn't?

563
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,670
I just felt so refreshed!

564
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:55,240
 Is this why the story of Hong Gil Dong* was so popular? 
 (Korean Robin Hood)

565
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,150
I'm going to visit that house later today to enjoy hearing them weep!

566
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,620
That's what I'm saying!

567
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,750
That would clear up ten years' worth of indigestion!

568
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,500
 I didn't know.

569
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,350
 I was really living under a rock.

570
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,580
 Have I been a frog in a well this whole time? 
  (From the proverb "the frog only knows the well he lives in")

571
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,030
Innkeeper!

572
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,100
It's hot!

573
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,770
Good work today. Here.

574
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,570
Take this.

575
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,920
Thank you.

576
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,780
You want to leave the temple now?

577
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,090
What are you going to do if this happens to reach your father's ears?

578
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,190
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

579
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,380
More than that, while I'm gone—

580
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,580
If you're talking about the men who were following you,

581
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,340
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

582
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,590
More importantly, how are you going to find my niece-in-law?

583
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,550
You said you don't have any leads.

584
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,100
If I look for the men my father sent out to find her,

585
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,420
I will be able to find a clue.

586
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,160
I'll be off, Aunt.

587
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:06,960
Yes. Be careful so you don't get hurt.

588
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,270
This hole is so big.

589
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,480
What on earth did you do to the clothes?

590
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,900
There was so much grime coming off it, so I had to hammer it for a long while...

591
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,330
You sure are strong.

592
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,940
Doesn't the princess know that too much can be worse than too little?

593
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,350
What's that mean?

594
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,370
I'm saying that lady has broad arms.

595
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,210
Do you intend to teach him such nonsense?

596
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,230
What does it matter? It's not like the thief's son is going to take the civil servant's exam.

597
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,980
I'm sorry.

598
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,210
My father holds grudges,

599
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,590
- and is a bit pathetic.
 - Hey!

600
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,890
Why are you yelling at him?

601
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,460
He didn't say anything wrong.

602
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,740
Right, Cha Dol?

603
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,790
Father, where are you going?

604
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,010
The market is held today, so I'm going to buy some stuff. Why?

605
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,230
We're selling eggs. Get your eggs.

606
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,560
We're selling eggs.

607
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,100
It's dried well, please take a look.

608
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,390
I have dried seaweed, too.

609
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,190
What are you doing?

610
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,210
Father! These bunnies!

611
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,470
Damn.

612
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,040
It is dried so well.

613
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,400
This tastes good. It dried well.

614
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,050
Please take a look.

615
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,570
It dried so well.

616
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,390
Can you give me a discount?

617
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,480
This looks good on you.

618
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,380
It really fits you well!

619
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,200
How much are these?

620
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,750
These really are delicious!

621
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,530
Come buy some taffy.

622
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,810
Please look at these.

623
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,160
Please come.

624
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,510
Are you that happy?

625
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,330
Yes, Ong-Jja!

626
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,020
What? Ong-Jja?

627
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,330
Yes, from "Ong" from the word for "princess" and "Jja" from the word for "your highness".

628
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:07,020
Ong-Jja! It's great isn't it?

629
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,120
What kind of name is Ong-Jja?

630
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,820
Why does it matter?

631
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,880
It's fine as long as Cha Dol and I like it.

632
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,450
Isn't that right, Cha Dol?

633
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,130
Yes, Ong-Jja!

634
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,160
Like it, my foot.

635
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,760
It's not like you're a barbarian or something. What kind of nonsense word is "Ong-jja"?

636
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,060
Isn't that so Miss Ong-Jja?

637
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,640
It's only a name I'll let Cha Dol use, so you don't get to call me that.

638
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,800
I have no desire to call you that!

639
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,400
Why is this A-frame so darn heavy?!

640
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,600
My father is pouting again.

641
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,960
Let's go together, Father!

642
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,470
Just pick one of the two.

643
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,840
You want to cook or do the laundry?

644
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,150
Father, Father! I want to do it.

645
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,480
Isn't it taking her too long?

646
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,720
The soup's going to go cold. Let's hurry and eat.

647
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,240
What's wrong?

648
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,980
I will make it again!

649
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,020
Please don't kill us!

650
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,240
Have you found her?

651
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,390
They're hiding in the Wollong Mountains in Paju.

653
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,120
And the Left State Councillor?

654
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,310
It doesn't seem he knows yet.

655
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,770
What should I do?

656
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:52,420
Your Majesty, Left State Councillor and the Six Ministers of Joseon seek your royal audience.

657
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,790
What is your reason for opposing the uniform land tax law from being applied nationwide?

658
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,500
If we accept rice as tax payments,

659
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,360
the cost of moving all of that to Hanyang will be too great.

660
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,990
Just thinking how much food we'd lose during transport or rot during preservation ...

661
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,250
I cannot even imagine the loss.

662
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,830
Even Chancellor Wang Anshi's reform laws during the Song Dynasty

663
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,380
began with good intentions,

664
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:42,050
but please understand that it only resulted in a great catastrophe, Your Majesty.

665
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,260
Left State Councillor, your opinions only sound to me

666
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,220
like support for landowners and the merchants who trade for the tribute.

667
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,420
It would be better for our current state of affairs

668
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,650
to strengthen the Identification Tag law instead.

669
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,380
If we prevent the people from wandering,

670
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,010
the taxes will be collected in a more orderly way

671
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:01,150
and our country's finances will slowly improve.

672
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,650
Don't you realize that the Identification Tag law

673
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,710
only makes thieves out of farmers who have no path to survive?

674
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,890
Your Majesty, landowners and the merchants who trade for the tribute are also your people.

675
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,150
We beg that you will hear us.

676
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,610
Are there no other opinions?

677
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,750
I asked if all you lords are in agreement with the Left State Councillor!

678
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,890
Please hear our pleas, Your Majesty!

679
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,050
- Please hear our pleas, Your Majesty! 
 - Please hear our pleas, Your Majesty!

680
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,450
Everyone except the Left State Councillor may leave.

681
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:12,060
Now that I sent everyone away, tell me what you're really thinking.

682
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,920
Tell me your real reason for opposing the uniform land tax laws.

683
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,140
Didn't you agree when I decided to test the application of the uniform land tax law in Gyeonggi Province?

684
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,160
The plan was to get rid of the merchants who trade for the tribute and therefore eliminate the loss of the tribute money

685
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,630
and to collect more taxes from landowners,

686
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,340
to protect the livelihood of the people.

687
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,370
Why do you oppose that?

688
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:35,860
Did you perhaps receive a bribe from landowners and the merchants who trade for the tribute?

689
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,060
Say something!

690
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,300
Yes, I have received them.

691
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:50,450
Have you forgotten that I received those bribes and used them according to Your Majesty's wishes?

692
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,950
What's that? When have I done this?

693
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,620
Was there any money in the Royal Court which we could use to repair Changdeok Palace

694
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,150
and build new palaces? 
  (The king restored the palace burned down during Japanese invasion in 1592)

695
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,850
We were able to use their money to lay

696
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:05,190
the foundation stones for Gyeonghui Palace, Ingyeong Palace, and Jasu Palace

697
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,190
and raise the girders.

698
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,000
If you truly wish to enact the land tax law

699
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,260
you will have to dismiss the official who oversees the palace construction

700
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,020
and halt the construction of the palaces.

701
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,190
That is impossible. The construction of the palaces

702
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,210
is for the purpose of raising the status of the royal family,

703
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,720
which has fallen to the bottom due to the Japanese invasion and to regain legitimacy.

704
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,320
The people who are suffering from the overcollection and multiple collection of taxes

705
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,600
due to the palace construction,

706
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,230
what they want isn't a land tax law

707
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,120
but for the palace construction to stop.

708
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,400
I beg you to listen to us.

709
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,120
I understand.

710
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,710
As you wish, I will not enact the land tax laws.

711
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,240
You may leave.

712
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,320
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

713
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,260
Are you outside, Jung Yeong?

714
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,360
Yes, Your Majesty!

715
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,680
Your Majesty, please calm your wrath, and collect your thoughts.

716
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,770
I fear this will harm your health.

717
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,590
I will call for the royal physician.

718
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,630
I don't need him!

719
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,990
You said you saw Hwa In at Wollong Mountains in Paju, didn't you?

720
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:13,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

721
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,730
Let news leak to the left state councillor's ears that she's there.

722
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,050
He's a man full of suspicions, so don't let the news be very detailed.

723
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,820
Just let him know you saw someone in Paju.

724
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,220
- I understand. 
 - And...

725
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:36,960
Make sure to bring me certain evidence that Hwa In died in his hands.

726
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,000
Father, the market is held today...

727
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,380
No! There are a lot of people out. It's dangerous if someone recognizes us.

728
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,450
It's all right if we go around in secret, Father.

729
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,800
I told you no.

730
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,420
Yes...

731
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,280
What will we have for dinner?

732
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,410
We've run out of food.

733
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,020
- Cha Dol. 
 - Yes!

734
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,350
Go in and get me some water to drink.

735
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,530
Oh right, I need a fine-toothed comb.

736
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,630
If I go to the market, will I find one?

737
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,870
If you really need one, I'll go out and buy one for you.

738
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,750
You don't even know how to pick items.

739
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,550
Your water.

740
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,280
Cha Dol's socks are starting to get holes.

741
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,680
If I am to fix them, I need thread.

742
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,190
And we're out of thread too. What shall we do?

743
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,620
Let's go! We'll go, all right?

744
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,090
We'll go to the market.

745
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,190
You said we couldn't when I asked!

746
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,930
Quiet, boy!

747
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,030
Just get ready to leave.

748
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,610
Cha Dol. Let's get ready to leave, before your father changes his mind.

749
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,170
Aren't you coming?

750
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,780
Please take a look.

751
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,060
Have you seen this man before?

752
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,190
No, I haven't.

753
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,770
Have you seen anyone like this?

754
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,070
I don't know.

755
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,290
Have you seen this person?

756
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,820
Stop!

757
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,960
Have you seen this person?

758
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,130
Look closely!

759
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,540
Well, I don't know...

760
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,400
Brother-in-law!

761
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,950
My eyes were beginning to get blisters  trying to spot you.

762
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:00,720

763
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,790
 What reason do you need to live?

764
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,980
 I don't have a reason either! I just live.

765
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,070
 And it's not just me. This applies to others too. We all just live!

766
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,100
 You can't, Brother-in-law!

767
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,280
 Bossam

768
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,630
 Why do you try to push me to an even more perilous cliff edge?

769
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,380
 Her highness is going to die!

770
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,420
♫  Wake me up  ♫

771
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,500
 So your family reputation is more important to you than a person's life, after all?

772
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,890
 If they call upon death, then I will die instead. 
 ♫ even for a day ♫

773
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,520
 Hwa In is still alive...

774
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,850
 - Should we scam them? 
 - It's not enough to merely scam them.

775
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:40,320
 There is a target that I want to hit. What should I do?

776
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,450
 Have a new picture drawn of my daughter-in-law's face.

777
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,370
 I am Yi Amugae, holding the position of Byeoljwa* in the Royal Private Finance Office.
(assistant administrator)

778
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,130
 Wouldn't this much be enough?

779
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,360
 My lady.

780
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,780
 He said he manages the Royal Private Finance Office.
