1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,500
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,590
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,090
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:33,040

5
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,030
 Bossam

6
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,500
We're leaving this place immediately.

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,950
When your brother-in-law comes, you can leave with him.

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,060
Or you could live with him in that house.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,610
I'll leave that up to you.

10
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,700
Don't you understand?

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,130
I'm saying we should finally part ways.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,270
What is your reason for doing this so suddenly?

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,870
I no longer want to live anxiously because of you.

14
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,320
And even for Cha Dol's sake, I no longer... can live with you.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,400
Is that truly the only reason?

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,080
Didn't you also say that you would leave us when the time was right?

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,900
The young master will now take care of you

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,690
so don't get your life entangled with me anymore

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,080
and let's just go our separate ways without hesitation.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,000
What exactly happened back there?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,360
Don't bottle it up inside and tell me—

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,690
It doesn't matter what happened!

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,250
What does it have to do with you?

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,640
Even if we go our separate ways, I should be the one to leave.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,310
That house is a house that you purchased.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,050
Does it make sense that you and Cha Dol leave?

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,520
Don't be stubborn, and tell me the truth.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,860
Why exactly are you doing this?

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,470
I don't want to spend one more second with you,

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,850
but if I told you to leave, I thought you'd blame it on this or that and not leave!

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,590
I thought you'd make any excuse possible to stay here with us.

32
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,190
So that's why... I'm saying we'll leave first.

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,480
Do you still not understand? Should I be more blunt?

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,380
- I'm sick of seeing you bumbling about— 
 - I got it.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,460
I understand, so stop.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,060
Thank you for everything you've done so far.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,450
- I will repay you for all of this later—  
 - Forget all of that.

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,820
Let's not... see each other again.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,380
 Episode 7

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,790
- You came alone? Where is her highness? 
 - What about Cha Dol?

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,890
Oh h-he's inside. Hey, w-wait!

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,840
Your Highness. Your Highness!

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Hey you! Why are you doing this really?

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,620
I almost passed into the afterlife and barely came back alive.

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,020
Do you need to do this as soon as we're back?

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,190
I told you I was sorry.

47
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,490
Maybe something really has gone wrong back there.

48
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,720
Why are you sitting around like that?

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,300
We're going alone, aren't we? Her highness isn't coming with us, is she?

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,590
Father! You like her too, don't you?

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,920
Let's just live together with her.

52
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,180
- Father! 
 - Let's go.

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,080
Father. We should at least see her face before we go.

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,870
We're never going to see her again. What's the point of seeing her face?

55
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,080
I don't want to! I'm not leaving until I see her face!

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,530
That little...!

57
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,020
Your Highness...

58
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,920
Mom!

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,390
♫ There are still words that have been left unsaid ♫

60
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,990
Please change Father's mind.

61
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,490
Please hold him back so he can't go, mom.

62
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,210
I don't want to go!

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,190
I want to live with you, Mom!

64
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,530
Mom!

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,990
♫ Without a sound, sorrowfully ♫

66
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,820
♫ The new spring wind weeps ♫

67
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,150
- Come here. 
 - I'm not leaving!

68
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,030
Come here!

69
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,650
♫ You become a step farther away ♫

70
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,960
C-court Lady Jo, it looks like there's a story he's keeping from us.

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,960
I will go over there and clear everything up and come back, so wait just a bit, all right?

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,300
This is driving me up the wall, really!

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,420
Oh, oh! Your Highness!

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,830
Y-your Highness, steady yourself.

75
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,190
Let's go in. You're going to faint, Your Highness!

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,610
 ♫ Having made friends with the mooonlight ♫

77
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,850
Those accursed fools!

78
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,000
No matter how much of a hurry they were in, they should've waited for the young master to return.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,430
They're abandoning two helpless women in such a remote place.

80
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,330
And you dare leave? You're leaving us?

81
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,590
They don't even recognize who saved their lives, those ingrates!

82
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,620
♫ They scatter like flower petals ♫

83
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,900
Your Highness, are you all right?

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,120
But why did that child call you "mom"?

85
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,930
- You men go on ahead. 
 - Yes.

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,790
What happened? Did you find out where Dae Yeop is?

87
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,960
I have not yet.

88
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,630
Then where are you off to in such a hurry?

89
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,110
I am on my way to Paju on his excellency's orders.

90
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,750
Why Paju— Is Dae Yeop in Paju?

91
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,790
There was someone who claimed to have seen her highness in Paju a few days ago.

92
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,370
So we received orders to thoroughly search Paju.

93
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,100
But we have yet to hear any news of the young master.

94
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,800
Now, then...

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,320
By chance... if you hear any news about Dae Yeop, could you also let me know?

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,230
Yes.

97
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,120
Thank you.

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,860
Your Highness... what is all this?

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,190
My only possession used to be my mourning clothes.

100
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,290
It seems my luggage has grown since then.

101
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,370
Even if it's just a single outer garment, a pair of socks, and one fine comb.

102
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,790
Oh, and I got a hairpin too.

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,790
If only I had told Royal Consort Yun as I should have...

104
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,160
You wouldn't have had to suffer such hardships.

105
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,770
This is all my fault.

106
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,990
You must have had your own reasons for not telling her.

107
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:34,090
Truthfully, I was threatened they would kill my mother and brother.

108
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,800
Please kill me, Your Highness.

109
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,290
But if you ran away to come here, doesn't that put your mother and brother in danger again?

110
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:48,210
My mother and brother left Hanyang as soon as they were released.

111
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,570
Even I don't know where they are now, so they won't be able to find them either.

112
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,140
That is a relief, but...

113
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,850
It feels like you suffered needless hardships because of me.

114
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm sorry for that.

115
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,430
Of course not, Your Highness!

116
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,990
I deserve a thousand, nay, ten thousand deaths for failing to protect you.

117
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,100
I consider this the will of the heavens for allowing me to serve you again.

118
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,430
And I will serve you for as long as I live as an atonement for my sins.

119
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,980
You must be exhausted from your long journey. Please rest.

120
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,310
From now on, if I'm too exhausted to continue, shouldn't you carry me on your shoulders?

121
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,350
Don't worry, Your Highness.

122
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,750
No matter where it is, I will carry you there.

123
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,960
Cha Dol, go on ahead with Mr. Chun Bae.

124
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,760
Meet with the head monk, I'll be there to see him.

125
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,390
All right.

126
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,910
 (Ba Wu's childhood)

127
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,100
Capture every single one of them!

128
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,990
- Let go! 
 - Capture them!

129
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,510
- What's going on? 
 - Capture them!

130
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,270
What madness is this?

131
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,630
Capture every last one of them!

132
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,150
Yes, sir!

133
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,700
Unhand me!

134
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,190
What are you doing?

135
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,670
Child!  Child! Child!

136
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,880
My Lady! My Lady!

137
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Yi I Cheom, you bastard!

138
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,300
Hyeong-nim!

139
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,320
Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim!

140
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,300
You scum!

141
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,990
Father! Father!

142
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,730
Father!

143
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,220
The criminal  Kim Je Nam has forgotten his place as the father-in-law to the king,

144
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,730
lied about secret orders from the late king,

145
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,440
and then used the dowager queen's authority as a pretext.

146
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,100
In addition! In order to put Grand Prince Yeongchang on the throne, plotted treason against the king.

147
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:50,490
The results of the investigation show that everyone pointed to Kim Je Nam leading this effort.

148
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,430
So there is no reason to doubt his treason.

149
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,570
The court officials were equally critical,

150
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,320
so there was general consensus agreeing to his beheading.

151
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,190
Behead the ringleader of the treason, Kim Je Nam!

152
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,060
Grandfather...

153
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,570
Father...

154
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,600
My uncles...

155
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,510
Please be reborn in the pure land of bliss.

156
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,870
As long as I live,

157
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,220
I will make sure to avenge you, grandfather.

158
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,590
Please watch over me!

159
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,020
Grandfather!

160
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,240
 (The present).

161
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:07,110
♫  Are you leaving, are you leaving me?  ♫

162
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:17,440
♫  You can't leave and come back again  ♫

163
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,020
Ba Wu. 
 ♫   Eheradiya it flows  ♫

164
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,890
Hey, Ba Wu! 
 ♫  Gently flowing  ♫

165
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,200
♫  along the river it flows  ♫

166
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,140
♫  Eheradiya it flows  ♫

167
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:44,580
♫   our life is flowing  ♫

168
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,740
I even considered murdering her.

169
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,590
But in the end...

170
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,000
I couldn't kill her.

171
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,390
I even thought about selling her to traveling merchants.

172
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,650
No... I did sell her.

173
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,930
And that troubled you, so you brought her back.

174
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
You did well.

175
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,390
Whether I did well or not...

176
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,550
I still don't know.

177
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,100
Do you think you would've had your vengeance if you killed the princess?

178
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,590
That would, in fact, rather...

179
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,290
ended up helping that man, Yi I Cheom, instead.

180
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,090
And with her death it would be as if none of this happened.

181
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,640
Because Yi I Cheom would be able to survive this.

182
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,850
The kindness of your heart

183
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,280
was able to help you after all.

184
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,160
But why do I feel so tormented?

185
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,860
Ever since I saw him, I haven't been able to do anything!

186
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,950
I haven't been able to drink water,

187
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,670
even breathing is difficult.

188
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,070
Buddha, have mercy.

189
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,370
If only you had not remembered him,

190
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,350
you wouldn't be in such anguish.

191
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,690
How could you remember that face from such a young age?

192
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,990
This may also be karma.

193
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,410
How could I forget his face?

194
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,790
My grandfather...

195
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,420
My father!

196
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,500
And my two uncles whom he glared at with such cold, unfeeling eyes.

197
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,840
His voice when he called my grandfather a rebel leader before ordering his beheading.

198
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,250
I swore to avenge them as long as I lived.

199
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,720
Is it fine for me to live as if none of that happened?

200
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,120
Then go.

201
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,470
Go and kill them all.

202
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,530
After you kill them all, you too, will be killed.

203
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,770
And if you die, Cha Dol will follow in your footsteps,

204
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,910
spending his days as a tramp,

205
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,690
wasting away on gambling and committing bossam.

206
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,090
Ba Wu...

207
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,040
They say that no flower lasts more than ten days.

208
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,090
And even a full moon will eventually wane.

209
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,510
Do you think their power will last forever?

210
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,350
If you wait long enough...

211
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,780
good days will come to you.

212
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,630
How much of that did you hear?

213
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,880
Or rather... when did you start eavesdropping?

214
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,210
I guess you heard all of that from the beginning...

215
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,670
What part of that was the beginning?

216
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,040
Man...

217
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,480
I wondered why you always gave off a nobleman's aura so easily.

218
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,810
So what do you plan on doing now?

219
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,940
It seemed like you lost your mind after seeing your enemy's face.

220
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,070
Why did you come here?

221
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,540
Are you going to exact vengeance?

222
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,900
Vengeance...

223
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,780
That's what you said. In front of the monk.

224
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,650
You swore it upon your grandfather's corpse.

225
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,840
I did.

226
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah, well...

227
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,970
The living people are what's important. What's the use of avenging the dead?

228
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,280
Do you wish to die a dog's death?

229
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,730
Plus you have to think about Cha Dol, as well as your mother, and little sister in Cheonan.

230
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,100
I thought you were a mere runaway slave.

231
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,430
Runaway slave?

232
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,460
I mean, your mother and sister were Gwanbi.
   (female slaves in charge of lodging and food for  village heads)

233
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,570
If you weren't a slave, isn't the only other thing obvious? A runaway slave.

234
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,490
A runaway slave...

235
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,080
If a rebel's descendant like me wanted to preserve his life,

236
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,310
I had to do everything to conceal my identity.

237
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,710
I had no other choice but to hide from you, too.

238
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,330
Yeah, well a scoundrel like me

239
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,320
would never understand the world of nobles.

240
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,640
But I think I understand what you're saying.

241
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,280
Thank you. For understanding me.

242
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh right. But about that princess.

243
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,090
Did you really have to abandon her like that?

244
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,370
I mean, Cha Dol told me you jumped through all kinds of hoops for her.

245
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,490
But why are you now—?

246
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,520
Wait,

247
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,000
are the princess and your enemy ... related somehow?

248
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,170
He's her father-in-law.

249
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,110
Her what-in-law?

250
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,080
The princess is that bastard's daughter-in-law.

251
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,230
Dear me...

252
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,480
Excuse me, Your Highness.

253
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,400
When the young master arrives, you should return to the palace.

254
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,730
If you would only meet his majesty or Royal Consort Yun—

255
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,060
You and I would be safe, I'd assume.

256
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,000
But once my royal father knows the truth,

257
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,710
it's obvious my in-law's family will be smashed to pieces.

258
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,280
Do you think my brother-in-law would be safe then?

259
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,380
And what about his aunt and the rest of the family?

260
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,210
I understand what you're saying, but no matter how I think,

261
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,940
his majesty must first know that you're alive—

262
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,020
He already knows.

263
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,770
I'm sorry?

264
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,490
What, he saw his daughter and pretended to not notice?

265
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,370
The king?

266
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,070
What a heartless man.

267
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,520
It's clear now that noble blood ties are different.

268
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,030
Fellows like us couldn't be kings even if we were ordered to.

269
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,700
Wait a second. But this changes the whole story!

270
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,680
What did you call that? Myeon Sa?

271
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
- Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon. 
 - Yeah, that!

272
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,820
Even if the young master took that to make a deal with the king,

273
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,230
there's no guarantee the princess will be safe, right?

274
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,050
I mean, do you think a king who abandoned his own daughter would now come to protect her?

275
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,030
Is the king coming to take away her highness?

276
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,380
- You surprised me! 
 - You little—!

277
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Then we should've come with her!  Why did you leave her highness at home?

278
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,860
If anything happens to her, this is all your fault!

279
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,220
He's right. You were rash there.

280
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,730
The young master is trying to make a deal with a king who already abandoned his daughter,

281
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,660
weren't you suspicious?

282
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,890
Were you that naive?

283
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,680
After you saw that enemy—

284
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,750
After you saw that Yi I Cheom, you lost your mind,

285
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,730
so you couldn't think straight at all, could you?

286
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,780
Let's hurry and go, Father!

287
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,800
Before the king comes to capture her highness, let's hurry and go home.

288
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,330
Please? Father!

289
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,690
What,

290
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,130
What? Don't you care whether or not she's captured because she's that man's daughter-in-law?

291
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,780
Don't do something you'll regret.

292
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,750
Take care of Cha Dol for a little while.

293
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,880
Are you going to bring her by yourself?

294
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
Why would I go there?

295
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,590
Let them take care of their own business.

296
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,900
Father!

297
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,510
- Hey Ba Wu... 
 - Hey!

298
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,830
Won't both of you come to your senses?

299
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,430
Whether they squabble with each other or not, our lives are more important.

300
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,640
Who should be worrying about who right now?

301
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,820
Father...

302
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,890
I'm visiting Cheonan.

303
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm going to see your grandma. So, until I get back, listen to Mr. Chun Bae.

304
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,670
- Understand? 
 - Yes.

305
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,350
But her highness—

306
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,080
This place is dangerous, so I'll see you in the house at Hanyang.

307
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,000
Do you think... Hanyang will be safe?

308
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,850
It should be fine for a brief moment.

309
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,610
You're right. They ransacked the place once, they wouldn't do it again, would they?

310
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,920
Why isn't he coming?

311
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,240
If the young master would come, then her highness would be able to calm her mind.

312
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,940
What happened to my bag?

313
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,880
I put it neatly next to mine.

314
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,650
Bring it to me. I must be off at once.

315
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,310
Your Highness. If you would wait just a little longer, the young master will—

316
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,820
I mean to leave before he arrives.

317
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,510
Your Highness...

318
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,730
Would there be a better solution if I see Brother-in-law?

319
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,760
After hearing you talk about going to the palace,

320
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,450
I only became more determined to leave here at once.

321
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,930
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

322
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,330
If he sees me again,

323
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,230
from that moment on, he too will be a man on the run for the rest of his life.

324
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,120
Because of me. All so that I can live.

325
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,830
I cannot make him a fugitive too, can I?

326
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,900
But still, he will soon be here,

327
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,990
so even if you leave, you should at least see his face before leaving.

328
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,280
He put his life on the line to do all of this.

329
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,850
- If you leave like this— 
 - If I see his face...

330
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,980
Do you think he'll just let me leave?

331
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,570
If you will not come with me, I will leave by myself.

332
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,880
I understand, Your Highness!

333
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,940
I will follow you.

334
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,050
I will escort you, so please wait for a moment.

335
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,340
- Grab her! 
 - Who are you, ruffians?

336
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,330
Stay still.

337
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,160
Who are you, bastards?

338
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,550
Let go. I said let go!

339
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,160
- Let go! 
 - Where do you think you're going?

340
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,650
Grab her! Stop right there!

341
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,160
Your Highness, please escape!

342
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,030
Stop right there!

343
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,760
If you touch even a hair on her head,

344
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,530
I will not move one step from this place.

345
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,740
They're gone.

346
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,780
Search harder.

347
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,890
Faster. Move faster, huh?

348
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,360
I'm already so short of time, I could die.

349
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,710
- Will you move faster! 
 -Your Highness!

350
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,280
Your Highness! Your—!

351
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,660
Get up, already!

352
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,950
Quit squirming on the ground.

353
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,940
Are you all right?

354
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,760
Why do you keep dawdling?

355
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,780
Step aside! Do you think you will be safe after all this?

356
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,610
I said step aside this instant!

357
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,420
This little b*tch has lost her mind!

358
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,870
Are you all right?

359
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,590
Your Highness, I am fine. I am fine— Ah!

360
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,230
Did you hurt your ankle?

361
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,400
I am fine. Don't worry! I am fine.

362
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,930
Hey.

363
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,420
What are you staring at. Huh?!

364
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,750
- How dare you! 
 - You little—!

365
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,650
You scum! What are you doing?

366
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,550
Did you not just see that she tried to get up, but was unable to?

367
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,820
Hyeong-nim, it's not too late to handle this the quick and easy way!

368
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,620
I'm saying this again, but if you touch even a hair on her head,

369
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,820
I will not move a single step from this place.

370
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,410
If she is harmed, you may kill me,

371
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,380
but you won't take me alive!

372
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,730
Let's just take her.

373
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,910
If you don't want to see that wench die,

374
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,000
you better start being submissive before I change my mind. Got it?!

375
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,570
Let's go!

376
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,060
Get up already!

377
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,710
Get up!

378
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,190
Where have you gone?

379
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,570
Whoa.

380
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,920
- Let me ask you something. 
 - Yes.

381
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,220
It looks like you all are peddlers. Do you know this area well?

382
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,130
We even know all the side roads, so ask whatever you want.

383
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,980
Then are there any other paths that lead to Hanyang from Wollong Mountains?

384
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,170
If it's from Wollong Mountains ... Besides this path...

385
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,740
Going to Sae Mal and taking the riverboat should be the fastest way, right?

386
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,360
Which jetty are you talking about?

387
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,110
Hurry on!

388
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,070
Your Highness...

389
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,940
Aren't you getting on?

390
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,640
Hyeong-nim.

391
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,570
Hurry and get up!

392
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,930
- Get up! 
 - Oh get up already!

393
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,740
Keep moving! What are you looking at?

394
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,030
What happened?

395
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,470
We captured the women as you requested,

396
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,170
at the latest they should arrive by tonight.

397
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,190
Good work. Go and slake your thirst and get some rest.

398
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes, my lord.

399
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,980
I finally get to see blessings fall upon me!

400
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,680
Get your fruit here!

401
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,710
Get your fruit here!

402
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,610
Kim Dae Seok!

403
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,110
Hey, move!

404
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,990
Where have you hidden my sister-in-law?

405
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,250
I told you to let go!

406
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,810
Kim Dae Seok!

407
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,890
This is driving me nuts!

408
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,610
- I lost them because of you! 
 - You will tell me right now where my sister-in-law is.

409
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,380
How do you know my father?

410
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Was someone in your family one of the lives that my father took?

411
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,320
Was it because my father was your enemy, that you bossam'ed my sister-in-law?

412
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,160
- Let's talk after putting away your sword— 
 - If he's not your enemy...

413
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,680
Why did you do this to my family?

414
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,180
I thought I told you.

415
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,900
When I open my mouth, either you or I must die.

416
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,800
Do you want to put an end to this right now?

417
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,080
Hurry up and keep moving.

418
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,220
Really, you annoying little—!

419
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,930
No, Your Highness. I—

420
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,890
I'm fine.

421
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,320
Please be careful.

422
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,590
Just a little more.

423
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,600
Will you not hurry?!

424
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Look here. Can you not loosen this rope at least until we've passed this hill?

425
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Can't we move faster if you at least let me carry her on my back, or help support her weight?

426
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,960
Unbind them.

427
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,980
- Hyeong-nim! 
 - Or would you rather carry them on your back?

428
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,590
- I got it. 
 - If they look like they're trying to run away...

429
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,610
kill the older woman first.

430
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,570
Are you very hurt?

431
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,080
N-not at all! This much is nothing.

432
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,620
It will be all better after a night's rest.

433
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,980
I'm sorry. Because of me, you're needlessly—

434
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,140
Why do you say such things?

435
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,220
And why is this your fault?

436
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,740
It's all because of that blasted fool deserving of death.

437
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,810
Stop talking about him, and give me your leg.

438
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,470
Why do you want my...?

439
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,490
I need to loosen your legs before we can continue, right?

440
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,010
- Oh, that won't be necessary. 
 - I say!

441
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,310
Oh, but—!

442
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,540
If that ruffian comes to rescue us,

443
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,470
if I am to carry you and run, I suppose I will need my leg strength?

444
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:54,170
Don't wait for him. He won't come for us.

445
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,360
That's not true. For certain, he...

446
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,740
he followed us all the way to the tavern streets. I saw him.

447
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,450
I told him to not come.

448
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,870
I'm sorry?

449
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,850
What can he do by himself against these barbarians?

450
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,480
I can't make Cha Dol fatherless for my sake, can I?

451
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,160
Why, of all times, did you have to show up at that moment!

452
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,120
If you had only protected sister-in-law...

453
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,320
Did you think I knew this would happen?

454
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,900
Didn't I clearly tell you?

455
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,290
You were to keep watch over her until I return. But you left home.

456
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,050
I didn't expect your father to release slave hunters as well.

457
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,880
They're not men my father sent.

458
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,930
How do you know that?

459
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,690
While going to your home, I came across the mercenaries who were looking for her.

460
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,640
Then who took her?

461
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,890
For now, I'm going to Paju to see what those men were up to.

462
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,260
If you find anything, let's meet again in that bier hut from earlier.

463
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,360
Serve it again later.

464
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,250
- But this is a prescription from the Royal Physician— 
 - It's an order from the king!

465
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,620
- What about Hwa In? 
 - She will arrive at Doseong before nightfall.

466
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,080
I will bring her to the palace as soon as she arrives.

467
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,670
No. The grave must be moved first.

468
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,900
After it's been revealed that her coffin is empty,

469
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,970
then Hwa In must return alive.

470
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,650
If so...

471
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,560
As soon as Hwa In arrives, move her to your home and report back to me.

472
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,570
After that, I'll let you know what should be done.

473
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,650
Yes, Your Majesty. I will follow your order with unerring precision.

474
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,050
You must never forget that the Left State Councillor is always spying on your back.

475
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:12,570
You must be perfect in evading his eyes and ears. Heed my advice.

476
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Is it because you have the king's adoring favor?

478
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,430
Your neck seems too stiff to bow to me.

479
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,810
I was lost in thought and forgot my manners, Your Excellence.

480
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,620
Were you on your way from an audience with the King?

481
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,490
Weren't you already aware?

482
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:14,600
It's not just your neck, but your tongue has gotten stiff too.

483
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,580
Seeing you suddenly brings these words to my mind...

484
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,080
"Kǒu shì huò zhī mén shé shì zhǎn shēn dāo.  (in Chinese)

485
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,440
Bìkǒu shēn cáng shé. Ānshēn chǔ chù láo...

486
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,310
"The mouth is the door to disaster"

487
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,760
"The tongue is the blade that cuts your own body."

488
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,730
"If one closes his mouth and hides his tongue, wherever he goes, he will be at peace."

489
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,670
The dethroned Prince Yeonsan made his subjects wear this saying on their neck to prevent them from  speaking frankly.

490
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,550
Was this not from the "Shineon" tags on their necks?

491
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,820
You know it well.

492
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,610
That is the advice I want to give you.

493
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:03,890
Hold it deeply in your heart.

494
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,950
We will wait and see

495
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,630
who will wear that "Shineon" tag on his neck.

496
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,490
Why did you order that the grave be moved first?

497
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:36,800
If Princess Hwa In appears, is there any reason to move the grave any longer?

498
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,150
You underestimate Yi I Cheom.

499
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,460
Eighty percent of the government officials belong to the great northern faction, which is his arms and legs.

500
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,550
If his son brings up the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon, and the ministers take his side,

501
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,120
I have no choice but to pardon Yi I Cheom.

502
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,460
I'm moving the grave as a trap for Yi I Cheom.

503
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,160
If we do that first, and it's been revealed that Hwa In's corpse is not there,

504
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,510
That man, Yi I Cheom will likely do everything in his power to deceive me again.

505
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,770
But if Hwa In enters at that moment,

506
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,960
even the Great Northern Factions will not be able to support him any further.

507
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,920
That is quite an ingenious plan, Your Majesty!

508
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,230
All things will go according to your will.

509
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,650
Pour me another glass.

510
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,350
Your Majesty, there is one thing I'm curious about.

511
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,420
Speak.

512
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,740
While it may be unlikely,

513
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,930
if Yi I Cheom's youngest son brings Hwa In,

514
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,910
what do you plan on doing with Yi I Cheom then?

515
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:04,350
Do you know which monarch granted the most pardons with the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon?

516
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,400
It was the Chinese emperor Zhu Yuanzhang.

517
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,870
He must've granted it to his retainers at the founding of his dynasty.

518
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,790
That is correct.

519
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,740
They helped him establish the Ming Dynasty and the country of Ming.

520
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,030
He gave it to those who helped him ascend  the throne.

521
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,510
In my case, Yi I Cheom, who helped me ascend my throne,  is like those people.

522
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,200
But what happened to them?

523
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,910
Li Shanchang, Lan Yu, and the rest.

524
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:34,850
Most of those who were second only to the emperor in wielding power died

525
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:40,250
Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon had only one exception to avoid punishment, right? The crime of treason!

526
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,510
Do you truly believe they all plotted treason?

527
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,270
Like you mentioned a few days ago...

528
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:53,130
The calf that is larger than the thigh is useless.

529
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,740
Yi I Cheom has grown too great.

530
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,740
Your Majesty...

531
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,450
I heard it said that a wounded beast is more dangerous.

532
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:11,750
If Yi I Cheom decides to do something wicked ...

533
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,980
That is why I instructed Kim Ja Jeom to gather the Western Faction.

534
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,720
However, most of the useful Westerners are out of the reach of the capital.

535
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,590
The remaining ones are of the lowest rank in the government, so they wield no power.

536
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:33,770
Worry not. In the case of a last resort, I have called someone who can subdue Yi I Cheom.

537
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,920
We located where her ladyship was residing,

538
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,030
but we only found the remnants of a hasty escape.

539
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,190
It seems she left with Dae Yeop.

540
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,330
What shall we do now?

541
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,350
If she is with Dae Yeop, at least we can be relieved that she is not in someone else's hands.

542
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,250
We must first address the more urgent matter of the moving of the grave.

543
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,250
What happened to the investigation of Court Lady Kim that I requested a few days ago?

544
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,630
She has been selling government position certificates without the knowledge of the royal treasury.

545
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,260
She schemed with the king's brother-in-law, Yoo Hee Boon, who is the palace architect.

546
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,750
Pooling work responsibilities, diverting labor costs, embezzlement of material funds, among others.

547
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,270
You couldn't find such corruption elsewhere!

548
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,230
Since the construction work is great, it's natural that it has many unnoticed holes.

549
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:50,370
I am also aware that these tribute collectors have their own way.

550
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,970
Based on the gossip of the wealth a tribute collector can get,

551
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,550
there are rumors that people are offering Court Lady Kim bribes to attain these positions.

552
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,180
Rumors will not suffice. There must be evidence.

553
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,590
Even if I have to torture it out of them, I will make sure to find it for you, Father.

554
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,120
What about Kim Ja Jeom?

555
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,400
Perhaps it's because the astrology division is not a particularly profitable one,

556
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,480
there wasn't much dirt I could find on him.

557
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,890
Even so, find something.

558
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,320
If there's nothing on him, search everything that surrounds him.

559
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,750
There is no man that carries no dirt.

560
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,070
I will scold the officers to investigate his immediate family, his in-laws, his cousins, up to his in-laws' third cousins.

561
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,400
I will find dirt on one of them!

562
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,080
Your Highness.

563
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,020
Hurry up!

564
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,890
Y-your Highness.

565
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,600
Y-your Highness.

566
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,860
Look here!

567
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,270
Look here!

568
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,620
Please open the door!

569
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,440
Look here!

570
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,470
Nanny...

571
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,190
Your Highness.

572
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,830
We are going to safely get out of here.

573
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,830
If they want to take me alive, they will have to release you first.

574
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,600
- Your Highness. 
 - Did you not notice?

575
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,890
The men my father-in-law sent tried to kill me on sight.

576
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,020
Those men kept me alive all the way here.

577
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:12,530
Although I don't know who they are, this is evidence that they need me alive.

578
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:17,950
Father! You're home already!

579
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,060
What... didn't you go to Cheonan?

580
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,960
I'll explain that later. But first, what do I need to do to find slave hunters?

581
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,920
Why do you suddenly need slave hunters?

582
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,880
I'll explain later. Answer me first!

583
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,220
If you ask Hyeong-nim Du Chil, you'll know.

584
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,020
Du Chil?

585
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,090
Bottoms up!

586
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,030
I thought I was going to die.

587
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,350
Get us ten more bottles. Ten bottles!

588
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,720
Three won't be enough!

589
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,170
Eat up. Eat up.

590
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,010
Hey, Hyeong-nim.

591
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,580
I've been through so much.

592
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,030
Me?

593
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,390
Are you sure? No mistake?

594
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,350
If you're not going to believe me, why did you come looking for me?

595
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,320
I asked if you were sure, stop changing the subject!

596
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,930
So this Man Gang is one of the best slave hunters,

597
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,590
and his gang nabbed a big one?

598
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:15,600
Right. If they hadn't, would they have the means to pay for a gisaeng house such as this?

599
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,810
You're right.

600
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,390
But how did you know the orders came from an astrologer?

601
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,490
They wouldn't have leaked that info with their own lips.

602
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,410
After hearing about it from Hyang Dan, I personally met with one of that gang's youngest,

603
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,230
bribed him, and struggled with great difficulty to get that intel.

604
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,450
Happy now?

605
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,370
If any part of that was a lie, you know what happens, right?

606
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:38,020
I know well your filthy temper. Why would I lie to you?

607
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,350
Thanks. I will make sure to repay you for this debt.

608
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:45,960
What's with this "debt" nonsense? Just buy me a drink later,  boy.

609
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,610
Are you certain of this?

610
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,550
Of course, I'm certain. That man doesn't have reason to lie to us.

611
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,520
You can trust him.

612
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:03,110
Wait, you won't believe me, but you'll trust him?

613
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,610
That astrologer's name... was it Kim Ja Jeom by chance?

614
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,560
I don't know that far.

615
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,210
How can poor people like us know the names of nobility like him?

616
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,850
But who's Kim Ja Jeom, anyway?

617
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,850
Just as you ordered, I have brought the princess to my home.

618
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,630
I assume you made sure to avoid anyone's gaze?

619
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,040
We moved in secret. So please do not worry.

621
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,550
You must never underestimate Yi I Cheom.

622
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:36,580
If he catches wind of this, all of this would be for naught. Don't forget that.

623
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,120
Yes, Your Majesty. I will heed your advice closely.

624
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,460
Even the flying birds must not see her, understand?

625
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

626
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,460
Until your orders fall, not a soul will even see her highness's shadow.

627
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,550
Go and wait for my orders.

628
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:03,120
Jung Yeong, from this moment on, I must know every movement the Left State Councillor makes.

630
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

631
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:11,930
So that Kim Ja Jeom fellow hired the slave hunters

632
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,870
to capture the princess. There must be a reason, right?

633
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:18,350
How many times do I have to tell you? The king must've given the order.

634
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:23,330
This naive young master has been pleasantly fooled by the king.

635
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,150
What? Is there a rule saying that kings can't betray you?

636
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:34,360
The question is ... why he has come back to capture the princess.

637
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,060
One mistake and everyone will know that the princess is alive.

638
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:44,600
What convinced him to do a risky thing like working with slave hunters?

639
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,720
It's because of my father.

640
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,200
He wants to have my sister-in-law in his pocket before my father does.

641
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,020
That way he has justification to strike down my father.

642
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,160
So, just to win their power struggles, he's putting his daughter back in harm's way again?

643
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,720
If I match what I know as true with what these men have told you, then this is highly likely.

644
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,290
Wow, these people are just full of crap.

645
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:10,420
But if that's not the case, your suspicions may be wrong.

646
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:18,690
In truth, the king intends to assign him as the person in charge of moving Sister-in-law's grave.

647
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,380
Move her grave? They're going to dig up an empty coffin and move it?

648
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,880
The scale of rich people is really great.

649
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,830
They make a living person dead, hold a fake funeral with a fake grave?

650
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:32,050
I wonder what King Yeomra* is waiting for, instead of capturing them all now. 
  (the Buddhist king of hell)

651
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,310
Is he busy these days?

652
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,660
Let's go to that man's home first.

653
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,360
Hey!

654
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,760
That crazy fool!

655
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,390
Nanny.

656
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,160
That accursed fool. It'd be perfect if he could rescue us now.

657
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,880
Why did he even follow us onto that boat?

658
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,220
If he was going to come, don't you think he'd be here by now?

659
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,310
Your Highness, aren't you even resentful of him?

660
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,750
I'm sure he has his reasons—

661
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,800
Your Highness! He's the ruffian that took you in bossam and brought you to this!

662
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,310
How could you speak up for such a man?

663
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:13,350
I... I just want to kill him, I hate him so much.

664
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:20,500
When I think of the day of the bossam, my whole body trembles even now.

665
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,680
I think I could never forgive him.

666
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,450
There were many times I hated and resented him so much I could die.

667
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,980
But... I also discovered

668
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,090
living can be fun.

669
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,950
Mr. Chun Bae, why are you here?

670
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:58,130
I'm here because of you, you  runt!

671
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:02,100
I'm also going to head out at dawn.

672
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,190
You're going to rescue her highness, right?

673
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,930
Eat a lot and have strength!

674
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,830
There's no doubt, they're held in that house.

675
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,580
I will take care of the rest from here.

676
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,210
What?

677
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,450
What if things go wrong by trusting in you?

678
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,950
She's my sister-in-law.

679
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,480
Whatever I do is none of your business.

680
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,550
When you stole the Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon and I rescued Chun Bae, our deal was complete.

681
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,660
Since our deal is complete—

682
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,090
The deal with you was complete.

683
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,050
I no longer want to have anything to do with you.

684
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,220
But the princess...

685
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,230
This is my final warning.

686
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:08,600
Whether it's "princess" or "that person", never again utter her name by your lips.

687
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,960
She is not someone you could ever dare to desire.

688
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:20,560
- "Desire"? 
 - Until now, I tolerated every bit of your foul behavior for her sake.

689
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,420
But I will tolerate it no longer.

690
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:31,160
That's good. I too was getting tired of your arrogant reckless attitude.

691
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,540
Let's stop caring about each other, and figure out our plans separately.

692
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,700
Princess Hwa In...

693
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,950
was someone I was supposed to marry.

694
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,500
Although as a result of the king's orders,

695
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,440
overnight she became my sister-in-law instead of my bride.

696
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,050
The only woman in this world I've ever loved and cared for, now as well as back then,

697
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,090
is her, her alone.

698
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,800
Everything quiet so far?

699
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,830
Here, eat this.

700
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,370
Eat it!

701
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,370
The youngest master has arrived!

702
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,720
The youngest master has arrived!

703
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,280
Father, it is your son Dae Yeop.

704
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,470
Is there nobody outside?!

705
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:45,930

706
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:52,140
 The only woman in this world I've ever loved and cared for, now as well as back then,

707
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,450
 is her, her alone.

708
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,090
 I discovered...

709
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,350
 that living can be fun for me too.

710
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,260
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

711
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,360
 I understand now. Why I was dragged here.

712
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,970
 - You want to make a deal with me?

713
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,200
 Why are you doing all of this for a woman?

714
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,890
 Do you really plan on killing this child?

715
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,680
 I found out where Sister-in-law is...

716
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,820
 We must go now to retrieve the princess!

717
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:22,780
 Others may mistake this for a revolt. Can you handle the consequences of this?

718
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,560
 If something were to go awry, this nation of Joseon will be swept up in chaos.

719
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,050
 And a bloody wind might settle over the nation.

720
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,120
 Die. It's a royal decree.

721
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,920
 All of this happened because of me.

722
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,990
 So I think I'm going to have to end things.

723
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:38,420
 Your Highness! Your Royal Highness!

724
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:43,090
 She said this was the only way to help everyone.

725
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:46,420
♫  The stone rolls on  ♫
