00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,600
 Jeong Il Woo

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,750
 Kwon Yoo Ri

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,280
 Shin Hyeon Soo

4
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,160
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

5
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,920

6
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,380
Brother-in-law!

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,160
My eyes were beginning to get blisters trying to spot you.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,260
You mustn't, brother-in-law!

9
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,090
Have you lost your mind? Do you have a death wish?

10
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,430
Insolent fool! How dare you speak so casually to the princess?

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,900
Brother-in-law, could you first please sheathe your sword?

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,300
♫ There are still words that have been left unsaid ♫

13
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,150
You better go ahead with Cha Dol now.

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,870
Sister-in-law!

15
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,640
Brother-in-law, could you first hear what I have to say?

16
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,510
Please speak.

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,250
After I left Hanyang,

18
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,110
I intended to kill myself.

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,690
I owe a life's debt to this man.

20
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,110
He's the one who rescued me.

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,300
However, wasn't it because of this man that you are in this mess right now?

22
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,930
If it weren't for him, there would have been no reason for you to attempt suicide.

23
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,080
No, it's not merely because of him.

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,240
Even if this hadn't happened, it's likely that I...

25
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,930
Well, you are also well-aware, aren't you?

26
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,790
For my sake, please pretend you didn't see him.

27
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,640
I beseech you to do so.

28
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,040
♫ The petal of new spring brought by the clouds ♫

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,820
Cha Dol, hurry and take your father now.

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,240
What do you plan on doing?

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,730
Let's move to somewhere else.

32
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,610
I asked what you were planning on doing?

33
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,550
♫ The boat sails as if dancing ♫

34
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,440
♫ Suddenly my heart also flows ♫

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,810
Father...

36
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,030
♫ And that is how it scatters ♫

37
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,970
She told us to leave.

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,890
So let's go.

39
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,020
Father...

40
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,820
Your face has gotten very haggard.

41
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,400
How is your health?

42
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,190
Brother-in-law.

43
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, Sister-in-law.

44
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,470
The person you once knew as me...

45
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,070
no longer exists in this world.

46
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,780
Whatever you say, I plan to escort you back home.

47
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,560
I cannot return home without you. Nay... I will not.

48
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,340
If you would hide in Sangwon Temple for a little—

49
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,050
How many times must I tell you?

50
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,970
I am already a dead person.

51
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,660
You may be dead to Father and to the rest of the world

52
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,000
but you aren't to me.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,950
To me, you are always ... someone precious

54
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,220
like no other in this world.

55
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,750
So, couldn't you come with me, for my sake?

56
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,220
Not for your sake, but mine—

57
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,940
This is for your sake.

58
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,710
I am unable to return because of you.

59
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,840
Do you remember the first day we met?

60
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,570
Even now that day is still...

61
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,760
fresh in my memory.

62
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,700
 - Let's go. 
 - Yes.

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,340
♫  The whispering sound following the path  ♫

64
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,320
 This is your play friend, Crown Prince.

65
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,810
 Your Highness, I give you my greetings.

66
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,460
 This is boring.

67
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,700
♫  flows like the singing stream  ♫

68
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,350
 What is your name?

69
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,820
 I'm Dae Yeop from the Yi family of Gwangju Province, Your Highness.

70
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,060
 Good. From now on, you are my play friend. Understand?

71
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,010
 Y-yes.

72
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,750
 My name is Su Gyeong. Don't forget it!

73
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,390
 Lower your gaze.

74
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,530
 Leave him be. He's my friend, remember?

75
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,810
 My older brother has left, so let's put aside these toys and shoot with real bows and arrows.

76
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,410
 You do know how to shoot a bow, right?

77
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,750
 Your Highness, you mustn't do this. Your Highness? Your—

78
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,160
 You've hit the bullseye!

79
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,460
 - Did you see? This is how you do it. 
 - Yes.

80
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,670
 - Think you can do it? 
 - Yes.

81
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,250
 - How can you let this happen every time? 
 - Please forgive me.

82
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,530
 - Here, try! 
 - I will take her... her highness quickly back inside.

83
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,970
 Please quickly put an end to this.

84
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,610
 Yes.

85
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,750
 Make sure to straighten your back.

86
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,550
 Lower your arms a little.

87
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,620
 Pull your wrist to your lips.

88
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,600
 Hold your breath. Like this!

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,330
 Fire!

90
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,250
 It's a bullseye!

91
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,270
 It was worth teaching you like this!

92
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,300
 - Will you go over there with me? 
 - Yes.

93
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,650
 - Let's go! 
 - What are you all doing? Hurry and move!

94
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,260
 Your Highness, please don't run.

95
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,970
 Your highness will trip!

96
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,960
 It's so far away... Can you do it?

97
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,550
 Yes.

98
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,750
 - Try it. 
 - Yes.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,980
 Straighten your back...

100
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,410
 Isn't it hard?

101
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,010
 It's not hard at all.

102
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,300
 Don't worry about me and take your time drawing me, Your Highness.

103
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,380
 This is punishment for deceiving me. But seeing how you're fine,

104
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,690
 I think I'll have to start over from the beginning.

105
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,150
 P-punishment?

106
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,160
 As long as I'm spending time with you, this isn't a punishment, but a reward.

107
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,100
 Why are you sweet-talking me?

108
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,650
 According to the sages, I should treat sweet-talkers as wicked people and should stay away from them.

109
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,220
 I guess I should stay far from you.

110
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,750
 But Y-Your Highness...

111
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,110
 Come here.

112
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,730
 Oh, yes.

113
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,670
 What, do you not like it?

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,680
 It's not that...

115
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,070
 I think you've put too much effort in drawing your own face.

116
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,120
 I know you want to look beautiful, but I think this is a little too much. Your Highness.

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,820
 What did you say? Are you done talking?

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,660
 Please understand.

119
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,710
 You really are just toying with my emotions.

120
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,610
 You wicked Yi Dae Yeop, who indulges in sweet-talking... take my brush!

121
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,730
 Wait, Your Highness!

122
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,930
 How dare you!

123
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,460
 You stay still.

124
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,900
 Why are you looking at me like that?

125
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,170
 But you told me to stay still...

126
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,230
 Y-your Highness...

127
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,080
 You're impudent.

128
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,670
Brother-in-law,

129
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,570
As for me,

130
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,440
I'd like to remember you as the man who thrilled my heart as a girl,

131
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,650
for many years to come.

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,810
Your image as a man who is struggling and has become pitiable for my sake

133
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,610
is something I wish to erase from my memory.

134
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,680
So please help me.

135
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,100
Please forgive me, Sister-in-law.

136
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,880
I cannot listen to your request.

137
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,540
Brother-in-law.

138
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,560
You're alive like this.

139
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,370
You're standing before me now, just as you were back then.

140
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,300
How could I see you as a dead person?

141
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,820
Did you want to remember me as the day we first met?

142
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,280
Did you want me to let you treasure those memories as they were? No.

143
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,680
I don't want that. I cannot do that.

144
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,170
Brother-in-law...

145
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,660
If you insist on living as a dead person...

146
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,690
I also must live as a dead man. So please...

147
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,080
Don't say this is for my sake.

148
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,250
If you really are doing this for my sake, please follow my wishes.

149
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,960
You know very well I cannot do that!

150
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,690
No, I do not know that.

151
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,210
If the gaze of the world scares me, then I can hide.

152
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,130
If Father's blade frightens me,

153
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,460
I merely need to expect to be killed by that blade with you. That is all.

154
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,410
If you continue to do this, what am I supposed to do?

155
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,640
Why do you continue to herd me toward a steeper and more dangerous cliff?

156
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm saying that next to your lonely spot at that cliff...

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I will stand alongside you.

158
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,650
Where did that kid go?

159
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,810
Father!

160
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,830
Where were you just now?

161
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,050
I had something to ask the man with the sword.

162
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you have a death wish?

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,730
Do you have any idea what kind of man that is?

164
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,020
I feel so bad for the princess!

165
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,170
Father, her highness is going to die.

166
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,560
He said she must go with him.

167
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,380
He said there are people worrying about her,

168
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,360
and waiting for her.

169
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,140
So why do you feel bad for her? And why is she going to die?

170
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,010
She's going with that man. Why would she die?

171
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,440
Returning to his home means she's going to die!

172
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,280
Going back to his home means she's going to die!

173
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,640
Who's going to die? You keep nagging about death at every little thing!

174
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Let's hurry and go!

175
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,900
Father... Father!

176
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,990
Damn it...

177
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,220
If you stay on this path, you'll reach home. I'll—

178
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,820
Are you going to rescue her highness?

179
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,390
- Yes. 
 - You have to make sure to rescue her!

180
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,930
You don't trust me, right?

181
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,490
No, that's not true. I trust you.

182
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,500
Then do as I say. I will get her highness and hurry back home too. All right?

183
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,250
Now go.

184
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,060
Father!

185
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,050
You have to return with her highness. You must!

186
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,540
I got it, you runt. Now go.

187
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,980
How can you be this frustrating?

188
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,830
Do you not realize what kind of wrath your recklessness will bring?

189
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,150
I do not care. If it brings death, I will be the one to die in your place,

190
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,150
and if that's impossible, I will die with you.

191
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,170
Brother-in-law!

192
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,870
What are you doing?!

193
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,450
- Brother-in-law! 
 - I am fine.

194
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,940
You bastard. It wasn't that long ago you'd fly to rescue your sister-in-law.

195
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,830
But now you're dragging her into the jaws of death?

196
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,440
In the end your family's name is more important than a person's life, is it?

197
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,080
You filthy bastard deserving of death!

198
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,000
What nonsense are you spouting?

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,460
This man plans to deliver you to his father.

200
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,000
- This is a misunderstanding. 
 - Don't be deceived.

201
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,670
Brother-in-law!

202
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,490
Sister-in-law!

203
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
I will hold them here so you go. Go save my sister-in-law!

204
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,300
The young master interfered again, making this a headache... so let's finish it quickly.

205
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,970
 Closely watch the Left State Councillor, and when he kills Princess Hwa In...

206
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,460
Who are you?

207
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,750
 Make sure to bring that evidence to me.

208
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,170
 I can't even kill those bastards.

209
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,920
 What am I supposed to do?

210
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,460
Stop there!

211
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,940
Grab her!

212
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,870
No... no! Hey, you bloody butchers!

213
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:17,650
 ♫ Please hear my words ♫

214
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,640
 ♫ Retrace your steps and come over here ♫

215
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:33,320
 ♫ Why do you lead a life of such struggle? ♫

216
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,670
Sister-in-law!

217
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,040
What happened? Sister-in-law!

218
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,270
Sister-in-law... are you all right?

219
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:11,960
 ♫ After wondering around from place to place, you'll eventually come back ♫

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,890
Please spare me! Spare me.

222

♫   But it's not only today that things don't go my way  ♫

223
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,460
♫  Like a rolling stone that rolls here and there on the ground  ♫

224
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,550
♫  Covered with wounds, I'm on the road again today  ♫

225

♫  I am an angular stone. ♫

♫   I do not stop.  ♫

227
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,230
♫  The stone keeps rolling  ♫

228
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,110
♫  Although I have many sharp angles  ♫

229
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,650
♫  The stone rolls on  ♫

230
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:37,470
♫  Where will I go tomorrow?  ♫

231
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,640
Are you all right?

232
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,890
Give that to me.

233
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,310
I wish for you to not experience such cruel things.

234
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,520
I don't think he's dead yet.

235
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,220
Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law!

236
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,870
- You! 
 - Father!

237
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,120
Are you all right? You aren't hurt?

238
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,610
Where do you think this is? I told you to go home!

239
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,960
What about the princess? Were you not able to save her?

240
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,180
Did that man take her away?

241
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,590
Do you think I'd let him take her away? Follow me.

242
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,520
Are you suggesting we leave him here?

243
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,960
Who said we're leaving him here? I'm saying I'll take him to a physician.

244
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,040
If that's not the same thing, what is it?

245
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,200
Then what? It's obvious as soon as he wakes up he'll be eager to kill me.

246
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,910
So what do you want me to do?

247
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,560
Father. You'd always tell me

248
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,720
men live and die by honor. Didn't you?

249
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,460
I'll save this man in your place.

250
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,340
Because I'm a man.

251
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,850
- Oh fine! Fine! Let's take him home with us. 
 - Thank you.

252
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,680
On one condition. As soon as he's breathing easy again, I've done my job.

253
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,880
Then let's part ways as we see fit.

254
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,250
You can't make excuses about him being sick just to keep him longer. Understand?

255
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,620
If things didn't turn out this way, I would've sent him away personally.

256
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,680
Then we have an agreement.

257
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,680
Father! It seems he's not even breathing anymore.

258
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,240
- Please get me some water. 
 - All right.

259
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,510
I'll get the fire going.

260
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,290
Look here. Come to your senses. Hey!

261
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,980
What about my sister-in-law?

262
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,000
She's safe.

263
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,300
Don't push yourself. You're lucky to be alive.

264
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,460
What about the others?

265
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,830
They're all dead, and I've erased their tracks.

266
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,690
There's nothing to worry about.

267
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,260
No one saw you there, I take it?

268
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,690
Hwa In is still alive, you say?

270
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,780
Have I overestimated that man, Yi I Cheom?

271
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,430
Did you say Yi I Cheom's youngest son was injured?

272
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,510
His youngest son...

274
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,080
 It's not your youngest son, but your second son that you want Hwa In to marry?

275
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,750
 Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,420
 Wasn't there a discussion about the marriage of your youngest and Hwa In?

277
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,020
 That's what I heard from Royal Noble Consort Yun.

278
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,980
 I am deeply ashamed to admit this, Your Majesty.

279
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,020
 But honestly my youngest son...

280
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,090
 suffers from impotence.

281
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,020
 Impotence?

282
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,920
 Oh, dear me.

283
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,610
The impotence story may be yet another lie.

284
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,970
Was there any reason for his youngest son to not marry Hwa In?

285
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,130
Find out every detail you can about Yi I Cheom's youngest son.

286
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,180
Why am I even doing this?

287
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,960
I give up. He can die for all I care.

288
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,190
- Today and tomorrow will be the hardest days. So watch over him closely. 
 - I understand.

289
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,510
As long as he overcomes these hardest days, he should be fine, right?

290
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,370
It's still a problem even if he survives with help from the gods.

291
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,520
I couldn't believe how many stab wounds he had. Did he just come back from war?

292
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,580
Didn't I give you money to not ask questions?

293
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,690
Did anyone ask for more money, you rascal?

294
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,400
It's because he seems to have lost a lot of blood.

295
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,280
He lost so much blood that his face looks paper-white.

296
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,530
Then what should we do?

297
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,950
What else? You have to feed him everything that's good for his health.

298
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,890
So what would be good for his health?

299
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,200
Wild ginseng. Or wild ginseng.

300
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,990
Especially things like wild ginseng.

301
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,790
Wild ginseng?!

302
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,660
Do you have any?

303
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,190
You two are so lucky.

304
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,460
I just so happened to have a ginseng herbalist get me some wild ginseng roots to sell.

305
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,650
How about it? Would you like to buy them from me?

306
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,490
Yes, please sell them to us.

307
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,120
But it's such a rare commodity.

308
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,790
Do you have that kind of money?

309
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,770
(What? I don't have the money.)

310
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,390
First, take this.

311
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,440
This won't cover a fraction of it!

312
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,550
I'll even get a loan to pay the rest of it. So don't worry.

313
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,420
I can't wait long. The rich old people can't get enough of these things—

314
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,530
Please don't worry and wait for us. I swear on the royal family's na—

315
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,660
I swear on my name.

316
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,830
I guess your wife is better off than she looks?

317
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,240
Well, a little.

318
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,200
How could you—

319
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,610
Your Majesty.

320
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,230
Your tea must be cold by now.

321
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,560
Should I prepare it again?

322
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,830
Gae Si.

323
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

324
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,900
I need a dependable person from the Western Faction.

325
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,270
Do you know of anyone?

326
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:10,090
Among those in my court, there is one girl who has ties to the Western Faction.

327
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,730
Through that girl I should be able to find someone.

328
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,890
Give me the details.

329
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,880
There is the daughter of Yi Gwi, head of the city of Pyeongsan.

330
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,860
She lost her husband at an early age and began working for the palace.

331
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,660
His social status is too high for this job. Isn't there anyone else?

332
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,970
That girl's late husband's brother is Kim Ja Jeom, 7th rank officer at the Astronomy, Astrology and Meteorology Bureau.

333
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,660
Kim Ja Jeom?

334
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,960
He is the grandson of Kim Eok Ryeong, the governor of the Gangwon Province.

335
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,970
Is he the one that you requested me to promote in rank some days ago?

336
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

337
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,060
He has ambition, wits and a way with words.

338
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,490
So I thought he'd someday be useful, which is why I asked for it.

339
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,360
I need to see this man. Right now.

340
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,630
There is a target I want to hit.

341
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,140
But as you can see, I have no arrows. What should I do?

342
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,560
Your Majesty. Please use me as your arrows.

343
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,330
I, Kim Ja Jeom, weak as I may be, will put all of my strength

344
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,540
to become the arrow that can hit whatever target you need!

345
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,870
It doesn't matter what the target is?

346
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,960
As long as you will it, even if it is the fires of hell, I will not mind, Your Majesty.

347
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,140
I  want to move Hwa In's grave. Can you do it?

348
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,240
I will do it at all costs, Your Majesty.

349
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,760
The Left State Councillor will do everything to stop you. Can you still do it?

350
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,590
Even if the emperor of Ming were to oppose me, I will make sure to accomplish your will.

351
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,820
Good. I will make good use of you.

352
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,730
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

353
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:38,340
A few days ago I saw Hwa In in a dream.

354
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,240
After that, I couldn't sleep because of discomfort.

355
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,400
I asked the astrologer to interpret my dream.

356
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,140
I was told it is intertwined with the location of Hwa In's tomb.

357
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,850
Astrologer Kim Ja Jeom, step forward and report on your investigation.

358
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

359
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,310
I inspected princess Hwa In's open tomb with the geomancer.* 
   (person in charge of locating royal tombs)

360
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:09,260
But to our dismay, it was found that her tomb is in the worst among wrong locations.

361
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,220
That is outrageous slander, Your Majesty.

362
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,910
How would I have placed Princess Hwa In's tomb in a wrong location?

363
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,390
She is buried next to my own son.

364
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,500
Please wait, Left Councillor.  Listen to what Kim Ja Jeon says first.

365
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,790
Please continue.

366
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

367
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,390
The geomancer said that, although at first glance the princess' tomb seems to be at a propitious site for the son of a noble family,

368
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:39,150
if you look closely, it is highly likely that vermin and roots have entered and filled it by piercing the flesh and cutting off the veins.

369
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,310
So are you saying the vermin and tree roots have damaged the corpse?

370
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,440
That is not the only thing the geomancer said.

372
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,710
If you continue to leave the princess' grave there,

373
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,800
both you and her highness the Noble Royal Consort Yun may suffer harm.

374
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,960
We need to act promptly.

375
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,820
What do you think, Left State Councillor?

376
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,940
I can't believe what Kim Ja Jeon himself said.

377
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,250
Since it is a matter involving Your  Majesty's safety,

378
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,730
will you permit me and other geomancers to do another inspection ourselves, Your Majesty?

379
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,660
There's no time for that, Your Majesty.

380
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,440
As the geomancer said, the harm to the living is so strong

381
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,760
that the evil energy has already invaded Your Majesty's sleep and you had a nightmare.

382
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,420
The princess' grave should be quickly moved to a good place to restore your energy.

383
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,480
Even if only for the sake of the court and the Jongmyo*, we need to move Hwa In's grave quickly. 
  (Shrine for royalty)

384
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,550
Please grant me permission to move it.

385
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,340
What do the lords think?

386
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,020
It's a matter of Your Majesty's safety.

387
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,550
It's a good idea to act quickly, Your Majesty.

388
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,820
It's an urgent matter.

389
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,960
Please grant the permission to move it, Your Majesty.

390
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,990
Please grant permission.

391
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,620
What do you think, Left State Councillor?

392
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,890
Please grant the permission, Your Majesty.

393
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,590
I hereby grant permission to move Hwa In's grave.

394
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,790
Although she left the palace in order to be wed.

395
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,360
She was still my child so I can't help but consider this a royal matter.

396
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,430
Astrologer Kim Ja Jeong, assist the Left State Councillor.

397
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,120
Let there be no neglect in the performance of this task.

398
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,540
I will bear that in mind, Your Majesty!

399
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,450
Was Kim Ja Jeom with his majesty in Gwandeokjeon Pavilion last night?

400
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,290
Yes, Your Excellency.

401
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,430
Did you hear anything else?

402
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,230
He had everyone move back.

403
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,770
I understand.

404
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,940
I'll reward you later.

405
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,430
Spare me.

406
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,680
Lord, I am to blame.

407
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,640
I'm sorry.

408
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,430
Lord.

409
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,240
When you said with your mouth they were at Gongju, what were you saying?

410
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,570
Didn't I say that if it turns out to be wrong, you'd rather wish to be dead?

411
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,440
I must have been confused because I heard it a long time ago, Lord.

412
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,080
You were confused because it was a long time ago, you say?

413
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,440
Then, I just need to help you remember.

414
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,370
Torture this ruffian.

415
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,690
Yes, Sir.

416
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,320
Spare me. Spare me.

417
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,610
Spare me.

418
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,420
I haven't even started yet.

419
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,090
Paju!  It's Paju.

420
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,210
My Lord. Someone claims to have seen her ladyship, so I sent my men to Paju.

421
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,010
Have you received any news?

422
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,610
I haven't heard anything yet.

423
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,660
Torture this ruffian until he tells everything.

424
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,010
Yes, My Lord.

425
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,360
I remembered. I remembered.

426
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,790
I clearly heard that, when he was young, he was a pilgrim's servant

427
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,420
at the Mount Wallong Temple in Paju.

428
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,150
If it's a lie this time, I'll pull out your tongue.

429
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,080
Not just my tongue. I bet my life, Lord!

430
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,390
I almost died.

431
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,760
By the way, Ba Wu hasn't been caught, has he?

432
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,820
Whatever, whatever.

433
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,940
Ba Wu. I've held out against them as much as I could.

434
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Please return to being as strong as you were, Brother-in-Law.

435
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,980
Haven't you slept at all last night?

436
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,430
How is he doing?

437
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,810
It's a relief his fever is gone.  He's past the crisis.

438
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,160
Then all we need is to procure that tasty and healthy wild ginseng.

439
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,900
What are you going to do?

440
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,250
What else? I'll have to climb walls if I must

441
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,280
Don't tell me... You cannot be a thief again.

442
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,630
Then, what? Don't just say I shouldn't, come up with an alternative option.

443
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,490
You don't even have another option.

444
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,240
Give it to me.

445
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,470
- You should care about health.
 - Greetings, monk.

446
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,780
I was passing by.  May I have a sip of water?

447
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,890
Yes, Monk.

448
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,320
I can't just leave because I've been treated to the Nectar of Dharma.

449
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,450
I wish you the best luck in this town.

450
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,170
Homage to the Bodhisattva Guan Yin.

451
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,830
This family is the richest and most wicked household in Jangdan County.

452
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,540
During the Japanese invasion, they siphoned military food supplies.

453
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,400
practiced usury with that and became rich.

454
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,630
- They deserve to die. 
 - I'll say.

455
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,590
By stealing military provisions, they starved the soldiers and

456
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,020
starved the soldiers' families through usury.

457
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,280
They killed the people twice.

458
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,400
Right.  They're really bad people.

459
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,080
Shall I rob them?

460
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,900
No.

461
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,240
What now?

462
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,010
It's not enough to merely rob them.

463
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,860
Here.

464
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,570
Who drew this?

465
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,760
I know it wasn't you.

466
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,880
That's not important. Can you make it or not?

467
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,010
I can't make it exactly.

468
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,520
It just needs to get close. That's all that matters.

469
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,780
How many horses?

470
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,690
(How many horses?)

471
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,350
Why two? Why not three or four?

472
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,930
Three is for secret royal inspectors!

473
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,780
Two horses look the best to me. Just two.

474
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,330
She really was the one who drew this.

475
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,680
I'll have it made for you, so come for it tomorrow.

476
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,780
I have one request.

477
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,910
You're already freeloading off me, but you have a request on top of that?

478
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,030
Hey! Back in the day when you were dying at Cheonggye Stream,&nbsp;I—

479
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,650
Yeah, keep milking me for the rest of my life, you rotten blackguard!

480
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,320
I told you, this was the last time!

481
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,840
I want you to spread some rumors for me.

482
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,830
What kind of rumor?

483
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,620
Kim Gae Si.

484
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,550
You don't know who Kim Gae Si is?

485
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,320
So she's a good-for-nothing high-ranking court lady. She sent out some people from the royal treasury...

486
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,870
 Selling legal wife certificates

487
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,780
They are selling legal wife certificates.

488
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,870
Legal wife certificates?

489
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,850
You don't need to know. Oh right!

490
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,250
So this... this really is the last thing.

491
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,800
Could you get us two sets of silk noblemen's clothes and two horses?

492
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,630
Get lost!

493
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,540
I'm dying!

494
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:50,310
Hearing you sound like a pig getting his gullet pulled out, I guess you haven't died yet.

495
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:56,110
I thought those cold-blooded men came back for another session of leg-screw torture!

496
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,500
When will they move her grave?

497
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,970
By saying we shouldn't move the grave on a cursed day,

498
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,200
I was able to buy us some time.

499
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,340
If they move the grave,  they'll find out that the coffin is empty.

500
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,510
What do you plan to do?

501
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:25,060
Before that happens, we must find your sister-in-law at any cost and put her in that coffin.

502
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,750
Have someone follow Court Lady Jo.

503
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,820
You mean someone besides Sam Wol?

504
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:37,110
If things go awry, even if it is Court Lady Jo's, shouldn't we put someone's body in that coffin?

505
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,390
It hurts...

506
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,710
It hurts!

507
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,010
What kind of man fusses about pain so much?

508
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,570
I'm done.

509
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,760
No you're not. There's one more spot left.

510
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,560
W-where do you mean?

511
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,660
Below where you just applied the paste.

512
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,090
Below where?

513
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,450
I don't see it...

514
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,040
Where is—

515
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,280
You disgusting scoundrel!

516
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,170
Oh dear me!

517
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,220
H-hurry and pull your shirt back down.

518
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,160
Court Lady Jo.

519
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,630
Wh-what do you need?

520
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,770
Since when were you so pretty?

521
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,580
Stop saying such nonsense and just eat your food.

522
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,400
Can you even laugh in a situation like this?

523
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,050
Because of you spilling everything, your brother or friend will most probably be caught and killed.

524
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,550
Who? Ba Wu?

525
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,850
Come hither!

526
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,090
Come hither!

527
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,280
What brings you here?

528
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,600
Oh dear, I dropped this.

529
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,530
For crying out loud, you should be more careful.

530
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,650
I will be more careful, sir.

531
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,270
Mapae? 
  Mapae: A round tablet used by Joseon officials to use government horses.

532
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,920
Yes.  I'm sure it was a mapae which I have only heard about before.

533
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,810
Then, might they be the ones the rumors were talking about, regarding the royal treasury?

534
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,220
It does seem that way, but their faces are a little...

535
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,000
And their voices sound really suspicious.

536
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,400
For now bring them in, and prepare the servants, just in case.

537
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,000
Yes, my lady.

538
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,510
Should I tell them to prepare food too?

539
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,430
Do that.

540
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,510
I thought you were hungry. Why are you only staring at the food?

541
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,670
I just thought of somebody.

542
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,920
Are you talking about Cha Dol?

543
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,880
 Chun Bae, please just stay alive.

544
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,010
Is my Court Lady Jo here yet?

545
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,600
I'm so bored.

546
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,630
Court Lady Jo.

547
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,420
Court Lady Jo.

548
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,690
Everything Chun Bae said was true.

549
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:51,250
However, ever since Ba Wu left the temple at a young age, he hasn't returned.

550
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,730
What about the men we sent to Paju? Did they find anything?

551
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,650
Forgive me.

552
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,590
However, I left the men there.

553
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,060
If they find anything, they'll report to me right away.

554
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,930
If it's true that he lived in Paju before,

555
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,290
then the rumor that someone has seen Sister-in-law there must be true, too.

556
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,320
Draw her portrait again and send it to the men in Paju once more.

557
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,980
Yes.

558
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,960
I am Mr. Yi who lives in Hanyang.

559
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,150
We've been had.

560
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,790
It looks like our secret identity has been uncovered.

561
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,890
It does appear so.

562
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,990
Lady An has such discerning eyes.

563
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,190
Let me introduce myself again.

564
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,820
I am Eunuch Yi from the royal treasury.

565
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,040
The treasury is wholly under the charge of eunuchs, Mother.

566
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,710
So that is why your voice and face are.. please forgive me.

567
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,290
This is my first time meeting a eunuch, so I mistook you.

568
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,560
Not at all. It happens often, so don't fault yourself.

569
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,150
Then this gentleman?

570
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,550
This man is in Court Lady Kim Gae Si's personal employee.

571
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,370
I've heard a lot about the lady as the king's favorite!

572
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,030
We're grateful that the king makes much of her.

573
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:32,380
Then what brings you to a backwaters place like this?

574
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:40,260
Since things have already turned out this way, why don't you tell them everything, my lord?

575
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,760
Carelessly talking about this could get even a lord into trouble.

576
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,620
Well, I suppose.

577
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,600
Among the available purchasable government certificates, have you heard of the wife certificates?

578
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,110
I've heard of government certificates, but this is the first time I've heard of a wife certificate.

579
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,800
With that, even a wife of a scholar with no government position

580
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,730
can advance to 2nd or 3rd senior ranks,

581
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:13,280
attaining titles like Jeong and Suk, just like the 2nd and 3rd rank officer's wives.

582
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,570
These certificates are particularly valuable for concubines.

583
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,600
Because of the law prohibiting a concubine's child from obtaining a government position,

584
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,690
their mother getting a wife rank is crucial to their advancement.

585
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,890
Mother, we must buy this.

586
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,350
Sell me one of those certificates.

587
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,370
- Were you not the first wife? 
 - I'm not.

588
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,630
What to do?

589
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,150
Just seeing the dignity of the wife, and the devoted bearing of the young master,

590
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,990
I thought you would obviously be the first wife.

591
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,520
Then what happened to the first wife?

592
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,360
That wench who couldn't produce a son was ousted a long time ago.

593
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,200
Then... she was sent to her family's home?

594
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,570
Do you think a woman ousted by her husband's home would be welcomed by her own?

595
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,930
I imagine she would be begging somewh—

596
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,230
Right now, that wretched woman is not important.

597
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,780
How much to buy that certificate?

598
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,410
It's such a precious item.

599
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,210
With so many people demanding it, the price of it is...

600
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,930
If I become a legal wife,

601
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,660
if my precious son can become a government official,

602
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,430
if I had that much, I would give you billions of nyang.

603
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,060
Please sell me one.

604
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,660
I beg this of you!

605
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,910
We beg this of you.

606
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,300
Sir Physician!

607
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,790
Sir Physician!

608
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,820
Move! Move!

609
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,420
Sir Physician! Sir Physician!

610
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,550
My mother collapsed again. Please look at her!

611
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,890
Take her away.

612
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,380
Please, even a few acupunctural needles is all I ask for, Sir Physician!

613
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,070
Her vitality is failing, it isn't something that can be solved with needles!

614
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,790
If you don't want to have her funeral here, take her away!

615
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,390
Then... at least some medicine!

616
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,270
You need to bring me money for me to give you medicine, you fool!

617
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,060
Take her away.

618
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,320
If you're here, come in. What are you doing dawdling at the gates?

619
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,360
Sir Physician! Sir Physician!

620
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,530
You have to save my mother!

621
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,660
Sir Physician!

622
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,400
Please, just a little medicine. Just a little medicine!

623
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,980
Did you bring the money?

624
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,810
Just hand over the wild ginseng.

625
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,990
For a physician, you can't even spare compassion for these people suffering from disease.

626
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,990
How could you be this obsessed with money?

627
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,610
I can't even imagine the physician you learned medicine from.

628
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,890
Has he even taught you the basics of medicine?

629
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,310
I learned it from Lord Gu Am, why?

630
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,330
Wh-who is Gu Am?

631
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,350
Don't you know the Royal Physician Heo Jun who wrote "Dongui Bogam of Eastern Medicine", you ignorant fool?

632
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,090
Do I look like a physician to know those kinds of things?

633
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:40,150
Then, did your wife work as a female physician in the palace to know who Lord Gu Am was?

634
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,190
I guess she could've gotten treatment from him at some point.

635
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,020
You little ...! Who do you think he is?!

636
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,820
That man is a royal physician. Royal physician!

637
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,430
So that's why—!

638
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:54,310
For someone who supposedly studied under Gu Am, did you not read the "Treatise on Medicine" by King Sejo?

639
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,280
I don't expect you to pay attention to your patient's emotional health,

640
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,050
but you're a failed physician, only interested in your patients' money. You should be ashamed!

641
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,060
Do you think I wanted to do this?!

642
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,890
Who doesn't want to treat those people?

643
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,820
Does medicine just magically sprout from the ground wherever you dig?

644
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,570
This won't end in a couple of days.

645
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,160
What do you want me to do with people that even the king couldn't help?

646
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,850
And what about my household? Should I starve them to treat everyone too?

647
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,140
I understand. I understand.

648
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:23,920
I fully understand your position now, so just bring out the wild ginseng.

649
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,670
You have to bring money for me to give you the ginseng.

650
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,780
What are you waiting for? Let's hurry and give him the money so we can take the ginseng.

651
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,810
Take this and start treating the people waiting outside.

652
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,760
Are you crazy?!

653
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,860
And with this, feed them some rice.

654
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,160
I'll procure the money for the wild ginseng again.

655
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,410
Hey!

656
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,490
- How impudent! 
 - To hell with my impudence!

657
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,790
Look here! What are you thinking?

658
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,880
Do you still think you're—?

659
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,760
Do you still think you're a princess?

660
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,760
It's because I'm not a princess that I can do all of this.

661
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,600
Let's cease bickering and leave.

662
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,190
We have to make new wife certificates. There is much work to do.

663
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,510
Congratulations on becoming 3rd rank, Lady Suk!

664
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,150
I also would like to congratulate you.

665
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:43,580
Senior 3rd rank legal wife.  I would like to congratulate you sincerely on becoming the senior wife.

666
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,320
If you wait a little while, you'll receive a letter of appointment.

667
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,300
Oh, thank you very much!

668
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,350
Thank you.

669
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,030
Please examine my grandfather, too.

670
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:29,590
How does it feel? Saving the people that even the king couldn't save.

671
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,650
Well, it's not that bad.

672
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,720
But doesn't it look like there are more patients than before?

673
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,470
They've more than increased,

674
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,880
I've taken in more apprentices, but I don't even have enough time to eat.

675
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,290
Has this man lost his mind? How can you bring in more patients?!

676
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:44,210
What am I supposed to do? Rumors exploded

677
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,510
about the free food, beds, and treatment. Of course, I'm over capacity.

678
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,990
- Sir Physician! 
 - Yes!

679
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,390
All right! I'm coming!

680
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,630
Let's talk later, all right?

681
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,380
So what are you going to do now?

682
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,330
What else can we do? We have to visit one more home.

683
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,850
They say, "A thief who learns late doesn't notice the hours passing." They were talking about you!

684
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,590
What do you mean, "thief"? There are nicer words. like "righteous outlaw".

685
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,920
Why don't you just be Hong Gil Dong*?
  (A bandit helping the poor)

686
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,420
Come to think of it, you can't call your father, "Father," just like him—
  (Hong Gil Dong was illegitimate)

687
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,570
Please ease your wrath, Your Majesty.

688
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:46,090
All of this is the fault of the Left State Councillor who is trying to impede your great resolution.

689
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,510
Do you truly believe that?

690
00:57:54,270 --> 00:58:02,170
If the calves are larger than the thighs, you can't walk quickly.

691
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,670
Please do as you wish.

692
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,350
The calves are larger than the thighs, you say?

693
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:15,000
You also believe that Yi I Cheom's influence is greater than mine.

694
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,470
I apologize, Your Majesty.

695
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,420
That wasn't what I meant—

696
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:27,120
If it isn't, go ahead and explain, what do you mean?

697
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,060
Your Majesty—

698
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,180
Explain what it was you meant.

699
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,060
Did I not tell you to explain yourself!

700
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,060
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

701
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,930
Get out of my sight.

702
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,060
Your Majesty...

703
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,680
I said, get out of my sight.

704
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,290
Hwa In...

705
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,670
Hwa In...

706
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,560
Hwa In...

707
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,380
Hwa In...

708
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,540
Hwa In...

709
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,560
The view is spectacular.

710
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,830
Is it to your liking?

711
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,850
How is it?

712
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:22,380
Would this much not be enough for you?

713
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,750
Now.

714
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,450
Here.

715
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,390
My lady!

716
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,070
What is it?

717
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,990
Well...

718
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,570
Who is it?

719
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:50,930
He says he is an officer from the royal treasury.

720
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,520
What did you say?

721
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,160
You must capture them immediately!

722
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,350
I was told by Court Lady Kim to be wary of ruffians who would impersonate the eunuch and harass ignorant people.

723
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,710
It's those very people!

724
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,550
Come to think of it, I remember the head of the royal treasury saying that when I was leaving the palace.

725
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,780
What are you doing?

726
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,700
You must immediately have your servants capture those ruffians!

727
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,760
Then do you mean those men are frauds?

728
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,280
What do you think will happen if those people realize you knew and run away?

729
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,750
- You must capture them immediately. 
  - Yes!

730
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,710
We must leave!

731
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,330
Look here!

732
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,670
How dare you!

733
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,870
Who the heck are you?  How dare you impersonate a eunuch?

734
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,520
What do you mean by "impersonate"?  I am Yi Deok Pal from the royal treasury.

735
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,910
Who in the world are you two?

736
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:33,100
Gracious.  This is the real Eunuch, Yi Deok Pal.

737
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,190
What? You're Yi Deok Pal?

738
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,730
Yes! I am Yi Deok Pal! Who are you?

739
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:50,090

740
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,990
 I owe a life's debt to this man. He rescued me.

741
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:57,550
 Permit Hwa In's grave to be moved.

742
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,420
 If the calves are larger than the thighs...

743
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,210
 Hwa In.

744
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,780
 You can't walk quickly.

745
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,790
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

746
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,250
 Because of me, you and Cha Dol are being chased and are in danger.

747
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,490
 Don't do it again.

748
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,930
 Do you per chance consider these your new family, and do you intend to live with them?

749
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,990
 You must bring her back alive, understand?

750
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,300
 Dae Yeop is troubling me,

751
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,450
 Investigate every single person he's interacted with.

752
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,390
 Let's do a job together.

753
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,900
 Are you telling me to put my head into the jaws of a tiger?

754
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,440
 This is the only way to help the princess.
- Tell him that we've started to carry out the plan.

755
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,610
 It's a fire! It's a fire!

756
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,970
 Everything will be over the moment you get caught.

757
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,880
 I will leave first.

758
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,660
 Every single person who knows you will be harmed.

759
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,560
 One of you two must die here.
