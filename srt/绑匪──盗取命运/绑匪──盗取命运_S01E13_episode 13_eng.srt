1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,540
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,510
 Kwon Yu-ri

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,140
 Shin Hyun-soo

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,010

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,980
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,540
 This is really the place, right?

7
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,560
 It must be that widow in the mourning clothes.

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,220
 Who are you?

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,650
 We must inform His Majesty.

10
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,840
 That won't do.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,970
 My father is really helpless.

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,020
 You didn't know? This ahjumma is her highness the princess.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,250
 You must find her at all costs. Our family's fate depends on this matter.

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,140
 And please tell Hwa In to come to the palace tomorrow.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,840
 Only the dead will keep their lips sealed.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,190
 Who are you saying has died?

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,660
 The daughter-in-law of this noble household, her highness the princess, hung herself.

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:22,080
  When my daughter-in-law is found, wherever it may be, and whoever sees, make sure to kill her.

19
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,600
 - Let's go. 
 - How can I run away by myself?

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
 Please go first. I'll follow close behind!

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,800
 Please spare my sister-in-law.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,290
 That's impossible. We cannot endanger our family just for your sister-in-law's sake.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,720
 Please die, Your Highness.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,030
 Find Hwa In.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
 Secretly keep a close eye on the Left State Councillor.

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,180
 If he kills Princess Hwa In, bring that evidence to me.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,100
 The fact that Your Highness is alive will be trouble to his majesty, the king.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,220
 Perhaps ... a true revolt will happen.

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,450
 I'm telling you to start living for yourself!

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,990
 I have no reason to live.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,410
 We all just live like this!

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,120
 It would have been better, even for your sake, if I had died.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,560
 Like you, I'm already a dead person.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,400
 From now on, I'm not "Your Highness,"

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,440
 I'm going to live as a commoner.

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 Why do you try to push me to an even more perilous cliff edge?

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,560
 If it brings death, I will be the one to die in your place.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 And if that's impossible, I will die with you.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,820
 If you don't give up on me to the end, I will disappear.

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,040
 Let's do a job together. It's the only way to save my sister-in-law.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,400
 This Myeon Sa Cheol Gwon grants you a pardon from any crime,

42
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,450
 as long as it isn't treason.

43
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,100
 Haven't you seen Dae Yeop?

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,910
 Behead the ringleader of the treason, Kim Je Nam!

45
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,960
 If we are caught now, everyone you know will not be safe.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,490
 You were my enemy too! You were that bastard's son.

47
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,570
 Princess Hwa In is alive.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,670
 Forgive me, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,780
 We're going to leave this place so start packing our things.

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,300
 - Why exactly are you doing this?
- I don't want to be entangled with you even for a moment.

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,240
 If I told you to leave, I thought you'd make all kinds of excuses and not leave! That's why we are going to leave.

52
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,220
 We captured the women as you requested,

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,620
 at the latest they should arrive by tonight.

54
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,690
 Without your orders, no one will even see the shadow of the princess.

55
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,860
 Are you that worried?

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,850
 Even if it's by myself, I must go in.

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,590
 Answer me. Do you want to live?

58
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,290
 Yes, I want to live.

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,300
 Suicide, you say?

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,750
 So you aren't a princess any longer. You are just a woman.

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,300
 The one whom I want to protect with my life.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,680
 I heard your sister-in-law's drawing skill is extra-ordinary.

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,930
 Hey, this will bring money, I tell you! Erotica!

64
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,590
 What has the police bureau been doing, allowing such vile books to circulate?

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,600
 I think I've seen the drawings somewhere. Please trust and leave this to me, Hyeong-nim.

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,520
 It's that man. He's the man who made the drawings.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,220
 Just forget everything and live as you've been doing.

68
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,530
 I intended to live my life as Ba Wu, forgetting both my enemy and about vengeance.

69
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,860
 But your family has made me into Lord Kim Je Nam's grandson Kim Dae Seok.

70
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,300
 All of that resentment, and your family... you gave all of that up for my sake?

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,380
 No matter the cost... I'll make sure to return to your side in one piece.

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,540
 The left police division conducted the investigation, so surely the ledger will be in the hands of the left police chief.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,290
  Kim Je Nam's eldest grandson is alive.

74
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,390
 The criminal locked in the royal investigation bureau is Kim Je Nam's grandson, Kim Dae Seok.

75
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,020
 I understand there is a second ledger.

76
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,000
 Why do you think you are here?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,320
 It must be because I am of use. Please restore my name.

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,030
 Pass the military service exam.

79
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,850
 Find a way to kill that rascal.

80
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,890
 If you truly support Hwa In and me, prove it.

81
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,220
 Be my sword and shield at my side.

82
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,960
  You are to report every little thing your father does to me.

83
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,660
 Restore the status of everyone involved in Kim Je Nam's case during the ousting of Prince Yeongchang!

84
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,020
 It seems that he is definitely hiding something.

85
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,830
 That man is a bait. A bait to lure in Yi I Cheom.

86
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,960
 You have until the incense burns completely to fire three shots.

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
 During the rifle shooting test,

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,320
 disguise it as an accidental firing and shoot Kim Dae Seok.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,550
You have until the incense burns completely to fire three shots.

90
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,160
Fire the shot!

91
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,990
Look here, are you all right?

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,830
You can't get up.

93
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,030
Stand aside.

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,090
I have one shot left.

95
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,470
You're low. Aim a little higher.

96
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,260
Shoot.

97
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,430
 Episode 13

98
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,230
Minister of Defense, you must question the culprit.

99
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,160
Make sure to find out if it is something he did by himself,

100
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,920
or if there's someone behind him.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,590
Look here. Are you awake?

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,500
- Where is...? 
 - It's the physician's quarters of the training hall.

104
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,490
I guess you don't remember?

105
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,620
I remember up until being hit by the rifle shot.

106
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,960
It was really a close call.

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,830
 See me for a moment.

108
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,890
-  Accept this. 
  - What is this?

109
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,190
 Wear this underneath. It will be helpful.

110
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,460
I am alive because of you.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,330
I won't forget this kindness.

112
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,040
Thank His Majesty. I only followed his orders.

113
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,700
How are you feeling?

114
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,770
It's bearable.

115
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,090
More importantly, what happened to my military service exam?

116
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,730
You've passed, so don't worry.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,230
It hasn't been announced yet so just know for yourself.

118
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,590
- Yes.
 - Don't overexert yourself for the time being.

119
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,230
Are you all right?

120
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,160
Your father started it first.

121
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,430
Why is Cha Dol's father so late?

122
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,030
You go and take a look outside.

123
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,190
He's coming now.

124
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,260
Father.

125
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,200
Did your test go well? 
  (using casual speech)

126
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,990
Cha Dol, you should use honorific speech with your father.

127
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,870
He'll get better as we go.

128
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,590
- Did your test go well? 
 - Yes.

129
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,590
You look very tired. Go on and rest.

130
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,730
Yes.

131
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,470
The fate of the family name rests on his shoulders, so it won't be easy for him.

132
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,360
So make sure he is well taken care of. Do you understand?

133
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,730
Yes.

134
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,560
You were shot by a rifle?

135
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,630
- Let me take a look.
 - It's fine. I'm all right.

136
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,230
This is a real problem. You could die if you keep this up.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,660
Man, you can't even escape, as you used to before.

138
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,130
We might end up as sitting ducks here. What shall we do now?

139
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,770
What else can we do? We have to return the favor.

140
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,700
If they mess with either me or my family, they must at least expect death in return.

141
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,530
At least then, they will think twice about it in the future.

142
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,130
We should have used this opportunity to kill him.

143
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,560
He is quite resilient.

144
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,730
Still, it probably served as plenty of warning.

145
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,230
You look ... are you all right?

146
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,400
Is it that obvious?

147
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,480
Don't worry. It's nothing serious.

148
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,280
I understand you're covering this because you don't want to worry your family.

149
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,920
But occasionally lean on your family, when you're going through a difficult time.

150
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,630
It's in their best interest too.

151
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,950
Please rest. I will bring you your dinner table.

152
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,710
You pretended to not notice?

153
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,360
It's so obvious that he's hiding his injuries to not worry his family.

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,550
I just couldn't bring myself to ask him about it.

155
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,510
But he injured his ribs.

156
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,250
Who is going to care for his injuries?

157
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,270
I'll leave that in your hands.

158
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,190
Yes, I understand.

159
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,860
The left state councillor will likely continue to harass Cha Dol's father.

160
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,100
What should we do?

161
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,000
Good work.

162
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,410
I will call you when the time is right. I want you to lie low until things calm down.

163
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,560
Yes, my lord.

164
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,540
Are you just letting him go?

165
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,680
What are you doing here?

166
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,600
Aren't you overstepping your bounds?

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,260
His majesty will not stand still for this.

168
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,480
What if he doesn't? What can he do?

169
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,900
Under whose authority did you let him free?

170
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,380
Your Majesty, we merely dealt with the problem according to the law.

171
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,910
According to the Gyeongguk code of laws, someone who accidentally injured another person

172
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,630
is to receive floggings, and to pay for the funeral expenses for the victim.

173
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,910
Accident? Accident?!

174
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,530
The man dropped his bullets, and in his panic he accidentally—

176
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,810
I will interrogate him personally,

177
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,010
so go, arrest, and bring him back again at once!

178
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,210
You must not do this, Your Majesty!

179
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,300
Without definitive evidence, we cannot handle this with personal feelings.

180
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,720
Please hear our pleas, Your Majesty!

181
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,630
- Please hear our pleas! 
 - Please hear our pleas!

182
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,410
Whose subjects are you anyway?!

183
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,590
How could you say such harsh things?

184
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,150
Please spare us from your wrath, Your Majesty.

185
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,260
- Please spare us from your wrath! 
 - Please spare us from your wrath!

186
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,680
Get out of my sight.

187
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,650
I said leave!

188
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,960
Jung Yeong, are you outside?

189
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,880
My head feels as if it's splitting open.

190
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,180
Hurry... hurry and get me my medicine.

191
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,290
His majesty's madness is getting more and more severe.

192
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,930
I'm concerned about the future of Joseon.

193
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,550
I'm worried if it'll get worse...

194
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,560
I don't know if we should consider having the crown prince start a regency on his behalf.

195
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,760
- Already? 
 - Proxy ruling

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,020
Now, now. This isn't the place for this.

197
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,240
Whether it's about making the crown prince a regent or the abdication of the throne, let's discuss this in the meeting chamber.

198
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:17,360
Have Kim Dae Seok and Yi Dae Yeop come see me immediately.

199
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,380
Yes, Your Majesty!

200
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,790
Please be wary of my father.

201
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,980
Don't worry.

202
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,200
- I'm off, Mother. 
 - Please be careful.

203
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,250
Don't worry.

204
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,920
I'll be back soon.

205
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,720
Please return safely.

206
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,450
Have a safe trip.

207
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,030
Your Majesty, it's time to leave for your Confucian lessons.

208
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,140
Your Majesty...

209
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,990
Lift your heads.

210
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,170
You worthless fools.

211
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,070
I was certain I told you to report to me every little thing your father did.

212
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,730
What were you doing when your father planned to kill him?

213
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,810
And you, will you continue to be a victim your whole life?

214
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,510
Now that your title is restored and Hwa In is hidden away safely...

215
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,940
It seems you two have grown lazy and slothful.

216
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,310
Shall I call Hwa In in immediately and reveal everything that's happened?

217
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,290
If that were to happen, Hwa In will probably become a Buddhist nun,

218
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,110
and spend the rest of her days in a temple.

219
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,910
Shall I make her that way for you?

220
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,370
The choice is in the hands of you two.

221
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,250
What will you do?

222
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,070
Allow me to leave the palace at the end of my shift.

223
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,490
I will come up with a plan.

224
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,000
And you?

225
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,160
Allow Kim Dae Seok to return home at the end of his shift.

226
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,630
I will give you two weeks. Have a solution ready by then.

228
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,390
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - You may leave now.

229
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,180
Yes.

230
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,610
Why haven't you answered yet?

231
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,020
Have you given up on Hwa In?

232
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:16,350
What? Are you afraid that I will use your information to kill your father?

233
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,120
Don't worry. What I desire...

234
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,980
is for your father to willingly retire, just as his predecessor Jeong In Hong did before him.

235
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,960
Things may have gotten messy because of Hwa In...

236
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,640
But your father was someone who helped me ascend the throne and has supported me since then.

237
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,490
Therefore, it is no small burden for me to decide to kill him instead.

238
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,960
It's not as if your father would quietly die either.

239
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,370
It would only spark a war that would result in chaos and confusion in the royal court.

240
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,920
Rather than going that route, if I could have your father's weakness,

241
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,970
I think having him quietly resign would be the best method.

242
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,060
What will you do?

243
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,710
I will follow Your Majesty's orders.

244
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,810
Good. You've made a difficult choice.

245
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:13,620
I will remember that you and Hwa In had an affection for each other since childhood.

246
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,370
You may leave now.

247
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,220
What's wrong? Does it seem he doesn't believe me?

248
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,410
It's not that, Your Majesty.

249
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,080
I was merely concerned.

250
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,150
People will believe in what they want to believe.

251
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,500
This is the only way he can win Hwa In.

252
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,280
He will have to trust me, even if he doesn't want to.

253
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,970
What did he say?

254
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,870
Don't delude yourself.

255
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,780
Do you think we're friends?

256
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,330
To you, I'm the son of your enemy, and to me,

257
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,260
you're the foe who is trying to destroy my household.

258
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,660
If it were not for the princess

259
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,230
I would have personally killed you.

260
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,700
Princess.

261
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,880
Did you look for me?

262
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,860
Sit down.

263
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,040
When you used to take part in the smuggling trade,

264
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,090
to your knowledge, where was the silk sold?

265
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,070
I heard that it was sold to merchants in the marketplace...

266
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,090
It's not as if there are only one or two fabric stores.

267
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,490
That—

268
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,780
Back when we used to live at the left state councillor's house,

269
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,000
do you know which fabric store they used to frequent to buy silk and clothing?

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,020
Yes, it was in the marketplace at—

271
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,570
W-wait-

272
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,380
the left state councillor's house?

273
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,630
Why do you want to know about the shop they used to buy from?

274
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,470
There's something I want to look into.

275
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,640
Your Highness, surely you don't plan to go there in person?

276
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,290
It's too dangerous to step outside now. I will go in your place.

277
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,050
Wouldn't the shop owner recognize your face?

278
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,370
Well that may be true, but still...

279
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,410
Aigoo! Welcome! Take your pick.

280
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,740
Your wares are lackluster. Let's go, Sister-in-law.

281
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,820
Excuse me. Are you not able to find what you were looking for?

282
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,950
Nothing like this.

283
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you have anything from overseas?

284
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,000
I do.

285
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,030
This way!

286
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,790
Over here, miladies.

287
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,780
- Wow! 
 - Now, please come in.

288
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,720
Now!

289
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,430
How much do you need?

290
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,780
For starters, I'd like five rolls of each color.

291
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,490
If my in-laws are pleased, I will come back again.

292
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,980
Oh my, it seems you're preparing for a wedding.

293
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,500
Then you will need to prepare a wedding gift* to the groom's family. On top of that, new blankets and clothes... 
 (typically silk)

294
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,120
Oh dear, I think five rolls will be too few for that.

295
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,940
Are the fabrics in this room all you can offer?

296
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,550
No, this isn't everything. We only need your order,

297
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,390
and I will have everything ready.

298
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,580
Mother!

299
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,250
What did you buy so many things for?

300
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,830
This isn't a lot at all.

301
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,130
Since it's spring, I should make new clothes for the family.

302
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,150
And I thought we could use some spring blankets, so I got them in advance.

303
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,670
You're right. Good, I understand.

304
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,740
- Bring them inside. 
 - Wow!

305
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,260
It's all thanks to your brother.

306
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,530
I got it already! It's all because of my brother.

307
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,010
Of course, of course. It's all thanks to your impressive son. Ow!

308
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,080
Stop, before I break your wrists.

309
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,490
- Move aside! 
 - There you go again!

310
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,560
Please try to have some dignity.

311
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,630
How could you say you'll break my wrists?

312
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,490
What will you do if your daughter-in-law overhears you?

313
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,780
You... just put away the silk.

314
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,860
That's weird. I was sure I put it here...

315
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,690
What did you do with it?

316
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,730
- What? 
 - The land deed for the property in Icheon.

317
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,820
There's nobody in this house who would think to touch this chest besides you.

318
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,310
Am I wrong?

319
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,910
- You're right. 
 - I'm right?

320
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,010
You crazy... are you in your right mind?

321
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,430
- Have you lost your mind? 
 - Then what was I supposed to do?

322
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,410
I've already had my wedding. Do you want me to live as a widow?

323
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,640
I need to do whatever I can to emancipate Orabeoni Chil Seong and bring him here, right?

324
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,480
- Even so, how could you take the land deed? 
 - Then what should I have done?

325
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,600
Neither you nor Brother would do anything to help me.

326
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,190
Should I also forget about him too?

327
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,840
Fine. When your brother returns, I'll consult with him.

328
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,800
So give me the land deed now.

329
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
I don't have it.

330
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,670
I've already sent it to Cheonan.

331
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,340
What? When?

332
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,460
It's been some time. By now I should've gotten at least a message or someone with news.

333
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,840
What are we supposed to do? If your brother found out about this...!

334
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,030
It's not as if his name is written on this silk.

335
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,450
How can we prove that these rolls of silk were the same ones that the left state councillor smuggled in from Ming?

336
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,460
Because of the northern barbarians, all of the land routes to Ming have been blocked off.

337
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,840
How else could they import these fabrics?

338
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,860
It must've gotten here through smuggling.

339
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,970
Furthermore, the left state counsillor couldn't have received any bribery from elsewhere.

340
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,010
How else would he procure the funds to commit treason?

341
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,040
You may bow to each other now!

342
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,360
I hope you live happily Chil Seong!

343
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,630
Wait...

344
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,690
Why is that scoundrel coming from here?

345
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,310
Why are you doing this to me? Who are you?

346
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,070
Your bride, Yeon Ok's brother.

347
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,630
What?

348
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,510
Not me.

349
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,760
Why were you coming out from there?

350
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,660
Her family had their titles restored and became nobles...

351
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,300
but I am a peasant, am I not?

352
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,440
I was emancipated thanks to her. I couldn't just return empty-handed...

353
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,640
I don't want to hear it. Go back immediately, and tell them you're quitting.

354
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,340
I don't want to.

355
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,810
- What? 
 - I don't have any money, but if there's anything I can do,

356
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,780
I'd like to do it for Yeon Ok and her family's sake.

357
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,000
- Please, just let me do this. 
 - I can't. It's too dangerous.

358
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,430
If I find out anything, I'll pull out of the place immediately.

359
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,160
I told you, I won't allow it! Quit that place immediately.

360
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,920
- Let's go home. 
 - Hey, wait just a second.

361
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,080
Doesn't he look so earnest? Let's at least hear him out.

362
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,020
By chance, do you know where the silk comes from?

363
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,910
I'm still a new hire so I don't know that much yet, but I will look into it!

364
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,120
Then... tell me something about the owner.

365
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,650
I don't know much, but I heard he can't control himself when it comes to gambling.

366
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,330
Gambling?

367
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,770
Then... me too!

368
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,050
Let me borrow some urgent money.

369
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,170
- How much? 
 - Just give me five nyang.

370
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,220
Five nyang, you say?

371
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,390
Let's take care of the promissory note first.

372
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,550
Now, let's see them.

373
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,780
- Sorry to see your loss.
 - Ah, seriously!

374
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,440
Ah, sorry to do this.

375
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,950
Excuse me, let me borrow some money in advance.

376
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,860
Do you have any collateral to offer?

377
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,430
I'll offer my fabric store's wares for it.

378
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,130
Your fabric store, you say...

379
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,990
For two hundred rolls of cotton, I'll give you a hundred nyang.

380
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,140
Hund—A hundred nyang?

381
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,020
Isn't that a little too much?

382
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,950
You can just win and pay it back. Don't be so stingy!

383
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
I got it. Give it to me.

384
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,880
Now... first the promissory note.

385
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,190
Now, here you go.

386
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,020
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks. And here you go.

387
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,230
Ah, I lost again!

388
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,550
Excuse me.

389
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,560
Let me sign another note.

390
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,980
How much will you give me for a hundred rolls of silk?

391
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,510
Hund—a hundred rolls?!

392
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,530
Come now, don't do that.

393
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,030
- You should stop here. 
 - Yes, you should stop.

394
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,350
No, no, no! I've decided. So... how much will it be?

395
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,530
I really shouldn't do this...

396
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,820
Wow, what a man!

397
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,540
Now... you should pay up on your debt, right?

398
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,210
Gambling debt isn't real debt.

399
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,810
What?

400
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,120
- What are you doing? 
 - I have another!

401
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,840
- Boys! 
 - Yes!

402
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,660
What's this?

403
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,300
One, two... move for a second. Three, four...

404
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,570
- Hey, boys! 
 - Yes!

405
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,710
Move! Move!

406
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,390
Move, I say!

407
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,520
You'd better move!

408
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,670
Hey, load up!

409
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,510
I'll make good use of the silk.

410
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,510
And...

411
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,740
I'm telling you this out of pity.

412
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,550
Don't gamble anymore.

413
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,590
And worry about selling your silk instead.

414
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,420
Careful, careful! And take everything!

415
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,590
I hope we can continue working together, Hyeong-nim!

416
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,680
Here!

417
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes...

418
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,410
What are your next plans?

419
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,950
I've emptied his storehouse.

420
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,380
So now I have to make him fill it up again.

421
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
Oh, you're here.

422
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,780
I'd like to see the silk from overseas.

423
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,170
Si-silk?

424
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,460
How much do you need?

425
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,220
As I mentioned before, my sister-in-law will have a wedding soon.

426
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,970
And my mother-in-law will have her 61st birthday feast soon, so I need quite a lot of it.

427
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,590
Can you have them ready right away?

428
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,150
Well the thing is... I've come across a situation.

429
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,480
It's hard to provide them at this moment,  do you need them that urgently?

430
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,660
What a predicament you put me in!

431
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,590
I've trusted your word alone and already informed all of my in-laws.

432
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,330
I suppose it's not too late to find a different store.

433
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,310
Wa-wait! Please wait just a moment.

434
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,700
No matter what it takes, I'll prepare what you need, my lady.

435
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,500
Cost is not an issue, so make sure to have them ready for me.

436
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,080
Yes, of course! Don't you worry!

437
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,320
He's taken the bait.

438
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,810
The silk storage chest is empty, so they will have no alternative but to bring in new supplies to fill it.

439
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,910
Thank you and I'm sorry.

440
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,480
Please leave the work to me in the future.

441
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,810
No. Just as you have taken care of me,

442
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,700
I will do anything to take care of you.

443
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,570
Why are you looking at me like that?

444
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,280
Truly, you are beautiful.

445
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,290
Did you just realize that?

446
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,580
Now that I'm looking at you...

447
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,050
Your forehead is smooth and beautiful and the line of your nose is high.

448
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,240
The lips too ...

449
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,260
There is no one more beautiful than you in all of the eight provinces of Joseon.

450
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,960
At least, not in my eyes.

451
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,670
Mother is waiting.

452
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,220
Wait, let's go together!

453
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,370
♫  The hand which hugged me  ♫

454
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:40,080
♫  is gently caught in my collar  ♫

455
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,100
♫  it hurts.  ♫

456
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,820
- Go right in. 
 - All right.

457
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,490
- You're back. 
 - I'm sorry. Am I very late?

458
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,230
Not at all.

459
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,400
Let's do it together.

460
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,240
You!  What have you been doing since early this morning?

461
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,420
Doesn't it bother you even a little that your mother-in-law is starving?

462
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,950
Mother, be dignified!

463
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,120
You stay out of it.

464
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,370
They say that if you don't bring in a good daughter-in-law, the family will be ruined.

465
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,600
I suppose I will be the first to starve.

466
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,770
I'm sorry.  I will do it so that it will be ready soon.

467
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,240
Mother, let's go in.

468
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,680
Why are you sitting like this again?

469
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,880
This is what life as a new bride is like. So don't be too upset over it.

470
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,220
There was still so much time left before supper!

471
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,590
Hey.  Eat this. It will make you feel better.

472
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,500
Instead of doing that, try tasting this.

473
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,300
I don't have the appetite.

474
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,500
Try it once, even if you don't feel like it.  I ran around for a half hour to buy this.

475
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,830
What did you spend a half hour getting?

476
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,750
What ... dried persimmon?

477
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,150
Court lady ... no ... Yeo Ju Daek, you like dried persimmons.

478
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,270
This is a Sangju dried persimmon. It's really delicious.

479
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,820
When I'm feeling down, if I eat something delicious, it makes me feel better.

480
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,360
Flower.   Dried persimmon.

481
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,690
Her highness the consort loved this.

482
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,390
Follow me.

483
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,890
Is it today? Isn't the day too bright?

484
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,470
Her highness the consort?  Who is she?

485
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,830
Would you cry at a funeral without knowing who died! 
  (idiom for "Why are you so clueless?")

486
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,490
She is the princess' mother.

487
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,030
- Ah, Ba Wu's mother-in-law.
 - Do you have a death wish?

488
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,320
Why? When the princess acquired a mother-in-law and  sister-in-law,

489
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,750
Ba Wu would have made some in-laws as well.

490
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
Then is the king "father-in-law?"

491
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,530
Oh, is that that how that works?

492
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,500
How can you do that?  How can you? How dare you speak of the king that way?

493
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,790
All right. All right.

494
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,480
- So, which highness? 
 - Her highness, the Rank 2 Noble Royal Consort.

495
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,600
So you want the princess and that royal consort to meet?

496
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,500
Yes. Isn't there a way?

497
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,220
She's a noblewoman who lives in the palace. What can we do about that?

498
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,660
It would be faster to talk to Ba Wu instead.

499
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,330
If I wanted to talk to Ba Wu, I would've just done that instead. Why would I be wasting time with you?

500
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,420
As to that, well, I am trustworthy

501
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,820
and we also have some things we need to work out.

502
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,690
Forget it. It's fine so be that trustworthy brute and chop us some firewood.

503
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,370
Oh, oh, oh.  You'll be in big trouble if you go near the palace.

504
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,290
We're done talking.  Here ...

505
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,930
Court Lady Jo!

506
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,390
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, ma'am.  There is a rumor—

507
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,190
Don't be concerned. I am not a ghost.

508
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,130
Is her highness the consort well and in peace?

509
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,230
How could she be?

510
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,960
After the princess died, she has constantly been in her sickbed.

511
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,690
Please eat.

512
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,700
How bad is she?

513
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,490
Although every day she takes the special tonic

514
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,100
mixed by the king's personal physician per his Majesty's order,

515
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,930
it doesn't seem she is getting any better.

516
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,540
When it's her spirit and not her body that is hurt,

517
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,020
what's the use of any drug?

518
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,930
Do you miss her highness the consort a lot?

519
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,630
It's not too late to at least send her a letter.

520
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,990
I didn't hide this whole time...

521
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,060
because I didn't realize how great her devastation would be, right?

522
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,790
If I were to make a mistake, even my mother could be endangered.

523
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,160
The king knows everything now.

524
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,030
What could possibly go wrong?

525
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,600
 Royal Mother

526
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,090
 Greetings from an unworthy daughter.

527
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,460
 You must be so heartbroken because of this undeserving girl.

528
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,870
 I don't know what I can do about all of my impiety.

529
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,000
 I don't know how to seek forgiveness.

530
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,920
 I am in a safe place, so I pray you will not worry.

531
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,570
 If you will stay strong,

532
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:43,000
 I will survive to see you again.

533
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:03,930
Except for her highness the consort, no one must know of the existence of this letter.

534
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,660
In the event the whereabouts of this letter becomes a problem,

535
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,360
you won't be safe either. Do you understand what I am saying?

536
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,160
Yes, ma'am.  I will bear that in mind.

537
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,760
What are you saying? Court Lady Jo met you?

538
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,460
Yes.  I was told to deliver this letter secretly to her highness the consort.

539
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,930
- Is Court Lady Choi outside? 
 - Yes, ma'am.

540
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,710
Find the deputy administration officer, Kim Ja Jeom, and tell him to see me immediately.

541
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,460
Yes, ma'am.

542
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,960
Deliver it to her highness the consort.

543
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,690
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,130
What did you just say?

545
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Did you say Court Lady Jo?

546
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,230
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,900
All right. You may leave.

548
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,580
Hwa In.

549
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,970
Your Highness, please compose yourself.

550
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,130
You could collapse.

551
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,530
I told you, I saw the letter that Princess Hwa In wrote myself.

552
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,780
It was a letter written to her own mother, and it clearly said,

553
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,840
that she is somewhere safe now, so her mother shouldn't worry.

554
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,420
So where could Princess Hwa In be safe inside the capital?

555
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,590
Someone who has the connections to hide Princess Hwa In,

556
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,370
it can only Kim Dae Seok, isn't that true?

557
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,350
So what has happened?

558
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,820
Didn't you say that you met with Kim Dae Seok before?

559
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,060
Did you actually meet that man?

560
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,690
How could I dare to lie to you?

561
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,990
When I last met with him, he said he parted with the princess the very day he left my home.

562
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,040
And he clearly told me that he doesn't know what happened to her after that.

563
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,830
You are truly frustrating.

564
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,040
Are you really unable to distinguish whether he spoke the truth or a lie?

565
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,290
I apologize.

566
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,550
Please go meet with him again at his home immediately.

567
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,550
She is definitely hiding in his home

568
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,720
and if not, at the very least

569
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,480
he will know where she is staying.

570
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,130
So please find out properly this time. Properly.

571
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,880
Yes, my lady.

572
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm Kim Ja Jeom, the deputy administration officer of the ministry of defense.

573
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,220
You look like the Royal Guard.

574
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,920
On whose command are you guarding this home?

575
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,220
Do you reside in this home?

576
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,290
Ah, yes. May I ask who... ?

577
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,070
Tell him that Kim Ja Jeom, the deputy administration officer of the minister of defense, wants to see him.

578
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,800
Yes.

579
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,500
Oh, oh, big disaster.

580
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,670
That guy is here.

581
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,860
That guy? Which one?

582
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,330
That guy who used slave hunters to capture the princess and Court Lady Jo.

583
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,890
You two stay here, and do not budge. You must never come out! Never!

584
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,120
What brings you all the way here?

585
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,730
I was just passing by.

586
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,630
A pretty nice place for a home that you've prepared rather quickly.

587
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,480
Yes, well... let's go inside.

588
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,550
Who is that man?

589
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,450
He's a friend who looks after the household. This way, please.

590
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,070
And who is living over there?

591
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,300
That's the ladies' quarters, where my mother and my sister are living.

592
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,630
- I should greet your mother since I am here. 
 - Right now—

593
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,540
She is out right now.

594
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,590
Yes? And your sister, too?

595
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,340
Yes, they went out together.

596
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,060
Let us go inside.

597
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,700
What happened?

598
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,230
Ba Wu took him to his room.

599
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,720
Imagine if I wasn't the one who happened to meet him at the door.

600
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,690
Hold on. Isn't it about time for Cha Dol's grandmother and aunt to return?

601
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,400
It doesn't matter if those two meet that man, does it?

602
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,150
It's not that.

603
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,990
What if they say something useless?

604
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:51,440
What brings you all the way to my home?

605
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,540
I was just passing by, and wondered how you were doing.

606
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,070
And I was worried about your gunshot wound, and whether it was healing well.

607
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,070
Gosh, you are worried about me.

608
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,530
I am so grateful I don't know what to do with myself.

609
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,480
Your words are making me sad.

610
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,330
If you want to discuss origins, you and your family are all Westerners like me, aren't you?

611
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,290
Ah, yes. Well.

612
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,410
After all, if not for us Westerners, would it have been possible for your identity to be restored to you?

613
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,010
And, in order to free your aunt* from confinement ... 
  (Queen Inmok)

614
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,090
It was we, the Westerners who made unceasing effort, isn't that true?

615
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,710
Yes.

616
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,380
And now that you've passed the examination and become installed in your office,

617
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,960
time has come for you to do your part as a Westerner.

618
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,830
I am grateful for your words, but I am still lacking in many ways.

619
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,260
Untrue.

620
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,530
You have already gained the favor of His Majesty, haven't you?

621
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,480
That is enough to confirm your abilities.

622
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,660
So begin working with us to push out Yi I Cheom.

623
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,980
Getting rid of Yi I Cheom fulfills your personal objective of taking revenge of your family's mortal enemy.

624
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,290
In addition, isn't it our duty as noblemen to do this for the sake of Joseon's future?

625
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,790
Yes, your words are correct.

626
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,780
So about that,

627
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,320
Princess Hwa In.

628
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,530
There is no better weapon than Princess Hwa In to get rid of Yi I Cheom, is there?

629
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,150
What do you mean

630
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,670
by that, all of a sudden?

631
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,490
Where is Princess Hwa In? You know, don't you?

632
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,250
No.

633
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,750
How can I know that?

634
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,640
As I told you earlier, I do not know anything more about Princess Hwa In.

635
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,350
Is that true?

636
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,450
Why would I lie?

637
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,030
If I knew where Princess Hwa In was,

638
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,790
I would be seeking revenge against Yi I Cheom. Why would I be sitting here?

639
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,110
I even got shot by a rifle because of him.

640
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,400
So you just came right back here after hearing Kim Dae Seok tell you that he really doesn't know?

641
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,190
About that...

642
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,560
I did suspect that Kim Dae Seok was hiding something.

643
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,530
But it's not as if I can search his home. So there wasn't anything I could do.

644
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,400
It's not that you couldn't do anything, it's that you have no skills.

645
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,510
I will check it again.

646
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,400
But, aside from that,

647
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,800
the fact that that home is being guarded by the Royal Guard

648
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,230
is what bothers me even more.

649
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:23,040
Perhaps His Majesty is the one who hid Princess Hwa In in that home?

650
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,550
You are really too much.

651
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,780
How could you hide this even from me?

652
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,370
Since that child died, every single day has been hell for me.

653
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,630
My heart was already broken that she was a young widow.

654
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,810
And her having died so futilely made me pity her so much.

655
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,210
I felt that everything was my fault,

656
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,150
so my only thought was to follow her in death...

657
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,760
And after seeing me like this every day, you still didn't tell me?

658
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,750
You cannot be this cold-hearted.

659
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,030
You cannot be this cruel.

660
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,790
I was in a situation in which I had no choice but to do this.

661
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,410
Of course you were.

662
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,710
I'm sure that you would not

663
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,030
have made a living child into a dead child without reason.

664
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,390
But I am that child's mother.

665
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,880
And that was all the more reason I could not tell you.

666
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,510
A mother dives into water or fire for the sake of her child.

667
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,990
So if you had known that Hwa In was alive,

668
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,080
you would have immediately set out to find her.

669
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,770
And that would have put Hwa In's life into further danger.

670
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,280
In that case,

671
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:58,470
even while knowing that she is alive, must I pretend to not know...

672
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,920
in order for Hwa In to be safe?

673
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,580
It was the left state councillor who said that Hwa In committed suicide.

674
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,350
He deceived me and the entire council.

675
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,540
If he finds out she is still alive,

676
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:19,360
I'm sure you can guess what he will try to do.

677
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,560
I did hide her in a safe place.

678
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,620
But I have not yet devised a way to completely stop the left state councillor.

679
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,480
I cannot tell you more, so please understand.

680
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,400
 You must miss her highness, the Royal Consort Yun very much, don't you?

681
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,740
I am sorry that I couldn't tell you, even while knowing how deep your sorrow was.

682
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:34,410
But please understand that it was the last resort in order to ensure Hwa In's safety.

683
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:41,260
And please believe that I am still doing my best to continue to ensure her safety.

684
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,960
You don't have to say that.

685
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:49,210
If I don't trust you, whom could I trust, Your Majesty?

686
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,270
When I think of Hwa In,

687
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,590
my heart also feels heavy, as if a boulder is tied to it.

688
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:03,040
I know... how precious Hwa In was to you.

689
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,130
I know that better than anyone.

690
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:12,860
How you used to let Hwa In ride on your back

691
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,440
during horse play,

692
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,410
I can still remember that image vividly.

693
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,140
I will trust that you will protect Hwa In no matter what.

694
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,990
And I won't ask you any questions anymore.

695
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:40,510
But I do have one request, so please hear it.

696
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,030
Tell me.

697
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,690
Hwa In...

698
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,510
Just once...

699
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,170
Please allow me to meet her, just once.

700
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,510
I miss her so much.

701
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,930
I cannot hold myself back now that I know she is alive.

702
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,530
Please pity me

703
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,490
and let me at least see just her face.

704
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,980
Please show me your grace.

705
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,900
You know that Royal Consort Yun is Hwa In's mother, don't you?

706
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,370
Yes.

707
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,030
Please find a way for her and Hwa In to meet.

708
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,410
Mother!

709
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,600
Mother.

710
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,390
What's the fuss? You can't behave prudently?

711
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,090
Prudent, or whatever.

712
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,090
- Orabeoni Chil Seong appeared in my dream. 
 - What?

713
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,200
He told me to wait as he will return home soon.

714
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,340
Aigoo, how nice for you.

715
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:15,150
I no longer have to see you sigh as if the floor is collapsing.

716
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,500
When he comes, I should surprise him.

717
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,610
What should I wear?

718
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,230
Oh, my head hurts.

719
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,350
What will people think?

720
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,890
I can't let her keep behaving that way.

721
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,650
I wish there were lessons for conduct.

722
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:41,650
I wish I could send her there.

723
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,210
Mother.

724
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,760
What?

725
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,160
If you leave it to me, I will give it a try.

726
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,020
You?

727
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,060
How regretful, when you almost made it.

728
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,030
Please try it again.

729
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,650
How many more times?

730
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:24,150
Ah, ah, my neck and legs hurt so much.

731
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,350
Quickly, focus my gaze at a point far away,

732
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:47,810
one, two...

733
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,960
I think I'm doing it. I think it's working.

734
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,340
Shall we use chopsticks?

735
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,730
When we chew food, we shouldn't make any noise.

736
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,210
You should chew with your mouth closed.

737
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,680
You are making noise too, Mother!

738
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,330
I am not.

739
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,940
It doesn't look good when you open your mouth with food inside.

740
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,840
You should not talk while eating.

741
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,490
I'm done eating!

742
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,380
T-That.. That girl!

743
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,540
What's up with her?

744
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,680
Sister-in-law...

745
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,570
Are you all right?

746
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,620
Yes?

747
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,570
Please sit down.

748
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,670
It's hard, isn't it?

749
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:50,860
To live as a noblewoman isn't always great.

750
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:56,210
Because there are a lot of things you have to give up for reputation and dignity.

751
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:01,900
To be honest, reputation and dignity don't feed you.

752
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,570
I want to act like a lady too, you know.

753
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,060
But I lived as a peasant since I was very young

754
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,910
I don't even remember being a noble.

755
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:16,110
I know it's hard, but you shouldn't be scorned

756
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,470
because of the past that you and your mother had to endure, should you?

757
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,250
Moreover... You need to consider the man

758
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,930
you are going to get married to.

759
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:32,100
It will be hard, but at least for his sake,

760
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,190
try your best.

761
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,910
The silk will arrive soon.

762
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:39,960
Thanks for your help.

763
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,460
Don't mention it. It's for our family after all.

764
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,330
Is Yeon Ok doing well?

765
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,490
She's well. Take care of yourself.

766
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:51,260
If it gets risky, get yourself out of there first. All right?

767
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,410
Don't worry, Hyeong-nim!

768
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,160
Long time no see!

769
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,030
You  are... ? Hey, hurry and block him.

770
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,030
Get them!

771
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:23,760
He has a no-in*. 
  (A permit issued by government offices for travel and selling)

772
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,270
 Merchant's permit

773
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,150
- Is that it? 
 - Yeah.

774
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:41,420
The Chief of Left Police's seal is on it.

775
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,060
All right.

776
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,860
I will take care of things here. Hurry and take this to the king.

777
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,770
 Exclusive right to trade in cotton at Jemulpo Port, Hanyang,

778
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,290
 1620, 1st lunar month, 14th day 
signed: Chief of Left Police Yi Won Yeop

779
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,940
Imagine that the one backing the smugglers was the chief of the left police bureau.

780
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,250
Yi I Cheom was acting so high and mighty about how upright he was.

781
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,290
But it seems he had a hidden back pocket.

782
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,530
Hypocritical old man.

783
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,730
So how should I settle this situation?

784
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,800
Keep it and use it when I'm driving out Yi I Cheom,

785
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,480
or immediately dismiss the chief of left police bureau from his office?

786
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,460
I will do what you want.

787
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,570
I heard that to capture a commander, you must first shoot his horse.

788
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,870
Since we cannot know what the left state councillor will do when given more time,

789
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,390
I think it will be correct to settle this situation immediately, Your Majesty.

790
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,140
For violating our country's laws

791
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,520
and giving protection to criminal smugglers,

792
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,930
the Chief of Left  Police will be removed from his office!

793
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:04,400
It appears that the left state councillor isn't quite as powerful as he used to be.

794
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,800
After all, he couldn't protect his eldest son.

795
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,890
The evidence is so clear, and as with the banned book from last time,

796
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,410
the left chief of police's mistake is just too great, isn't it?

797
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,730
Even so, before, he would have found some way to avoid this.

798
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:22,290
His excellency the left state councillor is not one to just allow something like this to happen.

799
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,490
So is this your work?

800
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,820
Let me ask you something, too.

801
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:55,350
Did you get me shot by a rifle?

802
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,050
It's a dog-eat-dog world anyway, isn't it?

803
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:03,570
You're trying to kill me even while I'm doing nothing. So I should at least try struggling against it.

804
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,490
What?

805
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,900
You thought I was a mouse you could easily handle,

806
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,490
but now that I've bitten you on the nose, did it surprise you?

807
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,530
Don't expect His Majesty to

808
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,490
protect you indefinitely.

809
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,440
And you, too,

810
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,790
should not expect your power and authority to last forever.

811
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:44,300
Didn't I tell you to forbid the smuggling for the time being?

812
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,090
I meant to do it just once more, because there was a situation with my in-laws, and then...

813
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,880
I told you many times to not be weak before wealth.

814
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,530
Show self-restraint.

815
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,840
I am sorry, Father.

816
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,000
Bring me liquor!

817
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,930
Do they know who I am?

818
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,810
Bring me liquor immediately!

819
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:20,150
My lord, you should return home.

820
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:25,120
What are you doing, not bringing the liquor!

821
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,490
You've worked hard, Hyeong-nim.

822
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:33,550
Imagine that I am benefitting from you people.

823
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,780
- You worked hard. Accept this drink. 
 - Yes.

824
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,400
Look at this man, he is flipping out now that he sees liquor.

825
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,520
Once you get married, it won't be easy to drink like this.

826
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,130
So pour it down now.

827
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,760
- Yes. 
 - Cheers.

828
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,010
How dare he. Does he know who I am?

829
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,030
Is he someone you know?

830
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,070
It's nothing. Let's go.

831
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:25,140
Are you looking down on me too, because I was removed from my position?

832
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,790
I asked you who that man is.

833
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,650
He is the brother-in-law of Kim Dae Seok, who is said to have been the mole at the fabric store.

834
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,880
- Capture him right now. 
 - My lord.

835
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,900
I told you to capture him right now, didn't I?

836
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,580
Please spare me.

837
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,800
Please spare me!

838
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,520
Spare me...

839
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:01,330
You insect! Because of you people ... I was....!

840
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:04,410
Please spare me, my lord, please spare me.

841
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,960
This dirty scum, how dare you!?

842
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,930
My lord, please stop.

843
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,180
Out of my way!

844
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,220
My lord!

845
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,360
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

846
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,000
Chil Seong is dead, they said.

847
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,320
What is going on?

848
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,030
W-well...

849
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,920
Chil Seong is...

850
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,620
He died, they said.

851
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,110
Chil Seong?

852
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,080
Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim!

853
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,140
- Ba Wu.
 - Ba Wu.

854
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,020
Where is Chil Seong?

855
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,290
I asked you, where is Chil Seong?

856
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,300
Over there...

857
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,570
Is he your family member?

858
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,890
My brother-in-law.

859
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:35,000
The chief of police said he saw an unidentified assailant running away holding a sword.

860
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,250
It appears to be that man's doing.

861
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,150
That is a lie!

862
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:45,320
He did it. That man,

863
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,360
someone saw him holding a sword with blood on it.

864
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,070
He said the blood is from his battle with the unidentified assailant.

865
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,690
We will tell you the results of the investigation later, so please leave.

866
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,600
Please return home, my lord.

867
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,820
Let's go, Hyeong-nim.

868
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,590
He was your brother-in-law?

869
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:17,090
An insect happened to bother me,

870
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,250
so I stepped on it.

871
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,130
Out of my way.

872
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,640
That is enough. Back off now.

873
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,960
Are you serious, damn it?

874
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,190
If someone is of a lower class, do they look like insects to you, too?

875
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,670
I told you to back off!

876
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,920
He is my hyeong.

877
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,040
Yes.

878
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,350
We are mortal enemies after all, just as you said.

879
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,990
One of us will have to die

880
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:53,090
for this sickening ill-fated relationship to finally end.

881
01:08:55,070 --> 01:09:02,030

882
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,750
There is no one more beautiful in all eight provinces of Joseon.

883
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:13,020
♫  They say this is how the world is  ♫

884
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,050
♫  But it's not only today that things don't go my way  ♫

885
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,200
 There is one less than when they entered the palace?

886
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,410
 Who dares to hide in the palace after entering among the band of entertainers?

887
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,740
 I must find out.

888
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,800
 What is it that you want?

889
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,030
 Please give up on Kim Dae Seok.

890
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:33,590
 You look like you would actually commit treason if it comes to it.

891
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,660
 When will we see its effects?

892
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,050
 It won't be long.

893
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,790
 Now that His Majesty has collapsed, the world immediately belongs to them.

894
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:46,080
 You must not go. It is the left state councillor's plot to kill you.

895
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,860
 This is the last chance that I am giving you.

896
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,810
 You must return alive.

897
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,220
 Trust in me and wait for me.

898
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:57,650
♫  The stone rolls on  ♫
