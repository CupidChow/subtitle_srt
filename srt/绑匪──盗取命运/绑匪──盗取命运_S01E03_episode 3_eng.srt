1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,700
 Jung Il-woo

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,700
 Kwon Yu-ri

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,630
 Shin Hyun-soo

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,740
 Bossam - Steal the Fate

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Search every corner. They must be found and killed!

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,100

7
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,020
Sister-in-law!

8
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,620
Brother-in-law!

9
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,030
Sister-in-law, are you hurt anywhere?

10
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,380
What are you doing here, Brother-in-law?

11
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,990
Stop.

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,850
So you're the very culprit responsible for this situation.

13
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,460
Brother-in-law!

14
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,300
If you found the one you were looking for, don't draw blood meaninglessly and just go.

15
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,940
From what I can see, rescuing this woman is more important than cutting off my head.

16
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,890
Silence, you knave! At the very least, you're someone I can...

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,400
Yes, this knave ... when I was at the gisaeng house...

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,170
At the gisaeng house?

19
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,650
You treacherous ruffian.

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,910
I thought we were on friendly terms. I guess it's an ill-fated relationship.

21
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,910
Friend?! You're nothing but an insect!

22
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,950
There they are!

23
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,950
Brother-in-law!

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,350
Brother-in-law,  before anyone else gets here ...

25
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,020
Let's go!

26
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,690
- Catch him! 
 - Run!

27
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,300
This way.

28
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,340
Stop. This way, this way. Hurry!

29
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,180
Damn it!

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,480
Please step back.

31
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,340
Brother-in-law...

32
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,790
Sister-in-law!

33
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,920
You must get away first. Now!

34
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,670
- Let's go. 
 - How can I run away by myself?

35
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,190
Then  would you rather stay and put him in harm's way too?

36
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,390
You must run away first before he can also run away or fight, right?!

37
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,940
This man is right. Please get away. Hurry!

38
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,470
I'm fine. So leave me here and get yourself to safety.

39
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,940
That man isn't going to die. He's a nobleman, isn't he?

40
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,760
He's the son of their household, do you think they'll kill him? They can't!

41
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,960
So let's go already!

42
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,300
Ah, damn it all. Hey, you bastards!

43
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,610
Do you know who's the man you're trying to kill?

44
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,020
He's the son of your master.

45
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,050
Think hard. If you kill his son, do you think your master would praise you for it?!

46
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,110
You see that? Those bastards can't touch a hair on his head.

47
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,620
So if you understand now, let's go already!

48
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,640
Please go first. I'll follow close behind!

49
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,170
Hurry! Hurry!

50
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,860
Don't tell me.  Are you the son of His Excellency the left state councillor?

51
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,590
- That's correct. 
 - We came here following his orders.

52
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,790
I went easy on you thinking you were my family servants,

53
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,740
but from the current situation I see it's going to be different from now on.

54
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,300
Only come forward if you want to see blood.

55
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Stop!

56
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,090
You should stop too, Young Master.

57
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,230
What will you do if His Excellency found out?

58
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,510
I'll ignore what happened up to here. So please step aside.

59
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,200
If you'll turn a blind eye, I'll do what I can to change Father's mind.

60
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,770
Unfortunately I cannot do that. Please step aside.

61
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,090
You know well that I don't have a choice either.

62
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,760
If you must go...

63
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,050
cut me down first.

64
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,090
You and Cha Dol can go your way now.

65
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,740
What are you planning to do? Surely you aren't going back, are you?

66
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Do you have a death wish?

67
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,440
Didn't you see how furious your in-laws were to kill you?

68
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,280
It looks like you're worried about your brother-in-law,

69
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,180
but is it time for you to worry about others when you need to worry about yourself first?

70
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,090
You have to get out alive first!

71
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,440
I think my father is right for now.

72
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,110
First, let's go to the palace as planned.

73
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,790
No matter how powerful your father-in-law is,

74
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,560
could he be more powerful than your father, the king?

75
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,980
Once they confirm you're alive, surely everything else will fall into place.

76
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
Let's go first to the Danbong gate of the palace.

77
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,190
Please spare my sister-in-law. I'll convince her to live where no one else can find her.

78
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,740
Just spare her. Your son desperately begs you like this, Father!

79
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,330
That's impossible.

80
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,570
If people later find out that she's alive,

81
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,260
how will you handle the aftermath then?

82
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,310
I will bear the responsibility.

83
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,280
What can you do?

84
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,770
We cannot endanger our family just for your sister-in-law's sake.

85
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,510
Only the dead will keep their lips sealed.

86
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,140
You have made a mistake.

87
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,490
What did you say?

88
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,080
If you will kill my sister-in-law to seal her lips,

89
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,750
how could you not think of the lips of the people you deployed to kill her?

90
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,970
My men's lips are tight. They will guard the secret with their lives.

91
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,310
What is the number of people who witnessed what happened yesterday?

92
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,010
- It's a little over twenty. 
 - When this matter is resolved, kill them all.

93
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,870
- Yes. 
 - Are you satisfied now?

94
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,120
Lock him up in the storeroom.

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,820
Father! Lies beget even bigger lies.

96
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,590
Even if you kill all those men, who will seal the lips of those who killed them?

97
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,790
What are you doing? Take him away!

98
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,110
Will you kill Tae Chul, first Hyeong-nim, and myself as well?!

99
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,760
If we go according to what you say, isn't this the only way to guard that secret?!

100
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,130
Silence! How dare you utter such nonsense in front of Father?!

101
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,770
Did I say anything wrong?

102
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,290
If someone's lips were to slip, and his Majesty the king finds out about this,

103
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,800
don't you know that our family is truly doomed anyway?

104
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,490
Did I not tell you to silence yourself?!

105
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,200
It is still not too late.

106
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,250
Please admit the truth to his majesty and beg for his forgiveness, Father.

107
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,160
This fool won't give up!

108
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,050
Father, Father!

109
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,530
They say a Mandarin orange can change in the right circumstance into an orange tree.

110
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,330
But I suppose an orange tree, even if planted elsewhere, will always produce oranges.

111
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,720
Why were you caught?

112
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,140
Looking at how clean your face is, I guess you're a pretty lover boy.

113
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,220
Were you caught trying to seduce the lady of this home?

114
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,300
Ignore me if I'm wrong. Look...

115
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,130
Look, perhaps this is fate.

116
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,090
Let's introduce ourselves. I'm from Supogyo. The name is Chu— I-I mean,

117
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,350
The name is Dog Crap.

118
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,070
The silent type, huh?

119
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,790
It looks like you don't know much about me.

120
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,160
If anyone in Cheonggaecheon hears the name "Dog Crap",

121
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,110
even the kids who were crying will stop and sweep up the courtyard.

122
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,010
It stops them right in their tracks!

123
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,590
You're excessively quiet. Fine!

124
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:15,200
I won't bother you anymore, so just hear my one request.

125
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,360
Come over here and untie this rope for me.

126
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,060
This rope, just... can't you hear me?!

127
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,080
- You made the right choice. Please untie this rope for me. 
 - Please just shut your mouth!

128
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,630
Orabeoni. Orabeoni! 
   ("Older brother", said by a girl - ancient version of "oppa")

129
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,900
Didn't I tell you to go away?

130
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,680
I'm going to briefly come in.

131
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,290
Please go back, Aunt.

132
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,740
I have something to tell my brother. Move aside.

133
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,810
Do you still not know anything about Father?

134
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,150
It doesn't matter what you say to him.

135
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,530
If you must see him, wait until his wrath has cooled down. Then you can return.

136
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,470
My lady. What happened? Did you meet his excellency?

137
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,050
It's Court Lady Jo. She's unmistakably the one who told Dae Yeop about this.

138
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,820
We don't know what else she may scheme, so have Tae Chul keep a close watch on her.

139
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,580
Hurry back to the palace and make sure to secure the entrances.

140
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,890
Since I've already talked to the Minister of Defense, his staff will cooperate with you.

141
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,550
But since it's the palace gates, there might be eyes watching.

142
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,610
I'll take care of the aftermath.

143
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,490
If you find my daughter-in-law, no matter where it is or who is watching,

144
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,320
you must kill her. Understand?

145
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

146
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,610
Your Highness, are you all right?

147
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,470
I'm fine. So let's keep going.

148
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,340
Let's rest for a bit.

149
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,920
I told you, I'm fine.

150
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,930
I'm saying this because Cha Dol seems to be having a hard time.

151
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh my legs! My poor legs!

152
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,320
Your Highness. Let's please rest for a bit.

153
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,250
Let me see your feet.

154
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,690
It's tolerable so don't worry about me—

155
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,980
How can I not worry about you when I already am? Please give me your feet.

156
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,640
It's blood!

157
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,980
What? Move!

158
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,840
Hey, just sit still for a moment!

159
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,220
What are you doing? Let go of my foot this instant!

160
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,680
- Ah, really! 
 - That's why I told you to let go.

161
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,790
Give me your foot.

162
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,990
Your foot!

163
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,050
Water.

164
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,530
Bandage.

165
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,110
You're not even some young miss,  how can you be this shy?

166
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,690
- Father! 
 - What?

167
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,120
Be quiet and act moderately. Instead of useless talking, get her some shoes.

168
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,170
Hurry up.

169
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,660
I thought he said it was somewhere around here.

170
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,670
Orabeoni.

171
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,850
I heard they are looking for you now.

172
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,690
Did something happen?

173
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,570
I'll talk to you later.

174
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,990
Is there a store selling shoes around here?

175
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,330
Yes. We are on our way from there now.

176
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,090
Isn't this pretty?

177
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,460
Yes, pretty.  Where is it?

178
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,900
- There, if you go around that alley, right— 
 - Thanks.

179
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,760
Don't tell anyone you saw me. Understand?

180
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,260
That's five nyang.

181
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,490
- How much? 
 - Five nyang.

182
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,780
You're a thief.  Does it make sense, such a price for a pair of shoes?

183
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,760
Take it or leave it.  These danghye* are luxury goods, 
  (traditional Korean shoes)

184
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,160
embroidered with the skill and effort of my master, an artisan for the royal family.

185
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,710
An artisan for the royal family?

186
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,700
Yes.  This pair was originally supposed to be worn by Princess Hwa In at her wedding.

187
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,070
Never mind.  Just pretend you didn't hear that.

188
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,860
Her highness the princess?  Are you sure?

189
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,340
- I said leave it if you don't like it. 
 - Who doesn't like it?

190
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,000
- You're giving the socks for free, aren't you? 
 - Why would I do that?

191
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,300
Don't you know "buy one, get one free"?

192
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,130
Fine.

193
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,540
Father.

194
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,120
Try them on.  They will fit.

195
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,900
♫  The whispering sound following the path  ♫

196
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,440
♫  of two steps in unison  ♫

197
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,730
They are really pretty.

198
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,550
Pretty?  Shoes are just shoes.

199
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,210
Hurry and try them on.

200
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,550
♫  flows like the singing stream  ♫

201
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,090
They look so precious, these are expensive.

202
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,890
Precious ...it's not even worth a few cents.

203
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,420
That's not so.  From a glance, a master artisan worked with all his skill—

204
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,080
Hurry and put them on!

205
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,300
♫  That beautiful day  ♫

206
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:50,790
♫  That day spent chasing the clouds  ♫

207
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,590
How can they fit so perfectly?

208
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,350
Thank you.

209
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,100
I know him.  Because the chief gatekeeper knows me,

210
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,860
he will let me into the palace.

211
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,750
What is it now?

212
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,640
I think they are the ones sent to capture you.

213
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,220
Do you see the bamboo staffs in their hands?

214
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,850
This weapon is usually used by ruffians.

215
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,460
There is a knife hidden in the staff.

216
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,330
I'm sure the chief gatekeeper knows what I know.

217
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,530
But he is not driving out the suspicious men.

218
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,020
Doesn't it mean they are working hand in glove with each other?

219
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,410
I think your father-in-law is very powerful.

220
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,260
From the look of it, he has the chief gatekeeper working for him too.

221
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,090
Damn.  It's a mess.

222
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,620
If it's like this at the Danbong Gate,

223
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,680
it's obvious they'll be guarding the other gates as well.

224
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,790
What are you going to do now?

225
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,300
There's one way but I don't know if it will work.

226
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,880
Hurry and go.

227
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,310
At this rate, how will you—

228
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,270
You! Stop that!

229
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,170
- That little rascal! 
 - Kids these days!

230
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,540
- Don't! 
 - Don't!

231
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,900
Go away! You're going to get in trouble!

232
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,630
Hey! Come here!

233
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,800
Once I get my hands on you, you little...

234
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,050
Don't do that!

235
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,750
Father.

236
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,150
What?

237
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,090
Once the princess returns to the palace,

238
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,120
will we never see her again?

239
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,480
That's right.

240
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,230
Anyway, she's at a completely different rank than us and lives in a different place.

241
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,150
Didn't I tell you?

242
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,960
All pretty women are wicked.

243
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,730
Don't be bewitched by her.

244
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,490
Wow...

245
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,450
So pretty...

246
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,130
Be well.

247
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,390
Your Highness too...

248
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,190
Please live a long and happy life.

249
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,000
I will.

250
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,670
You're a new face. Who do you work for?

251
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,290
I'm a maid from Noble Royal Consort Yun's family.

252
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,470
Ah, I see.

253
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,820
I thought you looked older.

254
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,090
Oh right.

255
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,750
I heard that ever since her daughter passed away, Noble Royal Consort Yun has been sick in bed.

256
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,300
She must be suffering from such heartbreak.

257
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,610
Next!

258
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,390
Your badge.

259
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,550
Your badge!

260
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,320
You shouldn't leave this behind.

261
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,270
My badge...

262
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,650
Where did my badge go?

263
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,740
- Have you seen my badge? 
 - I don't know.

264
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,480
Where did my badge go?

265
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,330
Hold it!

266
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,470
Who's the kid?

267
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,020
Who's the kid?

268
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,360
He's a child eunuch, my lord.

269
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,380
So he's neither a boy nor a girl.

270
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,440
But why is he dressed like this?

271
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,450
I don't know exactly,

272
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,950
I heard that he was negligent in his studies, so was being punished for it.

273
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,390
Go.

274
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,770
Next!

275
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,970
Why are you here? What about your father?

276
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,250
I just thought it would be more fun here so I came without him knowing.

277
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,240
It's no problem, right?

278
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,510
Cha Dol! Cha Dol!

279
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,720
Cha Dol! Hey Cha Dol!

280
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,180
Where did that runt go?

281
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,670
Cha Dol. Cha Dol!

282
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,810
Cha Dol, that little rascal!

283
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,190
Just wait until I get my hands on you!

284
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,120
Why are you all like this?

285
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,760
Didn't you all come looking for me because you had something to say to me?

286
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,190
If you have nothing to say, please leave.

287
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,080
What is this?

288
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,110
It is the musk of the roe deer from Saga.

289
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,180
It's a precious item that came from Ming.

290
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,820
His majesty the king hasn't visited my quarters in a long time.

291
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,460
Please take care of this.

292
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,960
I understand.

293
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,220
Anyone else?

294
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,550
It is agarwood, which is more precious than musk.  
  Agarwood is used to make incense and perfume.

295
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,040
I also have a request.

296
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,010
Me too.

297
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,420
What kind of shameless acts are you doing?

298
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,800
Aren't you even embarrassed to behave this way in front of lowly people?

299
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,030
I don't think the person who first offered the musk should be saying that.

300
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,820
I was merely reminded of our dear Court Lady Kim when seeing such a precious item.

301
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,040
It's not a bribe!

302
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,320
If you are going to fight, please do it outside.

303
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,950
Your words sound offensive to me.

304
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,050
Have you no sense of respect?

305
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,990
Ah.

306
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,330
Is that so?

307
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,600
Please forgive my lack of respect to you all, Lady Consorts.

308
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,030
Please take these and go.

309
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,340
I-I mean—

310
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,740
Look here, Court Lady Kim.

311
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,990
I think there must be a misunderstanding—

312
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,850
What's wrong?

313
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,090
It's my brother-in-law.

314
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,120
Brother-in-law?

315
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,760
What kind of position does your brother-in-law have, to be over there?

316
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,000
He is the chief of police, so he can go anywhere.

317
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,800
The chief of police? He almost caught me.

318
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,620
Why are you here? What happened to the laundry?

319
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,900
I had business to attend to.

320
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,150
But where were you going?

321
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,150
I was on my way to take the laundry to Yanghwadang Hall.

322
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,940
How fortunate!

323
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,900
I'm sorry, but could you do me a favor?

324
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,000
What kind... of favor?

325
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,830
Stop.

326
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,460
Pass.

327
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,820
Court Lady Kim!

328
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,830
Can you deliver this to Court Lady Han

329
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,640
and ask her to meet me at the Aeryeonjeong Pavilion in the Huwon Garden?

330
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,970
I request this of you.

331
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,990
 The Huwon Garden was used by the royal family and is known today as The Secret Garden.

332
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,460
Someone is coming from there.

333
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,840
It's been a while since I've seen you, Princess.

334
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,300
You...

335
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,750
Have you been happy and peaceful thus far, Princess?

336
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,920
I guess my mother doesn't know that I'm here.

337
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,950
You were intelligent when you were younger. You are still wise.

338
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,510
I see you have partnered with my father-in-law.

339
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,980
The left state councillor did request this, but I did not partner with him.

340
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,250
I am always in his majesty's service.

341
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,150
But why... are you doing this?

342
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,250
The fact that Your Highness is alive...

343
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,610
will be troublesome for the king.

344
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,070
Did you say "troublesome"?

345
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,350
Yes. It will be troublesome.

346
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,490
If the fact that you are alive

347
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:09,330
were known by his majesty, have you thought about what would happen?

348
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,590
Since his excellency has committed the crime of creating an illusion which deceived the king,

349
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,490
and since he tried to kill his precious daughter,

350
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,750
wouldn't this be treason?

351
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,540
Of course the Westerners and Southerners will make use of this opportunity.

352
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,840
Since they lost to the Northerners before.

353
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,070
It won't just be the left state councillor and his family,

354
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,430
but the whole  northern faction that will be wiped.

355
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,620
But who is His Excellency?

356
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,380
Joseon's most powerful man.

357
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,540
He is renowned as the leader of the Northerners and most of the government officials are his people.

358
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,090
He's definitely not someone who will just bear it silently.

359
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:56,480
Perhaps... a true revolt will occur.

360
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:05,770
Will you be able to handle all of this, Your Highness?

361
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,030
Please die, Your Highness.

362
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:33,150
This is the only path through which the well-being of the king and the Jongmyo shrine  can be assured.

363
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:40,080
I am saying this without an ulterior motive, only to save his majesty.

364
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,690
You must believe me.

365
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,510
 Jongmyo Shrine - Confucian shrine for the dead Joseon kings and queens.

366
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,410
Is that you, Gae Si?

367
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,930
Your Majesty!

368
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,140
What are you doing here so late?

369
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,210
Who exactly are these people?

370
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,230
They are launderers.

371
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,080
I've called a new launderer to request something.

372
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,940
Raise your head.

373
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,150
He said to raise your head.

374
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,050
What are you doing not raising your head?

375
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,720
Your Majesty, why are you trying to see the face of a lowly woman?

376
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,450
Please take it back.

377
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,780
I'm going to Buyongji*.  Follow me. 
 (Pond)

378
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

379
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,080
Father...

380
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,080
What do you think about the left state councillor?

381
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,080
Did you say the left state councillor, Your Majesty?

382
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,660
Why are you so surprised? Did something happen without my knowledge?

383
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,920
No, Your Majesty.

384
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,120
How can I possibly hide anything from you?

385
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,190
Those are utterly unreasonable words.

386
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,160
Gae Si.

387
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,620
Surely, you're on my side, aren't you?

388
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,390
Why is there no response?

389
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,540
Since the first time I met you at the Eastern Palace, when you were crown prince,

390
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,190
I have been devoted to you.

391
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,320
Please believe in my loyalty, Your Majesty.

392
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,150
I understand.

393
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,920
If you say so, it must be.

394
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,190
Wasn't the pledge different? If you didn't want to dirty your hands,

395
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,120
you should have locked her up and waited for me!

396
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,060
Didn't I tell you that I didn't have a chance to do that?

397
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,560
Ever since the late king ate the yakbap* and died of poisoning,
 (sweet dish with glutinous rice, chestnuts, jujubes and pine nuts)

398
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,380
I thought that we were on the same boat.

399
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,530
Do you perhaps have other motives?

400
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,560
If that had been the case, the palace guards would've been here to arrest you.

401
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,510
And did you not say that you wouldn't mention that ever again?

402
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,980
Am I the only one who is afraid of the future trouble?

403
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,260
I'm sorry. I had a slip of the tongue because of my hastiness.

404
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,150
It seems that you are mistaken, but I am not your subordinate.

405
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,600
- Do you understand? 
- I understand.

406
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,500
Please calm down, Court Lady Kim.

407
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,560
I will make sure to repay the debt to your mother's second husband.

408
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,160
But what about the court lady who has met Princess Hwa In?

409
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,910
I already bid them to get rid of her.

410
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,750
Did she happen to mention where the princess was going?

411
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,120
You are very pitiful.

412
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,960
Would someone who is being pursued tell anyone their destination?

413
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,880
Seeing that you are speaking such senseless words today,

414
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,300
it seems that you have a sense of urgency.

415
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,890
Since I have appointed someone to follow her,

416
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,830
you must not lose her and must get rid of her properly this time.

417
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,720
You know very well that there are many unseen eyes and ears inside the palace.

418
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,990
You must quickly handle it before his majesty finds out.

419
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,630
Jung Yeong.

420
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

421
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,320
- I'll order them to back away. 
 - No. Follow me.

422
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,960
Find Hwa In.

423
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

424
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,090
Once you find Hwa In,

425
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,690
secretly keep a close eye on the left state councillor.

426
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,730
If he kills Princess Hwa In,

427
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,160
bring that evidence to me.

428
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,030
Cha Dol.

429
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,410
Hyeong?

430
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,140
What are you?

431
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,860
 Palace Eunuch

432
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,980
What is this?  You're a eunuch?

433
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,860
Hey, Cha Dol!

434
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,790
This rotten boy!

435
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,900
I did wrong.

436
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,920
- I could just! 
 - Father.

437
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,540
- Go away. 
 - Father ...

438
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,620
Ah, go away!

439
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,030
Are you not going to ask what happened?

440
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,600
If things had gone well, you wouldn't have come out of the palace.

441
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,760
It was a complete failure.

442
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,860
For now, let's run.

443
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,560
- Again? 
 - Yes, you rascal.

444
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,260
Let's go home.

445
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,270
That's why I asked you to release this rope. This is because I wasn't able to defecate for the past few days.

446
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,460
At my age, I can't even go in my pants.

447
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,980
Young Master.

448
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,980
Young Master.

449
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,020
Court Lady Jo!

450
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,340
These noblemen have no sense. Don't you know that if it goes thump, it's the sound of a pumpkin falling?

451
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,000
She came secretly. Secretly!

452
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,540
Young Master, what happened?

453
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,800
Have you seen the princess?

454
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,630
Yes, she's alive.

455
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,860
Gods of heaven and earth, thank you!

456
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,340
Don't worry. I will surely rescue her.

457
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,810
Is Ba Wu also alive?

458
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,420
How do you know Ba Wu? Who are you?

459
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,390
He's of the same party as the thief who took the princess away.

460
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,830
Tell me exactly where he is.

461
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,420
Or I will...!

462
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,090
Ah, spare me!

463
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,970
Spare me, my lord.

464
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,920
If you want to live, tell me where he might have gone.

465
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,970
He would be at the giseng house.

466
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,500
I already searched there.

467
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,760
Then it's Gongju.

468
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,240
Gongju?

469
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,090
I remember that I heard him say that his mother and sister live in Gongju.

470
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,220
 Let's exchange names. I am Yi Dae Yeop who lives in Jaedong.

471
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,000
 I am Kim Dae Seok from Cheonan.

472
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,070
Where in Gongju?

473
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,110
I don't really know because he said it when I was under the influence of alcohol.

474
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,940
Slaves. He just mentioned they are from the slave class.

475
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,490
Ah, just wait a minute. Wait a minute! If you just search Gongju, you will find the answer...

476
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,500
Why would I lie to you?

477
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,800
Please spare me!

478
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,410
If in fact it was a lie, you will think it is better to die.

479
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:17,330
Until we find out whether what he said was true, don't give him any water.

480
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,870
Yes, Your Excellency.

481
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,120
What a dunce you are!

482
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,970
Are you going to give that to Dae Yeop?

483
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,550
Ah, yes...

484
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,780
Prepare it again and give it to him.

485
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,170
Yes, Your Excellency.

486
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,420
I understand my daughter-in-law's maternal family's home is in Anseong.

487
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,130
You should also know where her maternal grandmother's home is. Isn't that right?

488
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,110
We are sleeping here tonight?

489
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,860
Yes. Even if it's uncomfortable, we will sleep here tonight.

490
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,570
Tomorrow we will go out of the town.

491
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,790
Oh my!

492
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,790
What a surprise...!

493
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,240
You, really ...

494
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,910
The blood on his head hasn't dried yet and he's fooling around! 
   That is, he is a newborn infant.

495
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,910
I heard that you and mom also met at the watermill.

496
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,690
- Who said that? 
 - Uncle Chun Bae.

497
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,930
Argh, that old man. He's ruining this kid.

498
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,260
Do you want to eat?

499
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,150
Here.

500
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,770
Here.

501
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,760
You would even extract and eat the bean sprouts out of a beggar's butt hole!

502
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,800
Tae Chul is scary, but I'm a pushover?

503
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,320
No, that's not it.

504
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,600
Isn't someone who gives and steals worse than someone who doesn't give at all ... Sir?

505
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,150
How about it? Will you do a deal with me?

506
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,080
A deal...

507
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,170
I don't know if there's any alcohol remaining... I'm thirsty.

508
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,070
Ah, it's great!

509
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,990
I feel I can live now.

510
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,430
Now, tell me.

511
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,640
Where do you think he hid?

512
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:33,420
If I tell you, will you secretly deal with Ba Wu and only rescue your sister-in-law?

513
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,580
I don't even know. And even if I knew, I can't say a word.

514
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,920
What kind of loyalty do you have towards someone who won't even come to save you?

515
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,830
Didn't you say you wanted to live? Shouldn't you save yourself first?

516
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,890
That's his fate.

517
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,610
I have my own problems, so why should I be concerned about someone else's?

518
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,920
And also,

519
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:05,960
I think the loyalty for those nobles seems to be a bit different

520
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,560
from what people like us call loyalty.

521
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,680
Loyalty is the same for everyone. What are you saying is different?

522
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,760
Ba Wu is not blind like a fire moth.

523
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,200
He will die for sure if he comes here. That's loyalty for you?

524
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,720
I don't expect this kind of things.

525
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,560
If that rascal, after my death, while swilling down alcohol,

526
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,730
throws food on the ground as an offering to the spirits for me,

527
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,990
I'm good with that. That's loyalty to me.

528
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,590
Ah, I'm so hungry.

529
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,970
A sigh... the ground is going to cave in.

530
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,990
Do you have anywhere to go outside the town?

531
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,890
Well, I guess you can't go to your parents' house.

532
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,600
Well, you must have relatives on your mother's side.

533
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,950
Don't you have any maternal uncles or aunts?

534
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,630
If your mother's family concerns you, what about your maternal grandmother's family?

535
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,780
Even if it's distant relatives, you must have someone.

536
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,610
Did they sew her mouth closed?

537
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,910
- Why isn't she talking...?
 - I'm going to go out for some air.

538
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,340
I only asked you that so I'll take you where you want to go...

539
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,430
Why didn't she say "How insolent"?

540
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,180
It's weird, right, Father?

541
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,240
I don't know.

542
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,390
Father... can't we live with her?

543
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,660
No!

544
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,360
Why...?

545
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,910
Everyone's eyes are deep red trying to capture her.

546
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,120
Are you crazy? She's a headache. A headache.

547
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,530
But still, she's pitiful. She has nowhere to go...

548
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:01,150
In the palace she met a strange lady, who was either a gae si ("lady") or gae-dung ("dog poop")

549
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,570
She told her to die.

550
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,730
Die? Why?

551
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,190
They were talking about some treason.

552
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,850
She told her to die for the king's sake.

553
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:18,240
She saw the king, but the princess didn't even acknowledge him.

554
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,660
Maybe she's been bewitched by that weird lady.

555
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,550
But... it seems as if the king also pretended to ignore her.

556
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,160
What do you mean? You are saying that he saw his own daughter and ignored her?

557
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,510
Yes. I definitely saw it.

558
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:42,130
When the princess' eyes met his, the king's eyes were like ...

559
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,010
Stop saying senseless things. Go sleep!

560
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,000
Definitely they went... like that.

561
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,980
 Raise your head.

562
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,090
 I'm going to Buyongji (Pond). Follow me.

563
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,360
 Yes, Your Majesty.

564
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,950
Did you make sure to guard everything up to the Bukso Gate?

565
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,810
Yes. I made sure to put guards at every gate that leads out of the city.

566
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,550
But, if the princess' maternal home is in Anseong, her maternal grandmother's home is in Cheongju,

567
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,460
and that man's hometown in Gongju, they will head south.

568
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,970
Wouldn't it be enough if we just block Mapo Dock, Seodae Gate, Seoso Gate and  Namdae Gate?

569
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:06,720
Do you mean why did I uselessly say to block all the way to Bukso Gate?

570
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,540
No, that was not what I meant.

571
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,890
Is there any rule that says he can't think as you would?

572
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:17,770
I'm asking if there is any guarantee that he would only move as we expect him to.

573
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,340
Forgive me. I was short-sighted.

574
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,910
He was the one who was able to bossam the princess.

575
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:28,100
Why can't you understand that moving in a hurry could land us in even greater trouble?

576
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,660
She may not have been able to change clothes yet.

577
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,280
Have them keep an eye out for a woman in mourning clothes.

578
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,670
I have already ordered that they look out for a woman in mourning clothes.

579
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,120
If she shows up anywhere, they will kill her on the spot.

580
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,780
Wait.

581
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,050
Stay right there.

582
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,950
Grab her!

583
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:26,810
That's so awesome! Isn't it, Your Highness?

584
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,050
Let's now part ways.

585
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,670
F-father!

586
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:39,920
We're going this way. So you can either go this way or go back. You decide.

587
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,180
No! If you don't go with her highness, I'm not going either!

588
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,260
Come here.

589
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,690
Father! I'm not going!

590
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,610
Father! Let's go with her highness!

591
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,830
I'm not going--

592
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,090
Let's go with her highness!

593
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,960
Father!

594
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,270
Safe travels.

595
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:08,750
I pray that you grow without any problem.

596
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,960
Go with her highness!

597
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,360
Father!

598
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,860
I said let's go with her highness!

599
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,710
How could you leave her like that?!

600
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,130
- Won't you stop crying?! 
 - I'm not going without her!

601
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,090
I said let's go together with her!

602
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,720
Come here!

603
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,150
I'm not going!

604
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,680
 The fact that Your Highness is alive

605
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,010
 will be trouble to his majesty, the king.

606
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,020
 It won't just be the left state councillor and his family,

607
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,770
 but he will also try to annihilate the northern faction.

608
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,960
 Perhaps ...  a true revolt will happen.

609
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,240
 Can you bear the responsibility for all of this, Your Highness?

610
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,260
♫  I can't return to those days  ♫

611
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,360

We have to go with her highness!

615
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,550
Won't you stay still?!

616
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:28,780
We have to go together. I'm not going!

617
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,550
 Please die, Your Highness.

618
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:45,420
♫  I haven't heard from him  ♫

619

 Royal Father. Royal Mother.

622

632
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:07,790
If you don't want to follow me, do whatever you want, kid!

633
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,440
If her highness dies, will it be fine with you?

634
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,700
♫  I can't return to those days again  ♫

635
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,760
Does it really not matter if she dies?!

636
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,330
Are you really not going to go back?

637
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:31,350
Fine, I'm going back to her highness, so you do whatever you want!

638
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:38,410
♫  Again on the edge of fate  ♫

639
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:42,130
♫  I can't return again to those days   ♫

640
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,860
Damn it all.

641
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,090
Hey, Son!

642
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:54,010
♫  which brilliantly shone a long time ago  ♫

643
01:01:55,060 --> 01:02:02,580
♫  I can't return to those days again  ♫

644
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:19,400
♫  The wind is blowing again.  ♫

645
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,370
No!

646
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,980

647
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:32,510
 Please die, Your Highness.

648
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,610
 If her highness dies, is it fine with you?

649
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,860
 They're so pretty. Thank you.

650
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,310
♫  Just for one day ♫

651
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:43,250
 Bossam - Steal the Fate
 Preview

652
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,160
 I'm telling you to start living for yourself!

653
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,880
 What are you saying I should live for?

654
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,170
 Who needs a reason to live?

655
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,630
 I'm no longer the princess.

656
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,880
 I will live as a commoner.

657
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,090
 But if you get caught by your pursuers,

658
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:58,690
 However, I have no intention of saving my niece-in-law at the expense of your life.

659
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:02,560
  We're the only ones left for each other. At least, I can be your lookout.

660
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,720
 It's a thief!

661
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,630
 Why are you going this far?

662
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,630
 I'm a dead person, just like you.

663
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:09,860
 Weren't you the one who brought me here

664
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,760
 It's not too late to die now!

665
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,870
 Her shoes are here.

666
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,190
 Your Highness!

667
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,860
 - Have you found her? 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

668
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,050
 Let the news leak to the left state councillor.
