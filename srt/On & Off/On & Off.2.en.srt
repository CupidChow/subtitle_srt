1
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,362
The person who held me all night like in a dream is gone,

2
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,405
and only the cold air’s left.

3
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,627
[Lee Joo-won]

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,418
You’re not gonna pick up?

5
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,003
Huh?

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,467
It’s nothing.

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,885
You can take it later.

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,226
The switch flips on.

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,438
Last night, I was off.

10
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,818
Pretty sure I just saw it turn off for a second.

11
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,454
Good morning.

12
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,436
Lee Hayoon.

13
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,478
Yes, Ms. Kwon.

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,898
The analysis I told you to redo yesterday.

15
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,860
Is this the best you've got?

16
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,485
Ah—

17
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,530
I fixed that part like you said…

18
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,076
This number.

19
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,161
Where’d you get it?

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,125
It’s not the same as the data I gave you.

21
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,003
How could you just rewrite it yourself like this?

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,547
Well, I just—

23
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,257
Comparing it to other data,

24
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,675
this number seemed more convincing—

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,181
Convincing?

26
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,809
And who trusts your judgment, Lee Hayoon?

27
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,394
Just do what you’re told.

28
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,902
Must've had a rough night?

29
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,695
Explains this mess.

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,949
I’m sorry.

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,704
If you’re sorry, redo it.

32
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,956
Before lunch.

33
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,338
One word—and the person from last night is gone.

34
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,090
And in her place,

35
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,759
only my boss remains.

36
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:01,931
[1 Year Ago]

37
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
Um, Ms. Kwon.

38
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,862
Thank you.

39
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,367
Ugh, the department head’s the worst.

40
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,786
If that happens again,

41
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,539
just say you can’t drink.

42
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,206
Don’t get dragged into it.

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,257
You okay, Lee Hayoon?

44
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,304
Your scent, Ms. Kwon...

45
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,682
it's really nice.

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,353
A very warm scent.

47
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,222
Ms. Kwon.

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,226
Wanna start dating me? From today?

49
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:37,402
I really like you.

50
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,496
What’s your address?

51
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,289
I’ll take you home.

52
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,065
We should talk.

53
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,248
Ms. Kwon.

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,541
I…

55
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,045
About that night—I’m truly sorry.

56
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,257
I was too drunk and messed up.

57
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,842
Please forget it.

58
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,929
So you do remember.

59
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,556
It wasn’t just drunk talk?

60
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,519
I remember everything.

61
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,690
Which makes me even sorrier.

62
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,068
So?

63
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,030
What’s your answer?

64
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:07,992
Huh?

65
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,202
To what?

66
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,998
About dating me.

67
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,251
Is the offer still good?

68
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,722
Or was it just drunken nonsense?

69
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,724
Ah… I…

70
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,393
I just thought...

71
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,936
that you had completely

72
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,981
ignored it.

73
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,942
Stop messing with my head.

74
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,860
Are we doing this or not?

75
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,280
I’m a busy person, too.

76
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,242
I want to.

77
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,748
I want to date you, Ms. Kwon.

78
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,585
I mean it.

79
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,344
[Present]

80
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,891
Knew I’d find you here.

81
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,313
I’m sorry.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,443
For what?

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,572
For not doing my job right.

84
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,710
Was I too harsh this morning?

85
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,385
You think this is funny?

86
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,641
Being all over me at night,

87
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,396
then making me look like a fool in front of everyone in the morning?

88
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,815
That’s not it.

89
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,317
Then what is it?

90
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,278
When you feel like it, I’m your girlfriend—

91
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,364
and when you don’t, I’m just your subordinate?

92
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,992
Watch it, Lee Hayoon.

93
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,452
This is work.

94
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,789
Right. Work.

95
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,458
The perfect excuse

96
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,211
to hurt me.

97
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,510
Can’t answer, can you?

98
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,430
I just…

99
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,266
I just really want to know

100
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,020
what I am to you.

101
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,106
So what do you want me to do?

102
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,858
Huh?

103
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,152
Smile at you in the office?

104
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,694
Be sweet to you here?

105
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:51,113
And if people start talking about us?

106
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,408
Then what?

107
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,409
What can you handle?

108
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,877
I’m going crazy, too!

109
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
I’m sorry.

110
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,326
I'm sorry for everything, Hayoon.

111
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,291
I know your apology is sincere.

112
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,501
But…

113
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,252
this anxiety is real too.
