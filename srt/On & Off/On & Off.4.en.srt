1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,427
Look at the state of you, Kwon Sea.

2
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:16,224
The person who used to be so great,

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,809
falling apart like this

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,603
over a single rookie.

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,985
You're helpless without me, aren't you?

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,530
Everything you have right now,

7
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:32,990
who do you think you have to thank for it?

8
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,545
At the board presentation today,

9
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,340
why didn't you say anything?

10
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,012
We did it together.

11
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,724
Everyone thinks you did it all by yourself.

12
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,519
The results were good. What's the issue?

13
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,688
What's the issue?

14
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,521
It was my idea!

15
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,481
The data I worked on all night.

16
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:08,777
So?

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,320
Did I submit it with only my name and leave yours out?

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,030
I didn't, did I?

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,121
Get real, Sea.

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,414
Sure, it was your idea.

21
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,376
But I'm the one who pitched it in the room,

22
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,545
the one who got the execs on board.

23
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:29,755
All you do is freeze up in front of people.

24
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,425
That was because I was nervous...

25
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,927
Exactly.

26
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,054
That's why I did it.

27
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,306
We're a team, aren't we?

28
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:39,932
Huh?

29
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,394
We're supposed to cover for each other.

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,355
Does that feel so unfair to you?

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,650
This isn't a team.

32
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,237
You're just using my work as if it's your own.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,322
So?

34
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,284
What are you going to do about it?

35
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,869
Go and tell everyone?

36
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,079
Who do you think is going to believe you?

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,456
Me, the one who presents so well,

38
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,958
or you, the one who just mumbles

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,376
in the corner?

40
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,505
Let's break up.

41
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,597
I can't do this with you anymore.

42
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,809
Fine.

43
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,436
Have it your way.

44
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,898
But just remember this.

45
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,650
Without me? You’re nothing.

46
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,402
The only person here who saw your talent...

47
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:34,862
...was me.

48
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,889
Why that face?

49
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,730
You haven't changed a bit.

50
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,942
Always playing the victim.

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,277
What do you want?

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,661
You.

53
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,085
I came to take back what's mine.

54
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,670
You're insane.

55
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,673
Why?

56
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,635
After I was transferred to K-Strategy headquarters

57
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,847
and came back to Korea,

58
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,889
I started hearing things about you.

59
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,809
Still doing well.

60
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,436
Still beautiful.

61
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,527
But seeing someone else by your side...

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,362
that kind of bothers me.

63
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,324
Don't you dare touch Hayoon.

64
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,536
Touch her?

65
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,206
I'm just telling her the truth.

66
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,543
That without me, you're nothing.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
That girl deserves to know, too,

68
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,880
what kind of person she's with.

69
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,637
Come back to me, Sea.

70
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,601
This time...

71
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,269
I'll make you the absolute best.

72
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,273
I have the power to do it now.

73
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,902
Fine.

74
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,447
You're right.

75
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,327
I always ran away.

76
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,289
Because I was scared of getting hurt.

77
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,126
But not anymore.

78
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,670
What?

79
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,423
It wasn’t my career I was scared of losing.

80
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,259
It was Hayoon.

81
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,304
Losing her the same way

82
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,639
I lost you—

83
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,264
that’s what terrified me.

84
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,898
But thanks to you, I know for sure now.

85
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,119
The original Project NOA proposal.

86
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,496
You told Hayoon to get it from me, didn't you?

87
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:33,041
Using a job offer as bait.

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,755
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,760
Now it's my turn

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,221
to really be the one to leave you, Juwon.

91
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,684
This isn’t about me anymore.

92
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,521
This is for Hayoon. All of it.

93
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,873
Oh my god.

94
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,083
Did you see the article on K-Strategy?

95
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,795
Director Lee Juwon from the new business team...

96
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,880
was caught trying to steal key technology from a competitor,

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,300
and now there's an internal audit.

98
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:24,675
Whoa, seriously?

99
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,385
Isn't she from our company?

100
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,554
I heard she was close with Ms. Kwon...

[Resignation Letter]

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,333
Lee Hayoon.

103
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,710
Can we talk for a minute?

104
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:29,949
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,454
For what?

106
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:36,998
For everything.

107
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,295
For hurting you,

108
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,215
for being a coward and hiding,

109
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,552
and for that recording.

110
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,434
What I said was true.

111
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,019
Those were my words.

112
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,065
But I felt like I had to.

113
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,943
To get Juwon away from you,

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,028
I thought I had to make it seem like

115
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,655
you meant nothing to me.

116
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,578
I mistakenly thought that was the only way...

117
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,581
to protect you.

118
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,376
Just like my old self.

119
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,337
So what?

120
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,048
Does using me as a shield in your past drama

121
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,844
make it okay?

122
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,225
To you, I was always that person, wasn't I?

123
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,686
Someone to be protected, to be hidden,

124
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,064
someone weak who could be tossed aside anytime.

125
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,150
No.

126
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,652
You're not weak.

127
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,904
I'm the weak one.

[Resignation Letter]

129
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,135
What is this?

130
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,721
You were right.

131
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,019
In this company, with my "Team Leader" title,

132
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,520
the career I've built...

133
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,230
I hid behind all that crap and only hurt you.

134
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,527
So I'm done with it.

135
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,195
I thought that without it, maybe

136
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,363
I could be a little more honest with you.

137
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,204
You can take this company from me,

138
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,039
you can take the title away, I don't care.

139
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,125
But I can't lose you. Lee Hayoon.

140
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,128
You’re the one thing I can’t let go of.

141
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,969
She's always like this.

142
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,639
She stabs you where it hurts the most,

143
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,641
then soothes the deepest wound.

144
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,578
You fool...
