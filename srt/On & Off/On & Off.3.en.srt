1
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,798
You worked hard today, Lee Hayoon.

2
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:09,800
Should we get something nice for dinner?

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:10,635
My treat.

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,429
Really?

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,639
Hmm…

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,224
I think this tteokbokki is the best thing I could have right now.

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,978
Because I'm eating it with you, Ms. Kwon.

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,606
You and your words...

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,960
Who's this?

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,128
Someone from work?

11
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,222
ANC Planning Team?

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,976
Isn't that your old company, Ms. Kwon?

13
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,335
What's wrong?

14
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,798
It's nothing.

15
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,625
Hello, Hayoon.

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,545
This is Lee Juwon. I used to work with Team Leader Kwon Sea at ANC.

17
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:13,717
I'm reaching out because I've heard many good things about your recent work.

18
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,813
Ms. Kwon.

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,318
Do you happen to know someone named Lee Juwon?

20
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,322
She used to be at ANC.

21
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,619
How do you know her?

22
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,204
Who is she?

23
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,085
What was she to you?

24
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,963
Hayoon, don't engage with her.

25
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,842
Absolutely just... block her.

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,135
I'll explain everything when we meet tomorrow.

27
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,097
For now, just don't ask anything.

28
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:12,858
Always hiding things from me like this.

29
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,121
Hello, Director Lee Juwon.

30
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,664
I've heard about you from Ms. Kwon.

31
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,083
Oh, really?

32
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,085
Sea talked about me?

33
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:32,753
How interesting.

34
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,298
If you have time tomorrow, should we meet for a bit?

35
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,509
I feel like we have a lot to talk about.

36
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,219
Yes, that sounds good.

37
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,677
Seeing you in person, I get it now.

38
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,054
Why Sea is going to such lengths.

39
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,186
What do you mean by that?

40
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,034
I have a favor to ask you, Hayoon.

41
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,750
Does Sea still have the original proposal

42
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,668
she wrote three years ago?

43
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:57,380
She had a habit of backing things up on a cloud server.

44
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,217
Specifically, Project NOA.

45
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:07,349
Are you asking me to find that for you right now?

46
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,351
It seems to fit well with a new business

47
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,228
I'm planning.

48
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,855
Of course, I'll make it well worth your while.

49
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,523
How about double your current salary?

50
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,237
Why would I do something like that?

51
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,822
Isn't that Ms. Kwon's idea?

52
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,201
You could just ask her for it yourself.

53
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,623
Oh, you're so naive.

54
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,668
We're not exactly on those terms right now.

55
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,262
That's the look of someone who isn't interested.

56
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,271
So what moves you isn't money or position,

57
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,231
but emotion, I take it.

58
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,235
To be more specific...

59
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,945
Kwon Sea.

60
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,153
Am I right?

61
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,579
I thought so.

62
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,375
You're similar to Sea in that way.

63
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,293
Can't stand not knowing something,

64
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,713
and have to face it head-on to feel satisfied.

65
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,262
You and Ms. Kwon...

66
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,097
what were you two to each other?

67
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:40,608
We were more than just colleagues.

68
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,989
Just like Sea is with you now.

69
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,492
Past tense.

70
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,873
Is it?

71
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,668
I don't think we ever ended.

72
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,463
Sea is trapped in a trauma of her own making.

73
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,050
She hasn't been able to take a single step forward.

74
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,222
By any chance...

75
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,974
isn't Sea like that with you, too?

76
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,561
At night, she acts like you're her whole world,

77
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,731
but come morning, it's awkward formalities

78
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,360
and a cold expression, drawing a line.

79
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,695
And in front of others, she's intentionally harsher.

80
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,947
Am I right?

81
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,789
She was the same with me.

82
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,376
That's Kwon Sea's way.

83
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,295
It's a defensive wall she builds not to protect the one she loves,

84
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,425
but to keep herself from getting hurt.

85
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,014
A very, very selfish and cowardly way.

86
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,309
That's because... she's trying to protect me...

87
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,436
Protect you?

88
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:06,277
Back at ANC, when our relationship was almost exposed,

89
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,320
Sea was terrified that everything she'd built

90
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,489
would come crashing down.

91
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,368
So in the end, she abandoned me.

92
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,414
All while making the very plausible excuse

93
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,707
that it was "for us."

94
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,466
Sea doesn't love you, Hayoon.

95
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,886
She's just using you

96
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,806
to find comfort for her own wounded past.

97
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,775
Think about my offer again carefully.

98
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,529
Whether you'll remain in Sea's past or...

99
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,033
you'll come into my future.

100
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:34,698
Hayoon.

101
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,493
You didn't even come to work. Where have you been?

102
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,287
Why weren't you answering your phone?

103
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,288
I was worried all day.

104
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,045
I was doing exactly what you were worried about.

105
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,213
What?

106
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,759
I met with Lee Juwon today.

107
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,096
I told you not to engage with her.

108
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,059
Now I get it.

109
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,894
Why you were always so intent on

110
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,770
drawing a line and pushing me away.

111
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,481
No.

112
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,149
It's a misunderstanding. I can explain everything.

113
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,778
A misunderstanding?

114
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:15,448
But you treat me the exact same way you treated her!

115
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,328
Acting like we're worse than strangers at work,

116
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,082
then pretending to be lovers when we're alone.

117
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,001
Is this also your way of "protecting" me?

118
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,756
Or is it just...

119
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,382
because of your trauma?

120
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,846
Are you scared the same thing will happen with me,

121
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,432
just like how you broke up with Lee Juwon?

122
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,811
That I'll end up just like her,

123
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,146
tarnishing your career and getting in your way?

124
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,399
No.

125
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,068
No, Hayoon.

126
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,819
You're different from her.

127
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,073
How am I different?

128
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,242
Tell me how I'm different!

129
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,454
In the end, to you, I was never...

130
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:05,789
someone you could trust

131
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:07,583
and open up to about everything, was I?

132
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,881
Just a child who has to be handled gently

133
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,510
so I don't trigger your past trauma.

134
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,180
Not a person standing by your side,

135
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,100
but a doll to soothe your own anxiety.

136
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,020
Was that it?

137
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,021
Please...

138
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,277
don't wrap it up in the excuse of protecting me.

139
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,070
So, to you, I'm just...

140
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,198
a subordinate you're a little concerned about.

141
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,908
Is that all?

142
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,659
What?

143
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,081
[Last Night]

144
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:03,972
It's been a while, Lee Juwon.

145
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,766
Well, if it isn't Kwon Sea.

146
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,476
What's up?

147
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,648
I heard you contacted Lee Hayoon.

148
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,108
Don't mess with her.

149
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,110
Mess with her?

150
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,987
What are you talking about?

151
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,614
I just thought she was a cute junior.

152
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,493
Why are you being so sensitive? It's not like you.

153
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,329
What, is she your girlfriend or something?

154
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,042
Don't be ridiculous.

155
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,128
Lee Hayoon is just a member of my team.

156
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,716
Nothing more and nothing less than my subordinate.

157
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,096
So stay away from her.

158
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,064
"Lee Hayoon is just a member of my team."

159
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,024
"A subordinate who's a bit on my mind."

160
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,403
"Nothing more and nothing less."

161
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,413
What are you going to do, Hayoon?

162
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,625
The person you trusted so much...

163
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,335
turns out to think of you as

164
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
nothing more than this behind your back.

165
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,516
You can't answer.

166
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,103
Now I know.

167
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,730
Exactly what I mean to you.

168
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,190
No...

169
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,484
Wait, Hayoon, just a second.

170
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,570
Please, just listen to me, okay?

171
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,786
What more is there to say now?

172
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,976
What do you want?

173
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,313
What's with your voice?

174
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,483
You sound terrible.

175
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
Should we see each other tomorrow?
