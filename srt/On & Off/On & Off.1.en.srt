1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,965
Yes, hello?

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,847
Yes, right.

3
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,128
It made me wonder if she was the same person from last night.

4
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:48,090
She was in perfect Team Leader mode.

5
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,550
Am I the only one who hasn't snapped back to reality?

6
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,346
Yes, Mr. Park.

7
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,681
Let's go with Plan A.

8
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,724
If any issues come up, contact me immediately.

9
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,480
That look in her eyes...

10
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,856
Several times a day,

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,775
it lifts a person up and brings them down.

12
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,896
Ms. Lee Hayoon.

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,481
Do you have a moment?

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,527
Yes, Ms. Kwon.

15
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,699
The competitor analysis data I requested.

16
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:57,992
Is this the best you can do?

17
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,579
Oh, well...

18
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,789
I tried to organize it based on the most objective data possible.

19
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,501
This figure and this figure...

20
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,420
They're from two different sources.

21
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,463
How can you just list them

22
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,130
without any standard for comparison?

23
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,760
This isn't an analysis; it's just a copy-paste job.

24
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,429
Don't you consider the reader's perspective?

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,434
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,684
I must have overlooked that part...

27
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,106
It's basic. This is fundamental.

28
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,983
Since you're new, it's understandable that you might not know.

29
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,987
But if you keep repeating mistakes,

30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,572
it's not a mistake anymore, it's a lack of skill.

31
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,746
By 3 PM today,

32
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,081
get this up to an acceptable standard.

33
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,748
Bring it back to me.

34
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:53,255
This is the rule we set.

35
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,217
At the office, we are perfect strangers.

36
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,096
With the same lips that said "I love you" last night,

37
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,472
she now hurts me.

38
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,730
[Hey, Team Leader Kwon was on fire again today.]

39
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,398
[She was especially focused on Lee Hayoon, wasn't she?]

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,695
[She's always tough on newbies.]

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,612
[But with Lee Hayoon...]

42
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,697
[It seems particularly so.]

43
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,077
[I wonder if there's something going on between them?]

44
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,969
[Ms. Kwon: Break room. 5 minutes.]

45
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,239
You have to eat.

46
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,739
You'll upset your stomach.

47
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,744
Ms. Kwon, this...

48
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
I was too harsh earlier.

49
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,670
Still, you need to show me results, Ms. Lee Hayoon.

50
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,463
I'm expecting a lot.

51
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,179
Focus.

52
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,567
This is her way.

53
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,943
The ice-cold whip,

54
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,362
and every once in a while,

55
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,780
a very small carrot.

56
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,244
And with just that one small gesture, my foolish heart skips a beat again.

57
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,056
What's the problem?

58
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,182
Are you stuck?

59
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,445
The layout in this section looks too cluttered.

60
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,489
Align the text,

61
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,990
and reduce the image size a bit.

62
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,077
And as for this data,

63
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,996
if you visualize it like this,

64
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,873
it will be a little more persuasive.

65
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:09,619
Ms. Kwon...

66
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,913
If you do this here...

67
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,291
You're my undoing.

68
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,842
But...

69
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,592
I can't breathe.

70
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,222
You need to focus, Ms. Lee Hayoon.

71
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,025
Just finish organizing this and go home.

72
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,235
It's too late.

73
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,594
Ms. Kwon...

74
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,811
I'm not 'Ms. Kwon' right now, am I?
