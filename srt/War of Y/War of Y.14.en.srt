1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,440
Damn, I can't find it.

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:03,311
Fuck.

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,320
Go on everyone. Quick.

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,288
Quickly
This is your last chance. It's the last week.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,520
Keep looking.

6
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:21,155
Kla.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,111
You found it?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,960
- Korn, no.
- Give it to me.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,720
- Korn. Stop pulling.
- Kla

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,800
(snatching the phone)

11
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:29,120
Korn.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,777
Damn it, it's a fake one.

13
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:36,800
Hey, Most found it.

14
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,680
Most, give it here Most.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Hey, leave me. Most

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,733
I was stunned.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,088
I did not think it would be this violent.

18
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,200
Of course. It was heated.

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,666
It's the last week, we can't just fool around.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Most.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,377
Ouch.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
Come here. Seoul.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Darn it.

24
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:58,777
Oops.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,533
- It's a fake one.
- Yes!

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,040
Go on. Keep looking for it.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Go, go, go.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,711
It's the last week
Take it more seriously.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,511
Yes.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,844
Oops.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,960
Peek

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,466
I found it first
Don't cheat. Move.

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,377
They aren't looking for who found it first
But for who can take it to Seoul first.

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,040
- Stop.
- Give it here.

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Don't.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,400
(Peek accidentally pushes Earth)

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,680
- Earth. Are you okay?
- Ouch.

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,520
Earth. Give it to me.

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
Did you see when he pushed Earth.

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,640
Who would've thought he would be so competitive.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,800
So mean

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
I feel really bad.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,888
I wanted to go in and help, but.

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,600
It's a game and I have to win.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,160
- Give it here.
- Why is it so difficult?

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
- Damn it.
- Hey!

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
It's tiring and people are getting hurt.

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Sometimes it just about this.

49
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,511
Here you go Seoul.

50
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:05,977
Oops.

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,720
It's the real one.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
- Congratulations.
- Dammit.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,333
The privilege for this week, is yours Achi.

54
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,422
Use this 10 minutes wisely.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,160
- Fuck.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:20,555
Ouch.

57
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,800
If you find the phone first.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,533
Call the acting coach.

59
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:55,933
Ask him for the tricks
we can use for this week.

60
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,422
Yeah. Deal.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Hello. Mom.

62
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,244
I am in a meeting.

63
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,333
I will hang it up now.

64
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,133
Mom.

65
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:10,816
(Y Bro Mean Phiravich Attachit'sataporn)
Hello.

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,866
Welcome everyone
to the world of reality.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
There will be a singing show
by all 6 of you.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,466
You will be asked
questions to test your views.

69
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:19,680
And most importantly.

70
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Is acting in a series together.
3 scenes for each pair.

71
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,288
That will be played in the final round.

72
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:27,130
And the series that you will be playing.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,800
Is the first Y series in Thailand.

74
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:32,355
That got P and Dew famous.

75
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,440
As the legendary shipped couple.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Dew and P will be picking your pairs.

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,177
And each pair will
have to play the same series.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Goodluck everyone. Be yourself.

79
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,688
Love Sick. Engineer's true love.

80
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:59,840
In the morning, you will be rehearsing by yourselves.

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
In the afternoon.

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,222
Acting coach will come in to see.

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,960
The car will leave at 4:30am.

84
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,444
- What!
- All of you will be on location at 5am.

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
- That's so brutal.
- So early.

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Welcome to the reality.

87
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:23,511
And as the winner of the Best singer from last week.

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,200
And the winner from Wai Jai Y show.

89
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,320
Most and Achi will be paired together.

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Achi, you can change your pair.

91
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Do you want to change?

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
No, I don't.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,244
Other pairs will be picked by the crew members.

94
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:48,644
The second and third pair is.

95
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,022
Kla and Earth.

96
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,555
Yes.

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,960
Lets do this bro.

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,955
And.

99
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,200
Korn and Peek.

100
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,377
When the name was announced,
your face turned pale.

101
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:08,666
Who did you want to pair with?

102
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,280
I will do my best,
no matter who my pair is.

103
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,840
We finally get to pair up.

104
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,920
Pakin.

105
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,333
Is me.

106
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,622
Lean in to kiss.

107
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,311
Weha, you.

108
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,088
Until your back hit's the locker.

109
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,555
After the kiss, you say.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
What did you say just now.

111
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,533
I, I love you.

112
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,400
Cut to the toilet scene. Both of them
removed the lips after the kiss.

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Damn.

114
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,155
This is intense.

115
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:03,311
Thank god it's not the blanket falling scene,
the hot NC scene in legend.

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
Are you okay.

117
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,377
Yeah, why not.

118
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,466
We must do if we want to win.

119
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,755
Good that you think this way.

120
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,200
Don't know how other pairs are doing?

121
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:18,444
I think they are shocked
just be reading the script.

122
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:19,777
Especially Peek.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,955
He must be most shocked.

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Did you see his face

125
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,177
when they announced
Kla paired with Peek?

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,560
You noticed that?

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,333
Not just notice.

128
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,022
I have seen it with my eyes.

129
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,280
During the dance week.

130
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,711
That's why he chose me for the singing week.

131
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,400
Last night they had a fight too.

132
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,066
About Peek's family.

133
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,066
His dad can't accept him like this.

134
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,533
However, Achi will survive.

135
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,511
He has always played these kind of roles.

136
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah.

137
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:27,155
But his personality is
very sexy and fierce.

138
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,311
Sis.

139
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,222
But Kla and Earth.

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,088
It's muscle with muscle.

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,377
I can't imagine it.

142
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,088
And can you imagine Korn Peek kissing?

143
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:40,920
He's very shy.

144
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
No, last week.

145
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,160
He was kissing Most.

146
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,200
This week he might be
into the character.

147
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,200
And kiss Korn.

148
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Wait.

149
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:53,911
Peek can't kiss everyone.

150
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,066
I will make it a lot better.

151
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
One more time.

152
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,600
I can't.

153
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Do this.

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
All day.

155
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
All day?

156
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
All day man.

157
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
What.

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
I can't.

159
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,000
The script is so cringy.

160
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,440
- I agree.
- Don't you think so?

161
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,333
Sir.

162
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,844
You've played like this before.
Can you share some tips?

163
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,822
How did you do it that you don't laugh.

164
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,720
I can't stop laughing.

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,520
You have to close your eyes and think
of the person you love before playing.

166
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,620
Ah I see.

167
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay, I will try.

168
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I can't.

169
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Just can't.

170
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,680
Open your eyes and seeing Kla.

171
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,244
How will I do it.

172
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,600
You have to believe first.

173
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:23,400
Not everyone is lucky to get
to play with the person you like.

174
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:25,488
Am I right, Kla?

175
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,466
If we get to play with someone we love.

176
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,360
It would've been easier right.

177
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:32,533
Yeah.

178
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:33,711
Probably.

179
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,400
Should we rehearse.

180
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,177
The sound is too loud, I can't concentrate.

181
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,577
I'm going outside.

182
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,422
Woo.

183
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,977
Korn.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
I am so tired. To pretend
to be someone else all the time.

185
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,560
I am so tired. To pretend
to be someone else all the time.

186
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:42,800
I am so tired. To pretend
to be someone else all the time.

187
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,844
How many times has Teacher Vivian
told you not to rehearse alone?

188
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,044
Hey.

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
I asked Korn to exchange partners.

190
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,866
And. Already spoke to the crew.

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,244
Everyone is okay with it.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,511
So they can create a drama?

193
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
And aren't you feeling uncomfortable.

194
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,911
Or...

195
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,488
Are you scared that staying with Earth
and you won't have any airtime?

196
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
Can you stop acting like this?

197
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:26,577
What the hell is wrong with you?

198
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,133
Are you an actor in one of the series
that comes after the news.

199
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,560
- If you are here to fight. Go away.
- I am here to clear with you.

200
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,520
Clear what? I have nothing to clear.

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,244
I think I am already very clear with you.

202
00:13:58,711 --> 00:13:59,377
Yes.

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
They asked me to take care of him for the whole year.

204
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,377
But you have to bare it.

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,911
Cause I will take care of you forever.

206
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,377
Speak to me directly.

207
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I am your senior.

208
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,155
I know.

209
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,177
You are angry that...

210
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
- that I Kissed you that night.
- It's a different thing.

211
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
It's the same thing.

212
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:50,760
If you don't know yourself.

213
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:52,920
If you can't accept yourself.

214
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,960
You can never be the character.

215
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,022
You are the person I love.

216
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,240
- Like this?
- Yes, like this.

217
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh!

218
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,644
They are playing this good
even though they fight everyday.

219
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
Imagine if they love each other,
how good will it be.

220
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,960
Hey.

221
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,933
Sir.

222
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,733
Not all shipped couples.

223
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
Have to love each other.

224
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,666
That's true.

225
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,577
It is all just acting.

226
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,400
No need to be so into the character.

227
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,622
Yeah.

228
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:43,933
Were we really that into it.

229
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,920
Kla, do you want to rehearse for us to see.

230
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Yeah sure.

231
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Come, Kla.

232
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,800
Come on, show us.

233
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:56,266
Go, go. Show what you got.

234
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,333
Go, go, go.

235
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,000
- You can do.
- Give it a try.

236
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,822
- Should I start?
- Let's go man.

237
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:09,577
Ready?

238
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,444
What kind of person I am?
I don't even know.

239
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,066
Hey, Peek.

240
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:22,911
This is supposed to be a love story.

241
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,444
Not fighting.

242
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,466
Play cutely, be more into it.

243
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,866
I want to do it my way.

244
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Hmm.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,333
Then how will it lead to a kiss?

246
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Sir.

247
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:40,960
Let me play first.

248
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:43,760
His concentration will break.

249
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,244
Come on. Try again.

250
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Restart again.

251
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,911
Fight.

252
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,711
Ready?

253
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,333
Come on.

254
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,155
What kind of person I am?
I don't even know.

255
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,840
You are the person I love.

256
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,840
What did you say just now?

257
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:33,911
Peek.

258
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,000
I think you should be a little more gentle.

259
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,200
It doesn't look very soft.

260
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,755
Yeah.

261
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,080
And why don't you do a real kiss.

262
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,511
Or scared that you won't be able to stop?

263
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,222
We can do a real kiss on the day.

264
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:51,644
This is just the rehearsal.

265
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,222
Just rehearing but you can kiss really.

266
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,622
Bring yourself out Peek.

267
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,044
Don't act like you have never done it.

268
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:02,866
Being myself like how you are doing.

269
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:03,720
Like no matter what.

270
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,060
No matter what movie you're in,
you moan really loudly.

271
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,840
You bastard.

272
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,488
Can you guys not fight for one day?

273
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,911
Don't think that everyone is like you, Peek.

274
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,333
Like what, how am I, say it.

275
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,120
Say it. Why are you going to hit me?

276
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,822
Or slap me.

277
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,760
- Slap.
- You too Achi.

278
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,088
Peek, if you use violence,
you will be disqualified.

279
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,888
You are scared of being kicked out.

280
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,800
Or scared that people would know
that you don't know how to fight.

281
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,440
Peek. That's enough.

282
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,920
Don't.

283
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,280
Peek.

284
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,160
Kla, Kla.

285
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,840
Peek, what the hell did you do?

286
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,111
Stop.

287
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:38,066
What happened here.

288
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:40,355
Peek.

289
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,777
Achi.

290
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:43,022
Kla.

291
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:44,360
Go to Pond's office.

292
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,311
Go to the office.

293
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,066
Now.

294
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,660
(Y Idol Crew)
(Gateway: I just pretended to talk about Achi
so Peek will be motivated and fight)

295
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,456
(Y Idol Crew)
(Gateway: But instead he became annoyed
and stopped rehearsing. Will he survive?)

296
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,496
(Y Idol Crew)
(Bank: Blame Morphin.)
(Morphin: I told you to prepare
a script/ I am not good at improvising)

297
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
(Y Idol Crew)
(Gateway: K. Pond. Kla wants
to switch partners to be with peek)

298
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,096
(Y Idol Crew)
(Gateway: Allowing so easily?)
(Pond: Yes, this easy Peek pairing with Korn is not realistic.
I like something pleasing to watch)

299
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,666
Peek.

300
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,170
(Next Break)

301
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Don't you regret anything?

302
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,466
You were almost kicked out of the show.

303
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,600
You think I'm happy to be here on the show?

304
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,466
If you don't believe, you can call the witness.

305
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,355
Peek was going to punch me.

306
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,600
- But Achi started it. He said...
- Stop it, Peek.

307
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,042
Well...

308
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,644
Peek didn't do it purposely.

309
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,888
And I am not that hurt.

310
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,800
Kla, don't support him like that.

311
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:46,311
He did wrong so he must accept it.

312
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,222
Achi and Kla, good that you are not hurt.

313
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,622
Say sorry to each other and go wait for the acting coach.

314
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,800
But Peek did against the rules twice already, Pond.

315
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:57,800
Go, both of you

316
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,400
I will see to Peek.

317
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,917
Bye.

318
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,022
Why is it taking so long?

319
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,755
If nothing, he should be back by now.

320
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,600
You.

321
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,688
He did wrong. Twice.

322
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,866
There must be some penalty.

323
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,022
Hey.

324
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,208
Or...

325
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,155
Peek is packing his bags to go back home?

326
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,667
Hopefully not.

327
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,542
Punished.

328
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,866
And out if it happens again.

329
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,533
Just punished. Why was it so long?

330
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,733
Yeah!

331
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,244
They made me read the contract.

332
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,959
And repeated that if I quit.
Or get kicked out.

333
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,311
I would have to pay the show 2 million.

334
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,600
And gave some more lectures
about thinking of my parents and dreams.

335
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,625
Don't know what.

336
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,375
Peek.

337
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,111
Don't you regret it?

338
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,406
What do I need to regret about?

339
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,888
You went too far.

340
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,466
This time was way too much.

341
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,555
But who started it.

342
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,125
He bullied me.

343
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,457
You want me to stay still.

344
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,955
You were almost kicked out from the show.

345
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,177
Still acting smart.

346
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,625
What are you going to do.

347
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,666
Do you think I am happy with this show>

348
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,488
I am worried about you.

349
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,111
I don't want you to do anything bad anymore.

350
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,399
Why don't you just punch each other?

351
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,911
So you can leave from here where you aren't happy.

352
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,666
It's just 2 million.

353
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,600
Rich person like you can definitely afford it.

354
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:03,667
Oh.

355
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,082
I forgot.

356
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,711
You are acting rich.
Actually it's all a story you created.

357
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:12,911
That's enough. Hey, hey.

358
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,644
Lets go outside.

359
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,755
It's very uncomfortable here.

360
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,583
Okay.

361
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,200
Do you know, why I got you outside
instead of the practice room?

362
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,288
So we don't only focus on ourselves.

363
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes, very good Achi.

364
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,933
But as an actor...

365
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,088
we have to allow our audience
to see all of our sides.

366
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,511
Yeah!

367
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,555
But then sometimes.

368
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,288
We don't we see that side of ourself.

369
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,533
Many times.

370
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,533
We don't even know it exists.

371
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:12,222
Even if you look into the mirror,
you won't be able to see it.

372
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,622
So today, I want you all
to help your friend.

373
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,577
Be a mirror for them.

374
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,133
Be honest.

375
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,822
Be a reflection for your friend
so they can know...

376
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
how you see them.

377
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,844
Anything about them that you like.

378
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
And what you don't like.

379
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,777
- Yes.
- Now, I will let each pair...

380
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,888
Turn towards each other and hold hands.

381
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:37,711
Yeah.

382
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,533
Take how long ever you want. Go.

383
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,166
Start.

384
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,333
Don't be angry at me.

385
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,750
It is an exercise.

386
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,417
I see.

387
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,333
That you work really hard.

388
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,733
Not only here.

389
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,959
But since university.

390
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:36,709
And I.

391
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,355
Respect you for that.

392
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,777
You bare the tiredness.

393
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,466
You do things that you don't like.

394
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:49,488
For your family.

395
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,244
And now that I know.

396
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,400
That you are not okay with your family.

397
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,444
I really respect you Peek.

398
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:08,866
I see you Peek.

399
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,750
If you think.

400
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,542
Your parents.

401
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,666
Or people in this house don't see it.

402
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,977
But I see.

403
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,241
And it's what I like about you.

404
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,955
But your efforts.

405
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,166
Sometimes it's not the right point.

406
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,488
You are trying to hide who you are.

407
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,375
How you feel.

408
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,622
And I don't like it.

409
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,959
About you.

410
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,422
Don't have to pretend to be brave.

411
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,222
Or strong all the time.

412
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,844
Show your feelings.

413
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,088
When you don't feel okay.

414
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:06,980
Or if you cannot take it anymore.

415
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,911
You can show it to me Peek.

416
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,711
I am your brother.

417
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,943
Can I say what I don't like first?

418
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:36,266
There's a lot.

419
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,555
I don't like when you understand me.

420
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,711
Don't like that you tease me.

421
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,977
Fight with me.

422
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,911
It makes me feel weak.

423
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,000
Not as strong as I want to be.

424
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,311
But today I've seen it.

425
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,022
You only do that
because you want me to be happy.

426
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,266
You want me to feel better.

427
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,082
Thanks.

428
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,166
For noticing it.

429
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,577
And being worried about me.

430
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:28,977
Even though you like to end it
with annoying comments.

431
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,422
Thank you Kla.

432
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,377
Yeah.

433
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
While everyone was rehearsing for
the Star and Moon competition.

434
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,133
Kla pulled Peek to the stage.

435
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,917
He kissed. He smooched.

436
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,333
He licked him all over.

437
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,777
Before whispering in his ears.

438
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:06,755
Are you ready to receive your trophy.

439
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:08,792
Is the trophy big.

440
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,200
If not, I won't accept it.

441
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,022
Peek turned Kla around hungrily.

442
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:21,750
Without caring the eyes of people in the room.

443
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,111
Are you that horny.

444
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,266
They kissed on the stage.

445
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
The sound of their breathing echoed in the room.

446
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,622
They exchanged tongues.

447
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,133
All the shyness was gone.

448
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,888
Because the kiss was sweet and nice.

449
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,022
That they leaned in close to each other.

450
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:42,866
Peek kissed harder.

451
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,082
He stared into Kla's eyes.

452
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,511
Tempting him.

453
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,622
His hands were going lower along Kla's legs.

454
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,155
The special talent, he didn't care about it anymore.

455
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,222
Kla's trophy was much bigger and better.

456
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,460
Right in the center of the stage.

457
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,155
Who wrote the fiction.

458
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,288
I asked, who wrote the fiction.

459
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,044
No one.

460
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,266
Give me your phone.

461
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,333
Let's go.

462
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,377
So it's you guys.

463
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,311
If you were BL fan, I understand.

464
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,777
But you are purposely humiliating him.

465
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,667
Do you know?

466
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,177
He can't even come to study these days.

467
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,622
You, go to the student affairs with me.

468
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,955
Hey! Calm down.

469
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,444
Here.

470
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,155
- If you don't want it, I'm going to throw.
- Hey, wait.

471
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:21,111
Are you my junior or my son?

472
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,208
Here.

473
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,205
If anyone teases you again.

474
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,542
Come tell me.

475
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:41,792
I will see to it for you.

476
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,977
You only do that because you want me to be happy.

477
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,417
It's not the same.

478
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:00,400
Only I can tease you.

479
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,184
And didn't you get this for me?

480
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,208
But having it yourself.

481
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,866
Thank you Kla.

482
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,933
For taking care of me.

483
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,755
You pretend to scold.

484
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,088
But always there for me.

485
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,200
When I'm tired from preparing my special show.

486
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,088
You get me water.

487
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,577
The day I went for donation volunteer.

488
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,533
You wiped my sweat for me.

489
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,511
If I miss any class to go for activities.

490
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,888
I get your lectures notes.

491
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,355
To help me.

492
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,822
If I have any problem

493
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,488
I have you to help me clear.

494
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,577
Even if you tease me everytime.

495
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,911
I won't be here.

496
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,644
If I didn't have you.

497
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,333
Okay.

498
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,955
Well.

499
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,511
How was it?

500
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,288
How did you find out?

501
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,311
It's...

502
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,844
- I feel relieved.
- Are you?

503
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,755
Very good.

504
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,082
- Feeling good.
- Me too.

505
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,311
That's good.

506
00:34:08,377 --> 00:34:09,644
That was good right? And.

507
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,244
Anyone has
anything they are worried about?

508
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,542
Teacher Vivian.

509
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,644
For NC in the locker room scene.

510
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:19,822
Should it be intense.

511
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,292
Hmm.

512
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,177
It's.

513
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,822
I think.

514
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,244
In that scene, the leads are having a open heart talk.

515
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,200
I feel it should be a sweet kiss.

516
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,888
That's enough.

517
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,844
You don't have to worry...

518
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,622
about the scene not being tense.

519
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,125
Sometimes.

520
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,111
Simple but honesty.

521
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,266
Touches the audience.

522
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,111
Okay.

523
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,422
Oh, this industry.

524
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,688
Likes to think that acting coaches.

525
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,222
Is Wanda Maximoff.

526
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,622
Who can just make anything happen.

527
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,622
But I am.

528
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:58,422
Taking.

529
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,355
Taking all my experience.
And sharing all the techniques with you all.

530
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
You have to choose and adapt.

531
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,844
Allow yourself to develop.

532
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,222
Yeah!

533
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,711
Okay.

534
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,800
See you all on the sets tomorrow.

535
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,000
Okay.

536
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,133
- The class has ended?
- Yes, class dismissed.

537
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,866
Thank you.

538
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:39,780
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: "Achi can have smokey grey hair like Deathnote"
"Earth can have long brown hair like Tarzan")

539
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,090
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Crap, long cut short is okay but turning short hair long? I'm confused)

540
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:41,115
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: What is this?)
(Bank: Pond has asked everyone to get a makeover.
But after coming back to the camp,
they have to come back to themselves. I want to scream!)

541
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,140
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: What for?)
(Aom: At first, he wanted to do for Peek alone
but he's scared it will be suspicious
so he asked to change for everyone)

542
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,933
(Bank: He wants Peek to have the same hair style
as when he was in the "Moon and Star competition",
so FC's can "scream like the time they did
when Peek was a student")
(Boss: Good luck, my friend)

543
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,208
Peek.

544
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,377
Come with me.

545
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,100
(Next Break)

546
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,266
What are you shooting for.

547
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,495
They will come and call you.

548
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,955
Go get ready.

549
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Hey, you.

550
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,488
What's wrong.

551
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,200
Stressed?

552
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,177
Nothing.

553
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,600
I just want to do my best.

554
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,775
I am tired to fight with others.

555
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,311
You just have to do your best.

556
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,000
Winnin or not winning, doesn't matter.

557
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:47,977
Okay?

558
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:55,088
Come on. Let's go eat with the extras.

559
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:56,690
They are fun to talk to.

560
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,933
Wanna go?

561
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,333
Can I come?

562
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:02,222
Hey of course. Come.

563
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,111
Yeah, lets go.

564
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,577
Lead the way.

565
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:10,317
Oh wow.

566
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,533
This sunrise is beautiful.

567
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:17,111
If I had my phone, my story would be never ending.

568
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:18,577
Yeah.

569
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:20,222
Sigh!

570
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,377
Oops.

571
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,533
Be serious Most.

572
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,644
Don't play around.

573
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,755
What, I am just relaxing.

574
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:35,266
It's almost time to film.

575
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,260
Lets go practice the dialogue.

576
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:41,044
Yeah lets go.

577
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,044
Quick.

578
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,155
Wow, but this is really beautiful.

579
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:50,733
Most.

580
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:52,020
Lets go.

581
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,150
Why are you in a hurry?

582
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:09,533
It's another 2 hours until our turn.

583
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:11,577
I don't know.

584
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,020
Gate told me to get ready.

585
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,377
Oh.

586
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,644
It's not straight.

587
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:23,400
Punishment?

588
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:25,644
It's good now.

589
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,644
Good.

590
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:31,822
Peek.

591
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,444
Come with me.

592
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,244
Yes.

593
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:41,644
Where are you going.

594
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,977
Achi.

595
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,111
Your hair is done, why haven't you changed.

596
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:48,859
Go change.

597
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:50,444
Peek.

598
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:58,942
It's really fun

599
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,022
I want to shoot already.

600
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,311
Because if I win,
we will get to act in a series just like this.

601
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:06,822
If you want to see me in a series,
don't forget to vote for me.

602
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:10,133
This is the final week.

603
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,466
How do you feel. We won't be meeting anymore.

604
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,422
Well.

605
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,622
I am going to miss everyone.

606
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,466
P

607
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,622
Hmm.

608
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,155
What are they shooting for?

609
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,044
This?

610
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,980
It's for the highlight.

611
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,400
And do I have to shoot this?

612
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,690
They will call you.

613
00:39:58,275 --> 00:39:59,275
Go get ready.

614
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,822
Okay.

615
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:03,984
Hello.

616
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:17,155
Way.

617
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,355
Way.

618
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:21,859
Damn it Way.

619
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:27,866
Where are you going.

620
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:32,866
I am not letting you go anywhere.

621
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:35,107
Or what?

622
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,108
I am your brother.

623
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,711
I'm so sick of it.

624
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,422
That I to pretend to be like
someone else all the time.

625
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,466
Then be yourself.

626
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,844
I don't even know who I really am.

627
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:00,377
However you are, I still love you.

628
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:10,692
This one is really good.

629
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,733
Really.

630
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,777
I really love you.

631
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,622
Cut. Cut.

632
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,088
What do you think P.

633
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:38,942
I think its okay.

634
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,067
Yeah right?

635
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,150
And Pond?

636
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:44,751
Actually, its really good
but can it be a little more like, crushing?

637
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,022
Oh.

638
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:50,692
I think if it's a more crushing,
it will be like porn movie.

639
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,177
About this much is okay.

640
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,000
Right?

641
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,222
Go.

642
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,688
Relax.

643
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,200
Most.

644
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,177
Do you think.

645
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,933
They really liked it?

646
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,933
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

647
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,711
You have no right...
- I am your brother.

648
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,355
I'm sick of it. Pretending to be someone else.

649
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:56,859
Hey, wait.
I think you should play for real.

650
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:58,026
Like how you rehearsed.

651
00:42:58,107 --> 00:42:59,209
How you rehearsed. Like that.

652
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,355
So you will know how it is when you really act.

653
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:01,422
Okay.

654
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,133
You, are they going to really kiss?

655
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,688
I'm so sick of pretending
to be someone else.

656
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,288
Okay, that's enough.

657
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,088
Teacher, they've been rehearsing right?

658
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,822
Anyhow, please get them to relax a bit.

659
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,866
So they can play with the feels.

660
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,600
Can I have them for a moment.

661
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:44,644
Okay.

662
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,275
Then help them relax first.

663
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,200
Sure.

664
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:03,975
Be more confident in yourself.

665
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,600
We have rehearsed so well.

666
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:09,692
I know I have to think like that.

667
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:11,900
I feel pressured.

668
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:14,107
I want to do well.

669
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,644
So we can win together like
how we promised Pla and Toon.

670
00:44:31,275 --> 00:44:32,275
Do you know...

671
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,777
what your problem is?

672
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,155
You are doing for the script.

673
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,866
Doing for the character.

674
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,288
But not doing it to please anyone
or prove your ability.

675
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,107
However you feel.

676
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:52,317
Express it.

677
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,488
Watch.

678
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:08,866
Try it.

679
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:22,888
One more time.

680
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,066
Come on man.

681
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,692
Stop flaring your nose.

682
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,100
Come on. Lets go shoot.

683
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:06,358
I am so tired to pretend to be someone else.

684
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,355
Then be yourself.

685
00:46:20,107 --> 00:46:21,442
How am I?

686
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:23,233
I don't even know.

687
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:45,108
However you are.

688
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,511
I still love you.

689
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:36,026
Try to see it.

690
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:39,111
Listen to it carefully.

691
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:43,060
Express it with meaning.

692
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,711
This is all acting is about.

693
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:47,646
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: what do you think Pond and Rith talked about?)
(Aom: Asking Tai to do something maybe?)

694
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,671
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Tai: Doing the same hairstyle same
as when in university. Great look)
(Boss: Sure.. The show doesn't have a script locked
but this is too open)

695
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:49,696
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Understood why Achi is annoyed
If he can kill Peek with his eyes,
he would have done already)

696
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,600
(Aom: Will they slap each other again?
(Boss: Go on slap! If it was me, I would've slapped
Honestly, what is Peek good at?
The show is helping him get publicity
The privileges that people can get here is insane!)

697
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,200
(Next Break)
What punishment.

698
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,577
Why is everyone acting nice to you.

699
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,488
You weren't punished.

700
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,733
But you had something with him right?

701
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:36,377
Okay, keep the position.

702
00:48:36,888 --> 00:48:38,222
Camera, listen carefully.

703
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,466
Move the camera to.

704
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,400
Capture.

705
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,377
Peeks face clearly
and take the angle from the side of.

706
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,288
Kla's shoulder.

707
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,533
Take only Peek's face and then move the lights.

708
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,733
Yeah, now the light.

709
00:48:49,955 --> 00:48:50,733
Take it nicely.

710
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,780
Yeah. Crew, prepare to shoot next.

711
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,066
And.

712
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,622
Action.

713
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,340
About Peek, I will take care of it.

714
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,466
Isn't it taking too long,

715
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,511
If there's nothing, he should be back already.

716
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,140
He broke the rule twice.

717
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:15,444
There must be some penalty,

718
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,911
What did you say?

719
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:52,533
I love you.

720
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:10,711
Cut.

721
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:12,422
Pass. Move,

722
00:50:17,066 --> 00:50:18,777
Wasn't that scene supposed to be a sweet kiss?

723
00:50:19,355 --> 00:50:20,866
The aggressive kiss was the scene in the gym.

724
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:24,155
Didn't you see Kla and Peek play?

725
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,340
If we didn't do it, we would lose.

726
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,900
Why are you only looking to win?

727
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:30,888
You even forgot your dialogue.

728
00:50:32,444 --> 00:50:35,155
Ah, it's a pass. Lets move.

729
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,200
Hold on Rith,

730
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:39,222
The scene just now, can I redo.

731
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,955
Umm, I thinks its already okay,

732
00:50:43,022 --> 00:50:45,222
We can edit during the post production and,

733
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,222
If we change, it will break the schedule.

734
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:49,666
If the schedule is broken, it isn't because of me.

735
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:50,711
Achi,

736
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,000
When Peek wasn't able to play.

737
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,355
You all created the ambiance for him.

738
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,400
Didn't that break the schedule.

739
00:50:58,911 --> 00:50:59,600
Achi.

740
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:01,666
Don't create a scene,

741
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:03,340
This is not Y Idol camp,

742
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,333
But its not fair,

743
00:51:05,977 --> 00:51:07,940
Why can Peek play for hours?

744
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,822
But me and Korn has only one take.

745
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,020
You think people can't make out,

746
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:18,133
They are helping him win.

747
00:51:18,688 --> 00:51:19,860
Calm down Achi.

748
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,266
If you have anything, lets talk at the camp.

749
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,244
Understand?

750
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,466
What's happening?

751
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:31,533
Peek.

752
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,200
What did you speak to Pond that day?

753
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,133
- You weren't punished, weren't you.
- Calm down.

754
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,540
- Answer me.
- You calm down.

755
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:43,900
I was given the punishment. I already told you.

756
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:45,600
Punishment?

757
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,777
What kind of punishment?

758
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:50,622
Why is everyone nice to you?

759
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,444
Why will the director build the ambience for you?

760
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,860
- Calm down.
- Answer me.

761
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,622
You weren't punished, were you.

762
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,380
You had something with him right?

763
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,620
Achi.

764
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,980
Achi. Pond.

765
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:10,533
Achi.

766
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:11,888
Come see me in the office.

767
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,533
Damn, this isn't fair.

768
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:37,140
He created so many stories but still got through,

769
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,860
Do I even deserve this?

770
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,140
This punishment.

771
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:42,022
I only made one mistake.

772
00:52:42,777 --> 00:52:44,755
What is wrong with the show?

773
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,688
I know,

774
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:52,888
But what can you do?

775
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:56,355
Yeah, what can I do?

776
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:58,600
To make Peek get out of here.

777
00:52:58,977 --> 00:53:00,422
He's so annoying.

778
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,420
Don't you feel tired?

779
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:23,288
Hmm.

780
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,380
I heard you on the phone.

781
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,000
Hey,

782
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,340
I won't tell anyone.

783
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,222
I understand.

784
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,820
Why do you want to make yourself even more tired?

785
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,420
About playing the game,

786
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
It's already tiring,

787
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,540
And you have to think about Peek too.

788
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,244
You...

789
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,860
You are the best in this house.

790
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,020
Whatever the crew ask you to do,

791
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,111
You can do it.

792
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,380
Honestly,

793
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,888
You don't have to play the game with anyone.

794
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,180
You just have to do your duty.

795
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,266
That's it.

796
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,780
You can easily win the show.

797
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,380
The problem is with me.

798
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,780
Doing my duty.

799
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,644
But in the end Peek gets all the good.

800
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,355
And if the show is really cheating,

801
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:55,733
What we have been doing will be destroyed.

802
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,400
No matter how much you try, it will be wasted.

803
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,244
I knew I'd find you here.

804
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:33,911
The swimming pool is like our spot now.

805
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,466
Thank you.

806
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,340
I passed today, because of you.

807
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:44,660
Thank you too.

808
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:46,133
See?

809
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,020
When you open up, you can survive.

810
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:53,820
Surviving now doesn't mean I will always survive.

811
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:57,180
You've seen it how my family is.

812
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,460
It's not easy for me to open up.

813
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
Come on!

814
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,180
It will be better,

815
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,200
You also got better.

816
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,755
Really?

817
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
How?

818
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:20,800
Can you tell me?

819
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,177
You smiled.

820
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,180
Smiled without me teasing you.

You are always in the camp.

826
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,711
How will you see the stars?

827
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:01,800

829
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,180
Oh, Peek.

830
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,580
I am sorry for kissing you that night.

831
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:34,940
Don't be sorry.

832
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,111
I understand. You wanted to service.

833
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,866
Wait.

834
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,820
You were angry at me...

835
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,511
because you thought I was doing service?

836
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,340
Eh.

837
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,180
Isn't it right?

838
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,580
You said it yourself.

839
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,340
"Don't you want more spotlight?"

840
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,300
You said like this.

841
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,422
I did say that,

842
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,660
But what I meant was...

843
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,900
Peek.

844
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,980
Peek, are you at the balcony?

845
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,066
I'm here.

846
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:40,333
Peek.

847
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,577
Come down here. It's urgent,

848
00:58:43,355 --> 00:58:43,888
Coming.

849
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,155
I had to take a video and send it to TTV.

850
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,420
They really liked it.
They said you were very natural.

851
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,980
Natural like stone or tree?

852
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,777
Don't be modest.

853
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,140
Normally,

854
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,780
towards the end of shows,

855
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:12,860
We will call the potential winners to talk
about the contract.

856
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,380
Don't worry.
I've already spoken to others.

857
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,844
It's like this. If you win,

858
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,660
You have to sign a contract.

859
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,340
So you can become an actor

860
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:25,500
for the company who will cast for series.

861
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:29,660
Wait. Does this mean I have a chance to win?

862
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,100
There's just the special song
and answering the question left.

863
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,288
Don't worry.

864
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
It's like this. I called you to talk because.

865
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:40,620
I want you to be prepared.

866
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:44,555
If from P's team, Kla doesn't win.

867
00:59:45,777 --> 00:59:47,333
I want you to distance yourself from Kla.

868
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:48,311
For me.

869
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,580
(Bank: "When I tell about you, you can't take it.
You want to be an idol with attitude? Our show should have a vote for transparency
how will they choose? Shouldn't you take
the time picking on others to work on yourself")

870
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,556
(Bank: This is what Pond said
to Achi in front of the whole camp, Boss)

871
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,822
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: 555 how daring. But didn't they really lock?)
(Pond: Don't let anyone talk about locking the winner again. And Gateway, I asked you to bring him, is he here yet?)
(Aom: Here it is)

872
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:07,940
(The Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: Get who?)
(Bank: Don't know, what a secret.)
(Aom: For sure there is Peek who is being called from
the rooftop but don't know who has Gateway gone to get)

873
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,244
(Boss: I know who is it and why
You guys be ready for the order tomorrow)

874
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:10,900
(Next Week)
Don't you feel troubled at all?

875
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,555
Why are you tensed?

876
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
Don't be.

877
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,244
Just do the best you can. That's it.

878
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:23,044
If you aren't the winner, who
do you want to be the winner for Y Idol?

879
01:00:25,711 --> 01:00:27,822
Are you ready

880
01:00:27,888 --> 01:00:29,780
to be the next Y Idol?

881
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,466
You will have 1 minute.

882
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:33,800
Time starts now.
