I've already added condiments for you.

Nothing.

29
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,555
She's probably full.

30
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,542

I got home and fell asleep.

34
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,600
I am so sorry for not replying to your messages.

35
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Never mind.

36
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,466
I understand.

37
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,955
Achi.

38
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't. Someone will see.

39
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,622
Everyone’s still shooting. It'll be a while.

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,022
Can I stay like this for a while?

41
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,911
Achi.

42
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,666
Don't.

43
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:10,999
Enough.

44
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,911
Stop it.

45
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,911
Achi.

46
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Why did you come today if you're sick?

47
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Do you have a death wish or something?

48
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:51,706
If you're worried about me,

49
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,353
just say it.

50
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,042
Try saying it.

51
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,083
Take some medicine and go home.

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,311
I'l tell the others for you.

53
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,800
How sweet.

54
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,250
Did you hear what I just said?

55
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,577
Cut.

56
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,111
Fern.

57
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,933
Why didn't you scream?

58
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,109
This is the legendary locker scene.

59
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,133
Your role is an FC.

60
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,200
Not a jealous wife like how you're doing it.

61
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,375
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,155
One more time
Everybody, one more time.

63
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,555
Focus on Fern.

64
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,422
Most and Achi, your part is fine.
You can go rest. We will focus on Fern.

65
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,459
Come on. Let's go.

66
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:32,546
Do it properly Fern.

67
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:37,793
Focus.

68
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,444
Achi.

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,533
Let's go.

70
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,533
Sis, honestly, this scene is good
I was really invested.

71
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,911
Yeah but I'm also confused.

72
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Did they have to get so close to each other?

73
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,666
I read the script and it doesn't say anything there.

74
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,918
Oye, these two are really good at improvising.

75
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,266
- The script is 20% and the rest is their chemistry.
- Really?

76
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,185
But the scene just now....
Don't mind me saying this.

77
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,888
Watching from behind the monitors,
I was secretly shipping them.

78
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,792
Me too.

79
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,066
How do you feel about me?

80
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,311
What are your feelings for me?

81
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,822
So, how do you feel about me?

82
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,377
Before asking me.

83
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:54,844
You should ask yourself first.

84
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,288
If you're so good at memorizing the script...

85
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,622
Have you got any feelings for me?

86
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:08,999
No I don't.

87
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
Aren't you feeling cold?

88
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,066
I am.

89
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,622
But not as much as right now.

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
Can you stop being mean with me?

91
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:42,886
You slept with me.

92
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,933
Now you want to leave me already?

93
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,444
Most.

94
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
We can't talk about it here.

95
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,755
Alright, I won't say anything.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,333
But can we do it again here?

97
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,377
Are you crazy?

98
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:05,995
We are still on set.

99
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,555
So what?

100
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,422
If anyone sees,
we can say we're rehearsing.

101
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,088
Please?

102
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,955
Just a little.

103
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,042
A little? Really?

104
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:34,820
Close your eyes.

105
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,600
Can I be the first...

106
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,200
To kiss you here?

107
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,222
How do you know?

108
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,400
That you are the first one.

109
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,688
You told me that you've never kissed a guy before.

110
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,555
Hey, stop messing. Achi, stop messing.

They are asking, when Achi is on set
Who takes care of Cookie?

158
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,093
(Fern, come out)
(Feel bad for Fern, she's almost a spirit now)

159
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,143
(Can you say I love you to little bears?)
(Fern is so pretty today)

160
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,688
(Is P acting in this series)
(Little bear is happy)
Cookie? That evil cat?

161
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:31,050
(What scene is next?)

162
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,375
Let it take care of itself.

163
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,351
(So cute)
(From outside Bangkok, I want to meet them)
(I have energy to work now)

164
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,500
Don't scold him.

165
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,200
He almost bit me last night.

166
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:36,890
(Is it raining)
(I want to send them something, who do I speak to)
(Has Most ever met Cookie)

167
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,111
You didn't stop him too.

168
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:38,890
(Get Cookie to the sets)
(Achi's hair color is so nice)

169
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:39,667
Because you deserved it.

170
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,518
(Heyyy)

171
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:40,999
Deserved it.

172
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:42,435
(Screammm)
(Most went to his place last night?)
(Can't think straight)

173
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,977
FC's are asking if you spent time
at his place last night.

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,760
(They went to each others room)
(I'm so possessive of my son)
(Our baby, we can only take care of him physically)

175
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,887
(I'm going to faint)
(Ship is sailing fast)

176
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:47,744
Yes.

177
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,393
(If anyone’s screaming, I know you are a little bear)

178
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,792
(Most, please take responsibility)
(Moms are ready to hit)
I went to Achi's room last night.

179
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:50,435
(To do what?)

180
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,777
(Dead, dead)
I almost didn't get home.

181
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,876
(Twitter is going to break)
(Northern boy is fast)
I asked if I can stay but he didn't let me.

182
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,602
(Cookie is getting another daddy)

183
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:05,143
(Filled my internet to see them flirting)
Why? I didn't want you to stay.

184
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,042
But I wanted to stay.

185
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,894
(How many of you were there?)
You have a house. Why not go back there?

186
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,758
(Please save this live)
(This ship is too real)

187
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,453
My battery is dying.

188
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,375
Hey, where are you going Fern?

189
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,920
(#Ypoll: If actors are really close on screen,
is it real or just content?)

190
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,133
(#Ypoll: 1. Real 2. Content)

191
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,415
(Next Break)
My name is Oab

192
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,933
I am Achi's brother.

193
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,584
Come back to work with mom

194
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,666
I am working, I have a job.

195
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,955
But I think you should do this just as a hobby.

196
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,911
Mom wants you to have a stable job.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,622
Fern.

198
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,022
Huh.

199
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,733
Are you thinking too much?

200
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,711
- About last night.
- Achi.

201
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,933
New is calling you to set.

202
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Go quick.

203
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
We can talk later.

204
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,222
Then.

205
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,844
Can I go stay with you tonight?

206
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,155
Can I?

207
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
You agreed already.

208
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,133
Promise?

209
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,888
Achi, where are you?

210
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,266
- Quickly.
- I'm going first.

211
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,266
Here I am. I'm coming.

212
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:21,244
Come on. Most Achi, lets get into the scene.

213
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:25,066
So the next scene
Is the one here, on the field here.

214
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,780
- On the field. Yes.
- Have you read the script?

215
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,200
Excuse me, what are you doing?

216
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,177
We're shooting a series
We already asked for permission.

217
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,155
Can I see proof?

218
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,044
Umm. It's in the car
Let's go and see it together.

219
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,022
- Sure.
- This way.

220
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,511
- Hello.
- Hey.

221
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,244
Haven't finished shooting yet?

222
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I thought it started airing.

223
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,355
If its airing, you would've seen it.

224
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,755
- Is this your colleague?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,555
Hi, my name is Oab.

226
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,266
I am Achi's brother.

227
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,888
Hello, I am Most.

228
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,266
Achi's partner.

229
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,488
Oh yeah
When will the shooting finish?

230
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,422
So you can go back and work with mom.

231
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,577
I already told you
I don't want to do.

232
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:23,044
Achi.

233
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,311
But you already promised mom
that you would only do 1 to 2 series.

234
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,911
And this is already your 2nd one.

235
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,244
Go back and work with mom.

236
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:33,711
I am working. I have a job.

237
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,488
Achi.

238
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,222
It's not like this isn't a good career.

239
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,066
But I think you should only do it as a hobby.

240
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,622
Mom wants to see you have a stable job.

241
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,680
The same thing again.

242
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,466
I am a grown up Oab.

243
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,644
Stop talking to me as if I'm a kikd.

244
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,720
Its because I've left you alone before.

245
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,610
That's why it turned out like this.

246
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Yes mom.

247
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,933
I'm alone. Okay.

248
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,311
I will come pick you up.

249
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,066
I'm going first.

250
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:28,866
Take care of yourself.

251
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,688
Come back home too
Mom is worried about you.

252
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,800
Take care of Achi.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,244
If there's anything, let me know.

254
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Sure Oab.

255
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,777
- Thank you.
- Bye.

256
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Are you okay?

257
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,688
Yeah.

258
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,166
Sorry about that.

259
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,488
Oab likes to worry too much.

260
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,222
Did something happen.

261
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,533
which is why he's so worried.

262
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,533
Hey. I'm sorry.

263
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,577
I'm just asking.

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,133
In case I can help with anything.

265
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,266
But if you don't want to tell
Its okay.

266
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Never mind.

267
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,044
If you really want to know.

268
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,266
I will tell you.

269
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,240
It happened when I was in high school.

270
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,644
Hey, Achi.

271
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,511
This is the famous Achi from 10th grade.

272
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,777
What are you doing here alone?

273
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,666
That time I was an outcast.

274
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,444
I had no friends.

275
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:46,266
- I will teach you to skateboard.
- My life was only focused on studying.

276
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,866
- You want to learn?
- So I was a target for the school bullies.

277
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,622
I remember
That day I was so scared.

278
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,044
They came in on their skateboards
And surrounded me.

279
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,288
They tricked me that they would teach me
how to skateboard. But actually they...

280
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,266
His legs are so tiny
Will he be able to skate?

281
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,355
Lets feed him
So he becomes more chubby.

282
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,444
Answer him.

283
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,733
Hey.

284
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
One more time.

285
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
He's about to cry.

286
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,977
- Please leave me alone.
- What's wrong?

287
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,911
Do you want some more?

288
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:39,511
Come on, get up.

289
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,266
If Oab didn't come back to help me...

290
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know what would've happened.

291
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,555
But honestly.

292
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,644
I wouldn't be the same Achi I am today.

293
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,333
I was lucky Oab found me that day.

294
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,577
So he helped me just in time.

295
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,488
I understand Oab.

296
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,440
Because if anything happened to you.

297
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,955
Even I won't forgive myself.

298
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,288
But I don't agree with him.

299
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,866
For asking you to stop acting.

300
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
I think you are...

301
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,222
perfect for this job.

302
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,288
Let's do it together.

303
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,444
Let the world know...

304
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:54,844
that you...

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
belong here.

306
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,111
This is your place.

307
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:03,777
Okay?

308
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,434
(#Ypoll: should actors with a bad past
be given another chance by the society?)

309
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,866
(#Ypoll: 1. Everyone deserves a chance
2. Have to wait and see)

310
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
(Next Break)
Fern has been acting weird these days.

311
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,133
Like shes jealous.

312
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Jealous of who?

313
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,333
Normally I'm never like this.

314
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,222
I don't know what's happening today.

315
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,822
We are just creating content.

316
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,866
If we don't have any moments
How can we compete with other couples?

317
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,276
(Trending in Thailand 1. #MostAchi)

318
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Today the hashtag.

319
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,060
MostAchi is is the number 1 trending topic!

320
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,960
What is going on between them?

321
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,333
(#1 Trending in Thailand: #MostAchi)

322
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,340
#MostAchi is trending in first place again.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,533
Yeah.

324
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:39,380
Because Most went to your room.

325
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,911
Is there anything else I need to know?

326
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,700
He only helped me take stuff up.

327
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:54,020
If he was only helping,
why did you lie to me?

328
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,780
There's really nothing going on.

329
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,700
We are just creating content.

330
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:03,622
If we don't have any moments
How will we be able to compete with other couples?

331
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:05,488
That's it.

332
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,660
Because you only think about yourself.

333
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:13,860
Have you ever thought of me?

334
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,780
I don't know why were dating anymore.

335
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:28,310
There’s no future.

336
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,340
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,420
I'm really sorry.

338
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,900
I only want to be successful.

339
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:59,511
Sorry if that hurt you.

340
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:03,260
Normally I'm not like this.

341
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,660
But I don't know what's happening today.

342
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:13,488
Achi.

343
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,780
I want to see you be successful.

344
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,860
I want you to be be popular.

345
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:30,355
So much that I'm willing to get hurt now.

346
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:34,355
Thank you.

347
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,140
For understanding me.

348
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:00,820
I'm really tired today.

349
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,111
Let's just go to sleep.

350
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:32,940
We are ready for the scene today.

351
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm possessive of him. That's enough.

352
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:52,060
Most.

353
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,820
Calm down if you can.

354
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,740
You are acting in a Y series
Not training to be a wrestler.

355
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,288
- Hmm.
- He's so fit.

356
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,980
If my belly shows in the scene
I'd rather die.

357
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,220
There we go.

358
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,620
He's exaggerating.

359
00:26:09,222 --> 00:26:10,340
Calm down if you can.

360
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:12,755
He's here to play series
Not going into a frying pan.

361
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,140
Most, I cannot.

362
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:18,460
If he's not shining bright in this scene,

363
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:22,622
- I'd rather die.
- Rather die.

364
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:26,820
But you are putting a lot
Will I suffocate on the powder if I get close to him?

365
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:28,580
Ahh! Most.

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,580
Do you have to sniff him that close?

367
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,100
A little. It's...

368
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:37,711
Fern.

369
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,300
We haven't talked much recently.

370
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:42,044
What's wrong?

371
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,000
Did someone say something to you?

372
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:46,260
You can tell me.

373
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,660
It's nothing.

374
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,020
The script is a lot.

375
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:52,840
I need to concentrate.

376
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,580
Fern has been acting weird these days.

377
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:09,100
Like shes jealous.

378
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:11,733
Jealous?

379
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Of who?

380
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,373
Who else?

381
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:20,688
- She's jealous of my sweet Achi.
- Hey, that’s crazy.

382
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:23,660
- Why would she be jealous of me?
- Yeah, what is there to be jealous about?

383
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,460
Its all content.

384
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,666
There’s nothing.

385
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:30,060
Content? But it feels like...?

386
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,180
Nipples are already pink.

387
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,020
Powder has been put on.

388
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,220
Looks okay. Lets go onto set.

389
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,311
New is calling.

390
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,820
Come on quick. Let's get to work.

391
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:51,820
Do you know what scene is next?

392
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:53,622
Are you okay with it?

393
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,580
Yes we are.

394
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:57,644
It's been in the script from the start.

395
00:27:58,688 --> 00:27:59,666
Its good you're okay.

396
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:00,977
But I'm not.

397
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,620
Honestly.

398
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't like doing these scenes at all.

399
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:08,177
But.

400
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,060
I will do my best.

401
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,377
So please...

402
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,860
try to get it done in one take
So we can move on.

403
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:15,911
Okay?

404
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:19,933
Yes.

405
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,340
But I've seen...

406
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,688
that you've done scenes like this in the past.

407
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:29,355
Since I started working with the channel.

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,088
I don't do these scenes anymore.

409
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,066
Okay!

410
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,780
Thank you for being honest.

411
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:51,540
You're not angry right?

412
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:53,933
It is...

413
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:55,622
a little too much.

414
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:57,820
We will do it and show you.

415
00:28:58,244 --> 00:28:59,377
Just one take and it will be done.

416
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:04,300
Okay. If you're ready, lets go.

417
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:05,911
Three.

418
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,333
Two and...

419
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:08,622
action.

420
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:32,660
Can I be yours?

421
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:36,377
Of course.

422
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:54,066
Can I get an inhaler?

423
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,311
Here you go.

424
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,740
There's really nothing going on.

425
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,540
We're just creating content.

426
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,466
If you want to eat, just tell me

427
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:14,755
I'll feed you.

428
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:16,711
Sometimes.

429
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:18,780
I can't tell what's what anymore....

430
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,900
Which is content, which is real.

431
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,020
New, should we cut?

432
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:33,955
Okay, cut.

433
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:35,333
This scene is good.

434
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,488
Thank you both for your energy.

435
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:43,500
How is it New?

436
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,177
It's good.

437
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:08,844
You did well

438
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,567
(#Ypoll: can intense NC scenes push actors
to develop feelings in real life?)

439

2. Yes, actors are humans too)

440
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,500
(Next Break)
Didn't you say it was for content?

441
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,380
But you ended up sleeping with him.

442
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,420
Tell him
Tell him that we are in a relationship.

443
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,377
A relationship where we sleep together
Just like what you did with him.

444
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,688
How could you do this?

445
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,340
Hey Fern.

446
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,977
The emotions were still flowing from earlier.

447
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
You get it, right?

448
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,044
No I don't.

449
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,177
Didn't you say it was all for content?

450
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,044
But you hooked up with him.

451
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,488
Fern.

452
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,888
It was nothing.

453
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,444
You did that when you were my boyfriend.

454
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,511
Boyfriend?

455
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,777
What boyfriend?

456
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,980
Tell him
Tell him that we are in a relationship.

457
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,533
Tell him we sleep together
like what you did with him.

458
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,140
Fern and I are in a relationship.

459
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
What about me?

460
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,980
If you had a girlfriend
Why did you sleep with me?

461
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
For content?

462
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,980
Or were you scared it won't look real

463
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,844
that you had to trick me into loving you?

464
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,180
Why are you quiet?

465
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Calm down Most.

466
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:58,980
Listen to me first.

467
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,140
Listen to what!

468
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,300
You can't be with both of us at the same time.

469
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,733
Who is more important?

470
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,380
My work is the most important.

471
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,420
You bastard.

(RainY: Fern, don't be stupid. You slept with him but does he see you as his wife?
Stop acting like an actress. Because in the end, you are just a back up)

495
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,180
(RainY: You were right)

496
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,380
Yes, P.

497
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,800
Fern isn't here?

498
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,488
Mmm.

499
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,577
Fern has taken 3 days of leave.

500
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,666
I heard that she's very sick.

501
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,400
And...

502
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,060
What about the shooting?

503
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,644
We are adjusting the script.

504
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,422
Let's do this.

505
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,666
Make it so that the character
had an accident and died.

506
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,422
Ok.

507
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,511
Hey you. Do you know what's wrong with Fern?

508
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,180
She's been sick for 2 days already.

509
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,400
I don't know.

510
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,020
Eh, or is she...?

511
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,866
Is she what?

512
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,780
- How would I know? Why are you asking me?
- I don't know.

513
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,260
I'm so tired
Let's go find something to eat

514
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,711
I haven't eaten anything yet
I'm feeling hungry.

515
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,533
Hey.

516
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,111
Do you want to go get something with us?

517
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,311
You guys go. I'm not hungry.

518
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,644
Didn't he just say he was hungry?

519
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,620
Hey, what's this?

520
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,044
Have you guys seen it?

I hired you to keep an eye on him.

525
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Not have sex with him.

526
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,060

Someone saw her buying a pregnancy test.

Are you in your right mind?

As Most's partner.

Not as an extra's husband.

I really have to take responsibility for this, right?

536
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,866
I still want to be here, Most.

I still want to work in this industry
