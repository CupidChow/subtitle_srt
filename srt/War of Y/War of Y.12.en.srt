5
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:05,476
(He's here)

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,602
(The highlight of the week is still #Youkilledmyfather)
With the pressure of the dancing week...

7
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,216
(This show is so mean, they don't even excuse someone who's sick)
(I don't pity him. This is stupid.)(Do you think it's fake? Just to get more rating)(This teacher is bad)
Peek practised really hard until he fainted.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,500
And twisted his ankle.

9
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:17,250
(Has it already started? FC please)
And he is also got weak because of lack of food.

10
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,560
(Achi's FC are blindly cheering, we can see it)
That he had to stop to rest for 24 hours.

11
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:23,351
(He got hurt because the staff threw him down)
Though Peek has received a lot of encouragement from everyone in the camp.

12
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,768
(Show, did he faint or hurt his ankle? I'm confused)(Acting 1)
But support from home viewers are important too.

13
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,459
Do not forget to vote for Peek.

14
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,643
(Peek, Peerapol University Student)
Thank you everyone for your support

15
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,083
I woke up today feeling better than yesterday.

16
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,000
Right now my heart is with the show.

17
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,991
When they allow me to practice.

18
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:42,250
I will rush there immediately.

19
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,586
Wassup bro.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:47,959
Feeling better?

21
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,999
Peek.

22
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,167
How are you Peek.

23
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,667
Is it still hurting.

24
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:55,999
I am fine

25
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:59,542
I am really sorry. We haven't rehearsed together.

26
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,042
You don't have to say sorry to us.

27
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:03,918
I have to say sorry to you.

28
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,584
If I took better care of you, you wouldn't be hurt.

29
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,584
Thank you so much for trying so hard for the team.

30
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:15,787
I am sorry Peek.

31
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:21,959
For Dew's team.

32
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,542
For Dew's team.

33
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,581
Cut.

34
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,334
Great.

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,918
We got the picture.

36
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:40,459
You two, go rehearse.

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,334
Okay.

38
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,316
Yea.

39
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,459
Crew, please lower your voice.

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,334
Outside, you need to be quieter.

41
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:48,792
This is going to be a hit.

42
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:52,250
Is it good? Do you think!

43
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,341
What?

44
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,667
Everyone needs to find a selling point?

45
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:03,709
Shit.

46
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,709
No way.

47
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,531
Are you nuts.

48
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,042
He wouldn't do that.

49
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,167
But if you think properly.

50
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,042
This week, he's got all the air time.

51
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,306
VTR this week is all about him.

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:24,959
Right!

53
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,787
But will he really do it.

54
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,375
Are you thinking too much.

55
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,667
It's nothing.

56
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,468
Not feeling better.

57
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:18,367
My ankle is twisted, I wasn't bitten by a mosquito.

58
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,499
That I will get fine soon.

59
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,709
Good.

60
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:26,786
So you cannot resist me.

61
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,626
Resist what.

62
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:31,397
Hey.

63
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,459
Hey what are you doing. This is forcing.

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,042
It's not good for the show.

65
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
Kla.

66
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,292
It's clear.

67
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,375
You had to create such a big scene.

68
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,375
I am sorry I don't know.

69
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,667
Don't say sorry to me.

70
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,817
You have to say sorry to P and Dew.

71
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:18,834
Hey.

72
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:43,959
Dew.

73
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:44,667
Dew.

74
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,107
Dew, don't listen to what Kla says

75
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,415
I really fainted that day.

76
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:57,884
I thought so.

77
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,417
If we had an oscar award.

78
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:01,542
You would receive it.

79
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,786
There is a chaos in the camp.

80
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:06,891
But for what.

81
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
You created the scene.

82
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,626
Aren't you angry.

83
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:21,853
Angry for what.

84
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,292
I am happy for you.

85
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,894
You know how to play the game now Peek.

86
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,292
But if you come this way.

87
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,417
Play it carefully.

88
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:35,876
If you get caught.

89
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:37,956
You will be asked to leave.

90
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,125
Get it.

91
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,292
Game on.

92
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,167
I will help you.

93
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,876
But Peek is a very responsible person.

94
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:02,918
If he.

95
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,584
Said he's better, but dances and breaks his leg.

96
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,584
Or gets swollen, what will we do.

97
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,520
So you don't want to enter in the competition.

98
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:12,667
I didn't mean that.

99
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,542
Gateway.

100
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:15,083
Yes.

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
Did you speak to the producer.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I spoke to Pond already.

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,334
If the nurse says he can dance.

104
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,918
We can change the steps a little.

105
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
To be easier.

106
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,191
Then we will lose to the other team.

107
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:31,459
That's true

108
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,999
I think we won't be able to do it in time.

109
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
P, Dew.

110
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:46,834
I think I can do it.

111
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,459
Let me practice and see.

112
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:50,912
Hey, don't.

113
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,323
Wait till you get better first.

114
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,751
I will tell the teacher to change the steps.

115
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:58,751
Dew.

116
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,792
Please don't.

117
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,334
Don't change the steps.

118
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,667
It's.

119
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,125
I don't want others to be troubled because of me.

120
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,334
Please Dew.

121
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:13,834
Very good spirit, Peek.

122
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,292
But if you can't do it.

123
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,488
Don't force yourself.

124
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,959
I am worried.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,435
If you can't do, don't force it Peek.

126
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,459
Umm.

127
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,125
Peek, you are doing great.

128
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,334
I can do it. Really.

129
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,918
Thank you all so much.

130
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,959
I feel so bad.

131
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,459
If you feel bad, then get better soon.

132
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:42,301
Yeah.

133
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:43,717
Hey you.

134
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,287
He will be fine by tomorrow.

135
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:47,876
Hes got good support.

136
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,667
Yeah?

137
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,779
Really?

138
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,467
I will feed you myself.

139
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,876
Slow down bro

140
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,000
I hurt my leg, not my hand.

141
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,083
Yeah?

142
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:01,502
Yes.

143
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,430
Whats so difficult with dancing on one leg.

144
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,459
Look here.

145
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:05,765
Hey.

146
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,500
Hey hey.

147
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,584
Hey huh hey.

148
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:13,149
Hey, good, good, good.

149
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,162
More, do it again.

150
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,500
More. Come, come, come. Hey, hey.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Hey, Yeah. Uh, uh uh.

152
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:22,036
Look at this.

153
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,375
It's not difficult.

154
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:26,959
Not as hard as I thought.

155
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,083
You created the scene.

156
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,845
Cause you were scared that you can't dance.

157
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,782
But why am I the one suffering.

158
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,125
Huh.

159
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,348
Didn't you say, you would help me.

160
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,567
I mean help by keeping it a secret.

161
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,439
Not stay wake watching you rehearse.

162
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,375
Stop complaining.

163
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,876
You that good? Huh.

164
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,626
If I compete and my scores are low again.

165
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,245
The plan of winning together, will end there.

166
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:23,598
Yes.

167
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:24,876
I got that already.

168
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,039
Please continue rehearsing.

169
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,626
Get out.

170
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:30,794
Ow.

171
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:32,932
Start.

It's not locked.

183

Not like this. Like this.

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,068
- In just a moment.
- As you can see.

321
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,193
There is a small accident on our show.

322
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,040
But don't worry. Everything is fine
We have it under control.

323
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,901
- Under control.
- We will see you back shortly after the break.

324
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,068
See you.

325
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,350
- Can you get up.
- Please help.

326
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,777
Oh! Slowly get him up
You okay?

327
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,235
- Slowly get up.
- Slowly.

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,943
Slowly. Calm down everyone
Peek, you okay?

329
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:53,735
Slowly get up.

330
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,235
Peek. Please take care of him
Watch the leg.

331
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:57,860
Watch his leg too.

332
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,984
Okay.

333
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,735
Let's take a short break.

334
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:03,900
Sure, sure. Come, come.

335
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,151
Okay.

336
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:06,900
Let's go everyone.

337
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,026
And, come.

338
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:09,900
And welcome back.

339
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:10,984
With Y Idol.

340
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,900
Everything is okay
Back to normal.

341
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:14,943
But now.

342
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,943
Let's get Dew's team back on stage.

343
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,360
Yes. Please come here
Come on.

344
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,151
You okay?

345
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,544
(You guys, here again. Whats happening)
(Don't tell me ...)

346
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,900
(He's in a wheelchair)(I pity him so much. This isn't a joke)
Peek, are you sure you are fine.

347
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,633
(Peek is in a wheelchair)
(Everyone please show some humanity)

348
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,260
(Why is he hurt now? He was fine dancing. Dance and then wheelchair)
Okay.

349
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,836
(If you are hurt, go rest, why are you on the show)(Who taught him acting?)
Right now, lets hear it from our judges.

350
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:30,316
(Teacher Vivian. I've seen pictures)
Yes.

351
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:33,652
(The student is better than the master)
Let's invite Dew, Tle and Heng from Nung Na Rong on stage.

352
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,235
Please come! Wohoo.

353
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,984
Hello, hello.

354
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,235
Hello.

355
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,235
How's it.

356
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,693
Watching the shows just now.

357
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,318
Dew, how do you feel.

358
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:45,777
After seeing all of them.

359
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,668
And Peek coming back on stage like this.

360
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:50,318
It's already tells everyone why is our team so good.

361
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,568
Umm

362
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:52,777
I agree.

363
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,068
On stage they are like this.

364
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,276
Imagine the time they were rehearsing.

365
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,572
How much support would they've given each other.

366
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
Really good job everyone.

367
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:01,527
Yes.

368
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,443
And I want to like.

369
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,610
Give a praise to especially Peek.

370
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:09,900
Because as we know, Peek was injured for almost half the week.

371
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:13,110
But he tried to practice with friends, dance with the team.

372
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,023
Hes a true fighter for me

373
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,351
I really respect him for that.

374
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:19,068
Good job.

375
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:25,350
Now, we have come to the moment to say that.

376
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Allow me to say.

377
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,586
The voting has been closed.

378
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:28,610
Yeah.

379
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,002
Votes are closed and
we will be announcing the winners soon.

380
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,984
Therefore, can we invite Dew, Tle and Heng.

381
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:34,730
Down the stage first.

382
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,984
Come on, lets go.

383
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,485
Thank you.

384
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,376
Oh!

385
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,860
Giving the teddy too. Yes.

386
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,900
And the winning team is?

387
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,276
Team?

388
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,235
P's Team.

389
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:09,485
Yay.

390
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,360
Wohoo.

391
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,443
You.

392
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Really well done.

393
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:17,163
And.

394
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,393
The person with.

395
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,185
The highest score from P' Team.

396
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,101
Who will be this week's winner.

397
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:23,602
Is.

398
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:26,643
Maybe it's you.

399
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:40,143
Kla.

400
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:51,486
Congratulations P's Team. Yes.

401
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,850
And.

402
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:54,060
Thank you everyone.

403
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,210
Thank you to all my team brothers.

404
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,040
And thank you to all the FC's.

405
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,685
And.

406
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,143
Peek, this week.

407
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,727
You've done really well.

408
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:06,602
This is for you too.

409
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:11,851
But hold on everyone.

410
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:15,160
This is not the end yet.

411
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:17,466
Because the person.

412
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:18,893
We are about to call.

413
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,430
We want you to step forward.

414
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:22,602
And that person is.

415
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Peek.

416
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
And.

417
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,435
This week, Peek.

418
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:36,435
Has proven that.

419
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,850
Where there is a will, there is really a way.

420
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,407
So we would like to give a special reward.

421
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,477
For the Best Fighter.

422
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,268
To Peek for this week.

423
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:46,810
Hey!

424
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:49,850
And of course, the Best Fighter award.

425
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:52,769
We have K. Tai from TTV to do the honours.

426
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,153
And present the award. Please K. Tai.

427
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,850
Hello.

428
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:02,643
Good job you.

429
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:07,769
Really amazing.

430
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,185
Keep fighting.

431
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:35,500
Huh.

432
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:36,976
How are you feeling.

433
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:38,934
Relieved?

434
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:40,810
Survived another week.

435
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,101
You are so lucky.

436
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:45,727
Peek.

437
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:47,976
Peek.

438
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:50,643
Time to go for check up.

439
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,369
(Y Idol Crew Where are you? Thanamin Hospital
(address) We are on trend 2 right now)

440
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,185
(Y Idol Crew Apologize to him to for pushing him to go on the show, tell him good job)(But is he really hurt?)

441
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:23,661
(Y Idol Crew Stupid Bank)(As soon as they reach, ask them to change There
will be a special live at home Take it to the end. This week is on fire)

442
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:25,976
(Next Week)
Be careful for the next week Peek.

443
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,934
The lesser the people know, the better.

444
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,134
You know how to play the game.

445
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Do you want even more spotlight?

446
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,310
How?

447
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,550
Yes.

448
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,083
I am worried about him.

449
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:04,900
(Kla, Harnkla Freelancer)

450
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,834
(Kla, Harnkla Freelancer)
This show is very important to him.

451
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,915
If he gets hurt and cannot compete.

452
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,922
I think he will be very sad.

453
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,539
(The whole house is tensed, what a pity)(Let's hope this is not just acting)
(Even if this is scripted, the worry still needs to be real.

454
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:20,350
(Here, here, here)(He's here)

455
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:20,875
How you feeling.

456
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:21,144
(Kla was the first to get to him. Cry)

457
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,168
How you feeling Peek.

458
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:23,931
Peek.

459
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:24,414
Hey.

460
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:24,784
Peek.

461
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:27,706
(Will there be any week that Peek doesn't create drama)
(Is Peek okay?)(Let's hope nothing happened to him)

462
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,730
Are you feeling okay?

463
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,283
What did the doctor say.

464
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:31,301
(Achi is acting very weird)

465
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,075
Can you continue to compete.

466
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,619
(Can you compete, its like he wants him out of the competition)

467
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,617
(Peek seems like he wants to slap Achi, something's off with these two)
It's muscle sprain.

468
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,658
Must be from the rehearsals and putting strain on the ankle.

469
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:38,925
(At least it's not broken)

470
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,241
Oh! But luckily.

471
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:40,517
(Don't do this again, take care of yourself)

472
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,124
The muscle did not tear or bone did not break.

473
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:42,676
(True. If its broke, he will have to leave the show)

474
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:42,964
Sigh.

475
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,285
(Want to see Achi push Peek off the stairs. Juicy)

476
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:44,583
Yes.

477
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:45,596
(Peek, fighting. You can do it)

478
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,495
Everyone.

479
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,017
(Let's trend #Peekissick)

480
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,291
Take care of him for this week.

481
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:48,975
(Please, Achi's FC don't be mean like your main)
(My main is good, main wants spotlight. So obvious he wants attention)

482
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:49,915
For sure.

483
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:50,652
(They love each other like family. Cry!)

484
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:50,925

485
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,601
(Family, huh)

486
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,625
(What a fake family)
This week.

487
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,333
I will take care of you, everything fro you bro.

488
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,518
(Everyone, I'm gonna cry seeing Earth speak)

489
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,542
Okay?

490
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,934
(So cute, love their friendship.)
Everything bro?

491
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,392
(I love their brotherhood more than them trying for the competition At least Peek is smiling now) Yea. Feeding him too? Yes.

492
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:03,166
(So cute!)
No problem at all.

493
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,999
Hey! Korn.

494
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,800
What are you doing here.

495
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:11,999
Can't sleep too.

496
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:12,999
Yeah.

497
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,458
I'm stressed.

498
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,708
The more I think of the team
The more stressed I am.

499
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,500
I feel like I am the burden.

500
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,375
Hey, you.

501
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,625
Why are you stressed.

502
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,375
If the team doesn't make any mistake.

503
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,958
You will defnitely win.

504
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:27,050
That's why.

505
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,416
The more I think, the more pressured I am.

506
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:30,834
Ow.

507
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,250
I'm going to bed.

508
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,416
See you.

509
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,976
Be careful this week, Peek.

510
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,958
Everyone, lets all go rest.

511
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay.

512
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,750
Sure. You guys.

513
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,250
Please take care of him.

514
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,434
Yes. I will take care of that.

515
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:16,834
Then.

516
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,834
Let's celebrate for Kla and Peek.

517
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,750
Yes, since we are already back.

518
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,475
Yeah, since we are already back anyway.

519
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,750
Let's do something.

520
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:25,875
I want to rest today.

521
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:27,667
Feeling tired.

522
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:28,076
Hey.

523
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:28,915
Hey.

524
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,291
Then lets rest.

525
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:31,958
Let Peek go rest.

526
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,083
Yes Peek, go rest up.

527
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:33,667
Kla.

528
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:34,708
Go with him.

529
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:35,915
Yeah.

530
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,083
Let me go drop him.

531
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:37,667
Okay.

532
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,166
Okay.

533
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,716
Take care of him.

534
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,841
Go fast and come fast.

535
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:44,593
No need for a chair anymore.

536
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:53,696
Sigh.

537
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,198
Good that there is nothing wrong.

538
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:56,119
Umm

539
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,625
I was so worried.

540
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,250
I felt pity His leg was swollen.

541
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:03,915
You, damn.

542
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,436
I was really tensed about what would happen today.

543
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:11,915
At first.

544
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,255
I thought you would pack your things and leave.

545
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,608
But if you choose to come this way.

546
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,458
You have to act smoothly.

547
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,667
If you get caught.

548
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,750
You will be asked to leave.

549
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:41,958
Since last night?

550
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:47,888
Why didn't you tell me.

551
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,105
Lesser the people know, the better.

552
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,458
Peek

553
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:01,975
I think it's a bit too much.

554
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,139
You, you had to create such a big scene?

555
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,375
Everyone needs a selling point to create a story.

556
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,291
Isn't it true.

557
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,542
It is.

558
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,792
But you can create other stories as well.

559
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,333
Next time don't do this.

560
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,705
Hurting yourself like this.

561
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,083
If I don't do, I will have to leave the show.

562
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,583
Achi will definitely tell someone.

563
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,915
You wanted to win with me right?

564
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:37,958
Even if I had to do more.

565
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,792
I will do it.

566
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,333
I respect you man.

567
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,523
You already know how to play a game.

568
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,625
Peek.

569
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,250
This week.

570
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,602
You were in the spotlight.

571
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,083
Peek.

572
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,114
Do you want even more spotlight?

573
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,583
How?

574
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,377
(Y Idol Crew)(If this was in a series, we'll get thousands of shares? Why didn't you set up cameras? What did I do wrong to deserve this?)

575
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,910
(Y Idol Crew)(I don't know what I'm doing here)(Maybe even buffalos will be able to guess whats going on)(Answer me)

576
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,212
(Y Idol Crew)(I don't know what to say to you. Even buffalos help produce rice, what about you guys? Answer. Okay, never mind. Don't answer. You only work normal office hours, I'll remember that.)

577
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,236
(Next Break)
Oh yeah.

578
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,369
They got the badge too.

579
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,583
He won even without winning.

580
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,291
This week.

581
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,542
It is Most's turn

582
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,125
I'm telling you.

583
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,708
Aren't we going to do a live.

584
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,083
Why do they have to go and change clothes.

585
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:43,250
Peek and Kla.

586
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,062
Is it okay if your friends play along?

587
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:46,426
I'm fine with anything.

588
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,322
Are you going to hide from me until the competition ends.

589
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,148
You think I don't feel uncomfortable?

590
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,215
If you are uncomfortable, then don't force it.

591
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,589
Hmm.

592
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,266
Umm.

593
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,550
What the hell.

594
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:42,747
Who are you dreaming of.

595
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:44,496
Making such loud noises.

596
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:45,162
Come here.

597
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:46,490
Hey. Nothing.

598
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,810
Or?

599
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,163
Hey.

600
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:53,319
Nothing, nothing.

601
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,052
Who are you dreaming of.

602
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,537
Kla, hey Kla.

603
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,204
Kla, where you going?
Kla.

604
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:01,204
Oh, who were you dreaming of
You haven't told us.

605
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,370
- Hey.
- Making such loud moaning noise.

606
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,287
Umm.

607
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,912
The cracker looks good.

608
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:49,037
Do you want to eat?

609
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,329
Let's go and take some more.

610
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,212
You haven't eaten.

611
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:22,583
Looks good.

612
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,788
Hey! Give me some too

613
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:26,078
I'm done, going to take some more.

614
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:27,329
Taking two more?

615
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:31,454
Thank you.

616
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:41,912
Korn.

617
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,579
I will tell you for the last time.

618
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:45,719
Yeah.

619
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:47,967
And I will tell you for the last time too.

620
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,324
Fried eggs are to be eaten with fish sauce / ketchup.

621
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,995
How is it good with ketchup. It's needs fish sauce.

622
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:55,329
It's tastier.

623
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:56,662
Don't fight.

624
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:59,696
And what is it, having fried eggs with like fish sauce.

625
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:01,543
It's smelly. And stale too.

626
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:02,953
Have you tried it before

627
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,662
I told you to try so many times.

628
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:09,356
Hey, Kla.

629
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:10,976
Last night.

630
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,287
Really good job.

631
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:14,746
Congrats bro.

632
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:16,079
Amazing.

633
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,287
Thank you bro.

634
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:21,345
Hey, Peek.

635
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:22,587
Aha.

636
00:38:22,912 --> 00:38:23,912
You were good too.

637
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,412
What a scene to remember.

638
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:26,928
Sitting on a wheelchair on stage.

639
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:29,920
Right now the trend must be on top of Kla's.

640
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:31,842
Right.

641
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:32,953
And got the badge too.

642
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,195
You won even though you didn't win.

643
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:37,995
Yeah.

644
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,329
It's almost the same.

645
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:41,109
When people have badge.

646
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,621
And I don't.

647
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,412
It's so obvious.

648
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:46,343
That I haven't won anything.

649
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,598
I'm starting to think like.

650
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:49,622
What do I do.

651
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,429
To find a scene.

652
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:51,913
To do something too.

653
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:53,163
This week.

654
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,329

Kla and Peek.

658
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,723
Go and change. Wear something comfortable.

659
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:03,808
What? Gate.

660
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:06,412
Aren't we going to go live.

661
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:08,950
Why do they have to go change.

662
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,746
Oh.

663
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,621

00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,579
So Pond wants them to.

672

Play a game together for their FC.

673
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:29,912

688
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:01,329
They are playing just 2 of them.

689
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:04,287
Yes, yes. We want to play too.

690
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:06,662

693
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:11,869
Peek and Kla.

694
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,479
Is it okay if your friends play too

695
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,950
I am okay with anything.

696
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:18,162
Will Pond be okay?

697
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:20,746
Please Gate. Okay.

698
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:22,120
Then.

699
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:23,746
Everyone can play.

700
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:24,953
Yes.

701
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:27,995
Go, go and change.

702
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:29,579
What are you waiting for.

703
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:29,976
Go.

704
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,568
Change change. Go quick.

705
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,063
You're so dead Gateway.

706
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:37,245
Doomed.

707
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:39,652
The front line are happy but the back end are suffering.

708
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:41,162
My work experience.

709
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:42,791
My many years of working in the industry

710
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,343
I can't lose my job now.

711
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,043
Hello, hello, hello everyone.

712
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,869
Every Sunday afternoon, we are back with

713
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:04,953
Seoul Say once again.

714
00:41:05,204 --> 00:41:06,746
With the show.

715
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,869
Waii Jai Y Idol.

716
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,179
(Waii Jai Y Idol)

717
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,454
Do we have to play this big.

718
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,013
Do we have to play this big.

719
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:18,079
But you, are there only 3 of you today?

720
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:20,704
Crazy. How can we just come 3 of us.

721
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:21,744
And where are the other 3?

722
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:24,869
We are here.

723
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:28,706
Okay, today

724
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,621
I have a special equipment.

725
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,030
Where did it come from. Oops.

726
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,953
To help you release stress.

727
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:34,870
Today

728
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,746
Seoul Say and the show have a game.

729
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,621
For this game, we will let the pairs,
put the ball on their forehead.

730
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,329
You can walk any how you want.

731
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,203
And come up.

732
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:46,750
Pick the flag from me.

733
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,869
Which pair gets the flag first.

734
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:52,496
That pair will get the special privilege for this week.

735
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:55,245
Again? Special privilege again?

736
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,849
(Rule for Y Jai Y Idol)(For this week, Idols need to work in pairs
They will have to keep the ball between their foreheads)

737
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:03,030
(Idols need to walk with the ball to get the flag from Seoul Say)(The pair that drops the ball will be disqualified)(The pair that gets the flag first will get privilege for this week)

738
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,055
(If ready, hold on tight to your partners
And Let's go!)

739
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:06,556
If everyones ready.

740
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,995
Let's Go!

741
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:11,995
Calm down, calm down.

742
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,120
Calm down, Most.

743
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,412
Don't step on my foot.

744
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:17,579
Yeah, I won't.

745
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,623
Peek

746
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:23,912
I'm going to lift you.

747
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:25,412
No.

748
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,146
Do you want the special privilege?

749
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,788
Well!

750
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,579
Were you shy that time.

751
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:33,662
You face was so close to Kla. You became quiet.

752
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:34,995
What are you saying

753
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,829
I wasn't shy

754
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,273
I was scared the ball would fall.

755
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:38,704
Really?

756
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,120
But I think you were blushing.

757
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:42,162
Left.

758
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:42,829
Calm down.

759
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:43,537
Left first bro.

760
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:44,162
Ow.

761
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:46,037
Your left or my left. Left.

762
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:47,663
Oye!

763
00:42:47,704 --> 00:42:49,287
You stepped on my foot, Korn.

764
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:50,454
Really? Sorry.

765
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,537
Here they come.

766
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:52,995
Quickly. Come on.

767
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:01,869
Wow.

768
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,162
Here it is.

769
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:04,454
Here it is now.

770
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:07,410
Peek, play the game not stare at each other.

771
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:10,162
Oh.

772
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:14,329
Yay.

773
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:15,537
Well.

774
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:17,746
Everyone, after the last game.

775
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:19,037
With the ball.

776
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:21,329
We had 2 winners.

777
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:22,537
Kla and Peek.

778
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:24,454
Now they will have to compete.

779
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,621
To be the best idol.
That person will receive this weeks privilege.

780
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,162
And the game they have to play is. Twister.

781
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:37,704
Come on.

782
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:38,754
For this game.

783
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,912
Who ever drops first.

784
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,912
That person loses.

785
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,079
And the strongest person will get the privilege.

786
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:47,953
Come.

787
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:49,343
Next

788
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,746
I'm going to spin this.

789
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,782
You will do as I say.

790
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:54,843
Ready?

791
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,496
Kla, Peek. Yes.

792
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:58,245
Okay, if you are ready.

793
00:43:58,953 --> 00:43:59,953
Ah.

794
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:02,120
Kla, your turn.

795
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,254
Put your right hand.

796
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:06,338
At the red.

797
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,581
- Oh.
- Hey.

798
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:38,245
He lost.

799
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,120
He fell.

800
00:44:39,245 --> 00:44:40,412
So the winner is.

801
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:41,287
Here.

802
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,412
Our winner.

803
00:44:42,537 --> 00:44:44,995
Congratulations Peek.

804
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:50,704
Everyone wants to know now
What the privilege is.

805
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:51,912
Do you want to know?

806
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,204
Let's meet with our Y bro tomorrow
All I can say is.

807
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:58,337
He's popular. He's handsome
And he's one of the top in the industry.

808
00:44:58,684 --> 00:44:58,849
Yeah.

809
00:44:59,162 --> 00:44:59,829
Whats it going to be.

810
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,496
Wait to find out tomorrow.

811
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:02,454
For today.

812
00:45:02,712 --> 00:45:03,712
That's all.

813
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:05,329
Bye.

814
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,029
What the hecks wrong with you.

815
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:25,976
Are you going to hide from me
until the end of the competition.

816
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:29,869
I'm not hiding.

817
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:32,532
Peek.

818
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:34,662
Can you act normal.

819
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:37,579
It's not easy for me either.

820
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,449
Seriously Peek.

821
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:47,684
You think I don't feel uncomfortable.

822
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,672
If you feel uncomfortable
Then don't force it.

823
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:54,963
Didn't you hear what Seoul said.

824
00:45:56,245 --> 00:45:56,704
This week.

825
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:58,239
We're going to work in pairs.

826
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,523
So what.

827
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:03,113
You and me are going to have to work together.

828
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:14,419
Really.

829
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,220
(Y Bro Nunew Chawarin Perdpiriyawong)

830
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,704
The winner of Y Idol.

831
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,704
Will have to work together as the new ship in the industry.

832
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:43,621
And this week.

833
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,287
Everyone will be working in pairs.

834
00:46:45,995 --> 00:46:47,454
Feelings of working in pairs.

835
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:51,454
And expressing it to the other person is very important.

836
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:52,788
And there is no better way.

837
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:56,869
To express feelings better than singing.

838
00:46:56,953 --> 00:46:58,454
We will let you choose the song.

839
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,683
And rehearse yourself.

840
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:02,454
There will be a singing teacher and a mentor helping you.

841
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,869
The pair that does the best, wins.

842
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,287
And the person.

843
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,370
Who gets the highest vote from the two.

844
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,204
Will be the winner of the week.

845
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,037
Everyone.

846
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,330
From that task, you can already know what to do.

847
00:47:15,995 --> 00:47:16,995
It's possible.

848
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:18,245
The partner you choose.

849
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:19,995
Will get your FC's attention.

850
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:21,995
And cheer for you until the final week.

851
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:29,203
Let's come to the privilege.

852
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,412
From the winner of Waii Jai Y Idol.

853
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:36,788
Peek, will be able to choose his partner first.

854
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:38,245
From P' Team.

855
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:39,782
Before everyone else.

856
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,624
I'm shocked.

857
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:44,403
This privilege. Isn't it too privileged?

858
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:45,856
I think he will choose Kla.

859
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,420
And Achi will pick Most.

860
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:49,379
And I.

861
00:47:49,463 --> 00:47:50,950
Will have to be partners with Earth.

862
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,869
If I had such an advantage

863
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,454
I will pick the best singer.

864
00:47:57,953 --> 00:48:00,621
Peek must be leaving the people he doesn't like to work together.

865
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,370
If hes really playing a game.

866
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,477
(Y Idol Crew)(Ask your mother to come back. He's acting childish)(This is something but we are on live reality show guys. They are doing it for the rating.)(Boss, I know this is against your ideals, but it's a reality show. TTV does it for the rating, so when they start in a series, it'll be popular or else he won't have to create a show.)

867
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,971
(Y Idol Crew)(You're not here to change the industry, you're here to work)(I understand you, but the investors and industry won't change, what can you do?)(I understand)(Do what they say, one day when you have power, you can decide)

868
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:19,120
(Next Week)
They do as though I don't have any value.

869
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:21,623
You have value Peek.

870
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,490
At least.

871
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:27,662
For me.

872
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,162
And the person Peek chose as his partner is?
