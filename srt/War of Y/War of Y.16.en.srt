00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,288
Sign this document before starting the shoot.

150
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,533
P

151
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,733
What kind of contract is this?

152
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,266
About the costume and hair is okay.

153
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:03,507
I understand.

154
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,600
But this one.

155
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,888
We're not allowed to date?

156
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,377
And that too.

157
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,511
For 2 years. Isn't it too long?

158
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,822
You are a Y series actor, right?

159
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,888
When the series ends,

160
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,377
you still have to work with Korn.

161
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,413
But what if...

162
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,311
you have a boyfriend or girlfriend.

163
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,644
Won't it be unfair to Korn?

164
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,711
In that case,

165
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
can we just become a couple?

166
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:43,577
Easy.

167
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:48,673
Most, listen to me.

168
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,288
Let this be only acting.

169
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,622
P

170
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,288
I've finished signing.

171
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,222
Can I go home?

172
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,755
Anyone who has finished signing, can leave first.

173
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,022
Thank you.

174
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:33,540
(YPoll)
(How would you feel? If an actor
has a boyfriends or girlfriend while promoting the series)

175
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:37,553
(YPoll)
(1. Feel nothing)
(2. Not okay)

176
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,755
(Next Break)
Hi.

177
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,222
I'm Fern.

178
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,200
I know you all.

179
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,653
- Did you watch Y Idol?
- I did

180
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:45,793
I voted too.

181
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,644
Can we interview please?

182
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,280
Most and Achi, how are you feeling

183
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:13,488
to play your first series
that is converted from a legendary novel?

184
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,640
I am very excited.

185
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,940
And feel very challenged

186
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,660
I have to make the novel readers believe
that I am the character.

187
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,920
But I can do it.

188
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,540
I will do my best.

189
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,330
Please support me.

190
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,450
Did you see the news of Kla and Peek

191
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,250
debuting with Ruam Dao Bangkok?

192
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,400
The reason that those two did not play the series.

193
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,860
Is it because of this?

194
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:41,800
No.

195
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,580
I choose the characters based on their match with the role.

196
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,190
What about other actors?

197
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,822
How do you feel about
Kla and Peek's debut with Ruam Dao?

198
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:53,711
Really?

199
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,460
I just came to know from you.

200
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,020
I am happy for them.

201
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,340
Because Ruam Dao is very big and produce quality stars.

202
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:06,040
I will wait to see their performances.

203
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,540
I hope I get to see it soon.

204
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,920
Any case, I need to take them back now.

205
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,688
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

206
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:29,127

(Please, I really love this novel. Don't turn it into a series)
(Actors do not match the character)
(The producer is creating publicity for the main couple.)
(So obvious If I'm the writer, I won't be okay)

208
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,643
(Writer)

209
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:58,422
Hello.

210
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:01,222
It's me, P.

211
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,180
Korn, can you take a picture for me?

212
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:13,200
Picture again?
Hey, I want to take picture too.

213
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,820
I want solo picture.

214
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,247
Let's take together first.

215
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:19,647
Most.

216
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,190
- You too.
- Woo.

217
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:23,500
Get out.

218
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,090
What man?

219
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,820
Will I get a picture alone?

220
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,627
Frowning again.

221
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,090
You'll look old.

222
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,350
Listen to this song.

223
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,830
Most, I'm reading.

224
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,240
Listen first.

225
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,380
You promised.

226
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:55,666
Quick.

227
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,711
I just came to know.

228
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,840
Listening to rock song while reading
It's good.

229
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,644
I told you

230
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:21,355
1,2,3

231
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,111
Ouch.

232
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,593
Watch your step.

233
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,222
Sorry.

234
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:32,600
It hurts.

235
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,480
But walk ways are for walking.

236
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,266
Oh you.

237
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,777
Come here.

238
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:44,533
Yes.

239
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,690
Go change into this shirt.

240
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,022
Okay.

241
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:00,977
So cool.

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,380
Boys.

243
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:15,700
Are you all ready?

244
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:19,620
Ready? And what are you still going here?
Go, go on to the sets.

245
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,430
Quick. Go work.

246
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,370
- Most, was your shirt is like this?
- Yes.

247
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,422
Well, okay.

248
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,140
Hey, its not your scene yet.

249
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:28,355
You can come change later.

250
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,022
Okay.

251
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,480
- Why didn't you rehearse at home?
- You're doomed.

252
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:38,540
- Don't be too sure...
- They will...

253
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,422
Hi.

254
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:47,866
I'm Fern.

255
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:51,910
Hi.

256
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,330
- I am Korn...
- No need to introduce yourself.

257
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,320
I know you all.

258
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,222
Korn.

259
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,133
Earth.

260
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:06,644
Most.

261
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:08,333
Achi.

262
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,200
And?

263
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:14,466
I'm Naksueb.

264
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm Shell, also actor in the series.

265
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:21,820
How do you know us?

266
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,266
- Did you watch Y Idol?
- I did.

267
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:30,844
I even voted.

268
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:31,800
Ahem

269
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,260
I'll let you confess.

270
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,840
You voted for me right?

271
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:45,000
Boys, go on to the sets. Go, hurry.

272
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:48,111
- It's work time Most.
- Yes.

273
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,244
Yeah.

274
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,480
Wait a moment.

275
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:51,940
- Yes?
- Let me see...

276
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:54,500
Makeup, hair.

277
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:56,200
Come see to Achi.

278
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,690
This way. Go this way.

279
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:58,866
Fern.

280
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,060
- You can go wait over there first.
- Okay.

281
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:15,933
Okay.

282
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,888
Ready?

283
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:18,530
- Yes.
- Ready?

284
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:19,755
Quick recheck.

285
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,700
Everyone knows how to play the skateboard right.

286
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,120
Anyone who doesn't?

287
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:27,577
I don't know how to play.

288
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:28,733
Hey?

289
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,577
Tookta.

290
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,022
Yes.

291
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:37,430
Didn't we send them to learn skateboard.

292
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,111
How come they don't know how to play.

293
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:41,733
Their schedule was too tight.

294
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,555
Tight schedule huh.

295
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Sigh!

296
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:53,111
Let's do this. Those who don't know
just try to balance straight.

297
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:54,911
Okay? For those who can play, just play.

298
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,850
Alright. Let's go.

299
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,820
Go into positions. Quick.

300
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:02,680
Standby.

301
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,910
Just balance yourself
to make it go forward. Slowly.

302
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,200
- Like this?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:16,940
I think that's enough.

304
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:20,280
- Yeah enough.
- Just basics are okay.

305
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:23,120
Come on. Let's go. Ready.

306
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,140
And Action.

307
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,911
Do you want to play?

308
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:38,844
I will teach you.

309
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:41,688
Yeah.

310
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh careful.

311
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:52,800
Gosh...

312
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:55,933
Cut, cut, cut.

313
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,133
Here.

314
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,066
Achi, are you okay?

315
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,666
Yes.

316
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:10,822
Alright

317
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:14,320
I want it again From the start.

318
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,733
Seriously?

319
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,610
From the start?

320
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,910
Yeah, from the start. Achi, okay right?

321
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:25,830
In positions. Come on, quicker.

322
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,200
You can do it.

323
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:35,180
Okay, ready.

324
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,070
And Action.

325
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,422
Do you want to play?

326
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:53,822
I will teach you.

327
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,266
Yeah.

328
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:11,444
Cut.

329
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,244
Achi, come down first.

330
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:26,555
Seriously.

331
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:29,044
You feeling okay? You can do it right?

332
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,288
I am fine.

333
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,970
Can I have another chance please Mike?

334
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,088
One more time.

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,311
- Okay?
- Yes.

336
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:48,460
Lets do this. You all can go break first.
I will focus just on them.

337
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,844
Yeah, everyone can go out of the set.

338
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,110
Fighting. Come on.

339
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:02,133
Here.

340
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:10,650
And Action.

341
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:19,000
Do you want to play?

342
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,511
I will teach you.

343
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,066
Yeah.

344
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:34,470
I will teach you how to skate board, do you want to learn?

345
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,740
He looks weak, will he be able to play.

346
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:45,140
Cut. Cut first.

347
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:49,920
Come here. Everyone.

348
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,040
Let's do this.

349
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:01,240
I will pause this scene for now.

350
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,520
We will do a reshoot later.

351
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,680
Yeah. Don't think too much.

352
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:11,640
Let's go. Change and take rest. Go.

353
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,400
Hey.

354
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:26,244
It's okay.

355
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,844
That’s enough.

356
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:51,044
It's alright.

357
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,300
It's nothing serious
We can do it again.

358
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,967
(YPoll)
(What is the most important for
an actor before the series go on air?)

359
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,444
(YPoll)
(1. Go on events to create FC base)
(2. Learn more acting skills)

360
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:10,013
Do Y couples...
need to be sweet off screen too?

361
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:13,444
Don't tell me, the person you voted for is?

362
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:14,733
Little bear.

363
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,622
And who do you like more, Achi or me?

364
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Is he okay?

365
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,288
You and Korn can leave first.

366
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,555
I will see to him.

367
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Take care of him.

368
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,977
We will leave first.

369
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,666
See you.

370
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,911
Here.

371
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,377
The chef in the kitchen made this.

372
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
It's delicious.

373
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,088
Thanks.

374
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
They've all left.

375
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,688
I'm sorry about that scene.

376
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,888
Why are you saying sorry?

377
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,720
You've done all the other scenes really well.

378
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Can I ask.

379
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,377
What happened during that scene.

380
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,955
Anything I can help?

381
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,780
You won't be able to help.

382
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,733
Ofcourse I can.

383
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,244
I can rehearse with you.

384
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,844
Never mind.

385
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:37,933
Hey.

386
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,111
I'm serious. I can help.

387
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,088
What's wrong?

388
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:49,640
Is the shirt too hot?

389
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,800
Or...

390
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,200
The AC is not cool?

391
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,986
- Or are you feeling itchy?
- Stop it.

392
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,133
If you're done for the day, you can...

393
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,933
go back to rest first.

394
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,533
Here.

395
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
You. Can I eat it?

396
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,480
If you're hungry
You shouldn't give your food to others.

397
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,444
Then can I eat it.

398
00:29:29,244 --> 00:29:30,533
It's yours anyway.

399
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,555
Try it.

400
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,488
Is it good?

401
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,688
Eat and stop being sad.

402
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,840
Okay, come on
I will take you to your seat. Follow me.

403
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,080
Here you go.

404
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,822
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

405
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,644
Can I have 2 bowls of noodles?

406
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:25,444
Wait.

407
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:28,133
Aren’t you going to ask me what I want.

408
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,333
I already know.

409
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,733
Yeah!

410
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,533
Fern.

411
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:40,666
- Oh.
- Hey.

412
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,320
You are here too.

413
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,840
Yeah

414
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,533
I saw a lot of people
So I thought of trying it.

415
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,688
See.

416
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,288
Everyone thinks like this.

417
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,440
More people means it's good.

418
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,022
But if its not good...

419
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
We'll see.

420
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
What are you having.

421
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:02,206
Thank you.

422
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,400
Do you want to add anything?

423
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:10,822
Which one

424
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I want chilli.

425
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,511
Don't add too much chilli.

426
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,688
It's spicy.

427
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:24,333
Here. Give it to me.

428
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:29,288
Do Y couples
have to sweet off screen as well?

429
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,511
Shippers will get a heart attack.

430
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Don't tell me.

431
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:41,400
The person you voted for in Y Idol is?

432
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:42,888
Little bear
(Most and Achi's FC name)

433
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:43,911
Hey.

434
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,311
Really?

435
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:47,333
Yes, really.

436
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,666
She turns out to be our FC.

437
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,000
I am Y fan.

438
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,955
I watch all the series.

439
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,866
The ones Achi played too
I've watched it before.

440
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,280
And who do you like more, Most or Achi?

441
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,176
You are shipped as a couple
so I have to like both equally.

442
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,555
Here.

443
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Yeah.

444
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Hey.

445
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,444
Have you tried it

446
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I already tried.

447
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,866
Hows it? Is it good?

448
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,080
- It's spicy.
- I told you not to add too much chilli.

449
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,666
Don't eat.

450
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Add some sugar into it.

451
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Is your tongue burning?

452
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,866
- A little.
- I will blow it for you.

453
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,155
Pull your tongue out.

454
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Bring it out.

455
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,120
Out, yeah.

456
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
It's spicy.

457
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,155
Because its spicy, I will blow it for you.

458
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
What?

459
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Is it better.

460
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,644
Hey.

461
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Don't shoot.

462
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,555
- Why not?
- Fern, I'm embarrassed.

463
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,888
Your moments together are so cute.

464
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,711
Then lets take a group photo.

465
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,840
Come on.

466
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
Say SS The Series.

467
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,400
- Okay?
- Yes.

468
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,920
One, two, three.

469
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,080
SS The Series.

470
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,022
Did it capture?

471
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,355
It's in night mode.

472
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,288
- Eat properly.
- It's tasty.

473
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,280
Isn't it.

474
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:48,826
(Fern Nattha: Little bear got to meet the captain)
(#MostAchi'slittlebear)(#SSTheSeries)

475
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,253
Let me give you an acting tip.

476
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:13,577
When acting, you need to be reborn.

477
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:16,111
When the director says action.

478
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,240
Cut.

479
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,940
- You are not you.
- Well done.

480
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,860
Well done.

481
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,888
You have to leave everything behind.

482
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,711
And be reborn as the character.

483
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:25,133
Wow. It was really good.

484
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,977
Good.

485
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,200
Yes, very well done.

486
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,120
Fantastic.

487
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,340
Not yet. No hugging yet.

488
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,870
Yeah. That's more like it
Very well done.

489

You've done so well, don't worry
There will be a reward.

No, no, not for you guys yet
Massage me first.

Massage, yes. Just like that.

Well done.

Can I have some?

From here right?

I lost the club's money.

Can I get a kiss?

623
00:45:40,777 --> 00:45:43,390
Move your lips and swallow your saliva.

624
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,380
Lower your gaze and slowly look up.

625
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:54,140
Smile seductively.

626
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:56,930
Close your eyes.

627
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,155
Put your face close to each other.

628
00:45:58,377 --> 00:45:59,640

630
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,380
Lean back and open chest wide.

631
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:07,955
Count one.

632
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,688
Two.

633
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:10,500
Three.

634
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,555
And open the eyes.

635
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:15,488
Hold the pose to wait for the camera to capture.

636
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:20,200
Cut, cut, cut.

637
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:27,200
Ah. Yeah.

638
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:29,622
Umm.

639
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,088
Are you okay?

640
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,680
Did you, want me to change anything Mike?

641
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:49,520
Well
Overall, actually it was okay.

642
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:53,200
But I feel like, like there was like...

643
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:57,400
A worry or stress or...

644
00:46:57,777 --> 00:47:00,440
But it, it was good.

645
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:01,880
Or I am overthinking?

646
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, I think its just me.

647
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:05,080
But don't worry

648
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:09,520
I can do the editing here and there
If there’s anything, I can edit it.

649
00:47:09,555 --> 00:47:11,520
No problem. You both did good.

650
00:47:11,577 --> 00:47:13,080
It's just me, over thinking.

651
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:15,200
Yeah, there was something.

652
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:18,560
But no need to worry
It's all okay.

653
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:23,800
You both did well
Yeah, go change for the next scene.

654
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:31,040
I think you played the scene really well.

655
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:36,088
But if Mike says that,
there must be something.

656
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Oh.

657
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:43,680
Is this your dialogue?

658
00:47:48,444 --> 00:47:51,120
Honestly, writing in detail is good.

659
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,680
But you need to feel it too.

660
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:59,000
How does Note feel when kissing Pao?
Can you feel it?

661
00:48:02,644 --> 00:48:05,560
Don't only kiss because its in the script.

662
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:08,400
But...

663
00:48:09,244 --> 00:48:10,360
You should feel like...

664
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:15,200
Note and Pao are kissing
Because they love each other.

665
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:17,320
And kissing is normal.

666
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:18,977
Ok.

667
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:30,560
Or should we kiss more often?

668
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:36,120
Hey, I think that's a great idea.

669
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:40,200
Kiss more often so you get used to it.

670
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:41,466
Enough.

671
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,840
Let's do this.

672
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,120
- Let's play a game.
- Sure.

673
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,720
The person who says a word that ends with 'n' first loses
And needs to kiss the other person.

674
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,720
No. There are a lot of words
that ends with n.

675
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:56,466
Isn't it good?

676
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,155
So you can kiss often.

677
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,490
I will lose just calling your name.

678
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:06,680
Come on. Lets go.

679
00:49:07,022 --> 00:49:08,280
Hey. Wait.

680
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,000
There was N in that.

681
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,311
Game has started?

682
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:14,800
Yes, starting now.

683
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:16,160
Go.

684
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,160
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

685
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,440
Most, who asked you to use tongue.

686
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:36,760
Tongue.

687
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:40,640
But this time, you need to kiss first.

688
00:49:51,444 --> 00:49:52,880
Are you feeling less stressed.

689
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,600
Good if you are feeling better.

690
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,480
Go.

691
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:03,177
I only said go.

692
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,240
Careful.

693
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,066
Want to go have noodles at the same shop?

694
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:18,066
I can't.

695
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:20,760
- You guys go.
- Why not.

696
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:23,360
I have to go somewhere.

697
00:50:25,844 --> 00:50:26,866
At this time?

698
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,977
Yeah.

699
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:30,088
It's fine.

700
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:32,390
Go on. I will go next time.

701
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,233
Go, go. Go together.

702
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:51,644
I think we need to talk.

703
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:54,866
Since we have to be together for a long time.

704
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,377
I think.

705
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,177
We should be more real with each other.

706
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:03,240
I will be myself around you.

707
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:06,266
And you have to be yourself with me.

708
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,266
Okay?

709
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,355
If anything, we should talk.

710
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:14,666
Yeah.

711
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:16,044
I feel.

712
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:17,933
We need to sync with each other.

713
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,955
If we can sync 100 percent,

714
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:26,520
We can play any scene without any trouble.

715
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:28,911
Right?

716
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:31,200
Yes.

717
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:36,320
And imagine.

718
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:39,080
If I feel the way, I am feeling now.

719
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:41,311
Feeling what?

720
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,790
I was just going to pick it up.

721
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,177
Crazy.

722
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,644
Whats happening on the sets?

723
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,600
It's normal.

724
00:52:58,266 --> 00:52:59,266
Are you sure?

725
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:01,511
Yes.

726
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:07,511
Keep a close look.

727
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,711
I don't want anyone breaking the contract.

728
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,800
And thank you very much.

729
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:15,755
For creating publicity for Most and Achi.

730
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:19,911
They will be able to work together for a long time.

731
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,106
(YPoll)
(When celebrities watch Y series, you think...)

732
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,688
(YPoll)
(1. They really watch it)
(2. Creating publicity)

733
00:53:45,844 --> 00:53:47,960
(Next Week)
Just now Achi was in character.

734
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:49,880
I sometimes feel that...

735
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:51,440
Achi might be...

736
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,688
I feel that not a lot of Y novel talks
about this type of folk drama.

737
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:59,470
If I don't do it differently
How can I compete with other big firms.

738
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,177
This is New, another one of our series director.

739
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:06,288
Y series these days doesn't care
about the plot. Is it true?

740
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:09,444
Only kiss or NC's are enough.
