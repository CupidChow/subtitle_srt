How did you know?

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,755
I asked her to share her location before.

54
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,911
A girl staying alone is dangerous.

55
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,209
Hell yeah.

Hello.

59
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,246
- Where are you?
- No need to call, I'm here.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,688
- Okay.
- Oh?

61
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,911
You came too?

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,288

66
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,290
Or do you wanna?

67
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,155
Hey.

Stop fighting you two.

69
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,066
Here, have medicine with warm water.

70
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,777
So you will be fine soon.

71
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,777
Only medicine is fine too.

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,155
No need for warm water.

73
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, okay.

74
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,422

I'm with you guys
because I want to get famous, isn't it right?

I don't know what to say.

100
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,483
If an actor doesn't want publicity,

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,711
then what would they want?

102
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
No need to care.

103
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,876

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,111
Oh yeah.

166
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Alright everyone.

167
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,333
Let's prepare for the show.

168
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:41,626
The media are here.

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,466
One, two, three.

170
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:14,887
Smile please.

171
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,688
One, two.

172
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,688
Sorry.

173
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,244
Sorry. Excuse me.

174
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,933
Excuse me.

175
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:30,626
Oh, Net.

176
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:35,593
I haven't seen you in a while.

177
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
You look beautiful today.

178
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,244
Yeah.

179
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,688
Thanks.

180
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:55,977
Hello.

181
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,666
My name is James.

182
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,250
He's my new ship.

183
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,488
Let's go

184
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,955
(#YPoll)
( the word "beautiful",
can be used with a male actor? Yes or no)

185
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,087
(Next Break)
Just now Achi was very in character.

186
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,088
It made me wonder.

187
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,542
If Achi is?

188
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,933
Is gay?

189
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
If I'm gay, so what?

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,711
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
My name is Sornram

191
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:10,475
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
I have come to ask for mercy

192
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:19,530
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
Life has taught us many lessons

193
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:27,355
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
Mothers, please pity us

194
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:40,444
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
I pray that you succeed

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,777
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
To be millionaires

196
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:54,420
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
I pray that you have a shelter

197
00:14:54,977 --> 00:15:00,422
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
Made out of millions

198
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:07,510
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
I pray that you receive wealth

199
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:17,333
*Thai Musical Folk Song*
That keeps you away from all sufferings.

200
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:33,511
P

201
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:35,311
Yes Kwang.

202
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,266
I need to talk to you.

203
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,511
Right now the series is very different from the novel.

204
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,740
If you have any concerns.

205
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,420
You can talk to me

206
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,844
I feel that...

207
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,550
my novel is about...

208
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,444
the swimming club as the main.

209
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,750
It doesn't mention much about the Thai Folk dance.

210
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,911
Kwang.

211
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,133
It is still about the swimming club.

212
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,311
But the Folk dance is interesting.

213
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,350
That's why I added the script about it.

214
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,400
So people can watch and share more.

215
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,888
But if the added script is too different from the novel
I'm not okay with it.

216
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,444
Kwang, please calm down.

217
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,950
Right now
The competition is very high in the series Y market.

218
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,977
If I don't do something different.

219
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,200
How can I compete with other firms that have produced over ten series.

220
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,244
Okay

221
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,466
I've already given you the license anyway.

222
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,622
It's up to you now.

223
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,688
But I want to remind you.

224
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,444
The day you called to ask me for my novel license
What all did you say.

225
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,000
And have you kept your word or not.

226
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,844
All the media people,
Are you ready?

227
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,044
Yes. We are ready.

228
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,111
Congratulations
Today everyone's performance was great.

229
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,755
You liked it right.

230
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,550
My friend here is very talented.

231
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,244
We liked it very much.

232
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,177
We have K. Sornram as our special guest today
Do you want to say anything to our actors.

233
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,600
Anything for our actors.

234
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,711
Umm
Do you want me to advise about acting.

235
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,222
Or about love.

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,110
It's up to you.

237
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,533
I'm joking.

238
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,044
Today after getting to work with all of them,

239
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,644
I'm very impressed.

240
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,177
Because everyone is very hard working.

241
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:43,066
Escpecially Achi.

242
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,311
He can dance beautifully even before I taught him.

243
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,311
His dance was very pretty.

244
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,088
- Did you like...
- What are you all doing?

245
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,511
Excuse me.

246
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,710
Hello Bank.

247
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,600
P

248
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,711
Tai.

249
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,444
Hello.

250
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,422
Umm.

251
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,110
I saw that you are having an interview here.

252
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,000
Is it possible
If we want to interview too?

253
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,510
Are we being nosy?

254
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,910
Not at all You can join them.

255
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,550
Thank you very much.

256
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,066
Just now
Achi's dance was really pretty.

257
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,177
Don't you think so?

258
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,933
Or...

259
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,422
Achi is just very in with the main lead role.

260
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,800
Yes Even I noticed that just now.

261
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,577
Achi was very in character just now.

262
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,533
That made me wonder...

263
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,910
If Achi...

264
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,222
Is...

265
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:44,822
Or not.

266
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,288
Is what?

267
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,790
Is gay?

268
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,800
If I'm gay, so what?

269
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,910
Well...

270
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,230
First of all.

271
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,177
We need to stop stereotyping first.

272
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,866
We have to change our mindset.

273
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,533
Boys who can dance well...

274
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,466
or are into art...

275
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,711
don't necessarily have to always be gay.

276
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,155
But even if they are...

277
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,430
Well...

278
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,511
So what?
There is nothing wrong with that.

279
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,222
Because Achi' role here
is trying to represent a message...

280
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,466
to the society that, love...

281
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,000
doesn't always have to
happen between a boy and a girl.

282
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,533
And other than in the series
I hope that, one day, the society

283
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,150
will accept these relationships.

284
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,888
And allow them to live together, legally.

285
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,088
With equal rights as any other kind of relationship.

286
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,333
I want to voice out as well.

287
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,777
Just like Sornram.

288
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,266
Yes, I agree as well.

289
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,955
Because even I feel that
The clothes we wear.

290
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,266
Or the way we express ourself

291
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,822
shouldn't be used to define us or our gender.

292
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,422
This is good.

293
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,933
If we all get equal rights.

294
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,555
You might all get to see...

295
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,200
our wedding card soon.

296
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,470
Wedding card?

297
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,510
Really?

298
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,844
Alright everyone.

299
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,888
Shall we take a picture together?

300
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,333
Sure.

301
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,310
Net and James.

302
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,355
Do you want to join us for the picture?

303
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,377
Umm.

304
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,555
If you all don't mind.

305
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,977
Then yes.

306
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,844
Let's take a group photo with everyone.

307
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,710
- Sure.
- Yes.

308
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,422
Look at the camera please.

309
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:53,670
(Net James showed up to support their fellow actors
on the sets of Sing Swim the Series)

310
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,700
(The set was lively as Net James showed up to give support to the actors
If the series isn't a hit now, then we don't know what to say)
(Natty: My fave stole their thunder.
But was it his fault? He always shines.)

311
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,555
(Sick of Yaoi: What do you mean “stole their thunder”?)
(Hime: Gus and Bew said it first.
We need a marriage equality law.
I want to see them get married!)

312
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,533
- Thank you, Tai.
- Sure. No problem.

313
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,444
Excuse me first.

314
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,430
Just now, I sent a clip to the channel.

315
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,710
They are calling me in to talk

316
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,288
I don't know whats going on.

317
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:08,311
I have to go first See you later.

318
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,311
See you soon.

319
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,244
Well.

320
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,955
This couple never goes gentle on us.

321
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,088
How can we?

322
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,430
Most is always fiesty.

323
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,822
Oh, you are playing a trend today?
And its trending too.

324
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,390
Really? Thank you
Thank you very much.

325
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,466
Thank you You guys are so cute.

326
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,390
What do you call this?

327
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,377
- This?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,622
(Thai Folk dance hand step, other meaning is to flirt)
It's called Jeeb.

329
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,711
Can I flirt with you?

330
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,333
Can he flirt? Can he?

331
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,755
Stop it.

332
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,888
- We are on camera.
- Too much love around here.

333
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,688
Enough.

334
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,977
I'm going home.

335
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,800
Go.

336
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,270
Wait, wait, wait.

337
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,022
How are you going.

338
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,600
Motorcycle.

339
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,777
Motorcycle again?

340
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,910
When will you stop riding it?

341
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,377
It's dangerous.

342
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:20,555
Yeah, agree.

343
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,377
Hey.

344
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,444
You should be worried about yourself now.

345
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,270
You didn't bring your car today right.

346
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,355
Really?

347
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,133
You didn't bring your car?

348
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,911
Yeah.

349
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,200
You can go back with me.

350
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,022
Hey Look at that.

351
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,755
Their ship never stops sailing.

352
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,133
I'm going.

353
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,666
- See you Fern. Bye.
- Go home safely.

354
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,088
Call me when you get home.

355
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,822
Most, Achi.

356
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,844
Why haven't you changed yet?

357
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,030
Come quickly
We will wait at the car.

358
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,555
Come fast.

359
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:29,030
(Boy TTV)

360
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,710
(#Ypoll)
(Is it necessary that viewers need to know
who is the first male lead or the second male lead?)

361
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,222
(1. Yes, it is)
(2. No, it is not necessary)

362
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,600
(Next Break)
This is New.

363
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,377
One of our directors.

364
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,800
Why isn't there scene 6/9 in this break.

365
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,030
I don't think its important to the story.

366
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,733
But it's the selling scene.

367
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,822
P

368
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,155
Do you want to direct it yourself.

369
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,300
(Has Fern started long time back)

370
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,380
(Has Fern started long time back)
(Live early in the monring)
(What time do you all wake up)
Hello everyone. Today we are starting early.

371
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,222
(Hi Achi)
(Mommy bear's sunshine)
(Captain Fern is very hard working)
Hello everyone. Today we are starting early.

372
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,150
(Our representative)
(Good Morning)
(Achi is so cute, I'm going to faint)
- Lets give our boys some support.
- Hello. Achi is here.

373
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,466
Say hi to your FC's.

374
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,910
Yes.

375
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,150
(Why so early?)
(Achi is very damaging)
(I have exam today, please wish me)
(He's complaning 5555)
- Most doesn't take care of me.
- Oh no.

376
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,000
(Most is in trouble now)
(Most face is still sleepy)
(Very naughty Achi)
Lets ask him. What do you have to say Most?

377
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,511
It's... It's okay.

378
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,200
How does it feel to be separated
from Achi for 30 minutes already?

379
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,133
I miss him.

380
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,377
Hey, you two. I saw that just now.

381
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,177
- Go away.
- Are you possessive of each other?

382
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:49,888
- Nothing like that.
- Really!!

383
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,511
P. Hello.

384
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,644
Hello.

385
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,377
See you later everyone.

386
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,022
Are you almost done?

387
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,577
Umm.

388
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,577
Almost done. Just a little left.

389
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,177
Get done now.

390
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,110
- Done already.
- If you're done, then leave.

391
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,177
Ouch.

392
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:13,822
Tookta.

393
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:15,111
Yes?

394
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,670
Oh, okay.

395
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,466
Everyone.

396
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,111
I will take you to meet the new director
That the channel has sent.

397
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,977
What about Mike?

398
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,222
Well.

399
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,533
The channel asked us to change the director.

400
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,310
But don't worry.

401
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,022
You can pretend that you like him.

402
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:54,711
He's the director of 'The Sense'
Have you ever watched it?

403
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,200
Never mind.

404
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,230
Just keep smiling.

405
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,177
Tookta.

406
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,355
Yes?

407
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,955
Take everyone there.

408
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:06,190
Sure.

409
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,711
And make them stand in their positions.

410
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,911
Yes.

411
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,911
Sigh!

412
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,866
Hey.

413
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,266
Keep smiling.

414
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,466
Yeah.

415
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,111
Oh right. You guys can go first.

416
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,555
I'm having stomach ache

417
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,155
- I need to go to the toilet first.
- Okay.

418
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,390
Come there quickly.

419
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,200
Put this chair over there first
The team will take care of it.

420
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,111
New.

421
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,022
- Hello.
- Hello.

422
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,377
Everyone.

423
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,555
This is New.

424
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,155
Our director.

425
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,377
Because.

426
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,555
TTV wants to maintain the quality of the series.

427
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,511
To matct the standard overseas.

428
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,222
But don't be sad

429
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,333
Mike will keep coming back.

430
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,511
New.

431
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,511
These are our main actors.

432
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,111
- Please take care of us.
- Please do.

433
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:33,955
Series Y these days.

434
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:35,400
Hasn't changed at all.

435
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,822
There are only boys.

436
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:38,710
No girls at all

437
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,155
I'm here.

438
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,844
All our actors are new. So please.

439
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,111
Take care of them.

440
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,422
Sure.

441
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:47,600
Nice to meet you all.

442
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,955
I want to see you all working hard.

443
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,470
Even though...

444
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,200
This is just a Y series.

445
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,670
Tookta, right?
Yes.

446
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,990
Lets get to work.

447
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,711
Come on everyone.
Get to work. Wait, where is Earth?

448
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:14,822
Earth missed all the fun.

449
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,000
- Earth's gone.
- Let's go work.

450
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,666
Ouch, it hurts.

451
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,200
What.

452
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,355
Listen to me.

453
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,711
The director of The Sense,
is directing our series, really?

454
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:33,488
Yeah.

455
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,133
Does it hurt.

456
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,790
Let's go.

457
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,244
Why isn't scene 6/9 in this break?

458
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,177
Umm.

459
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,155
Today we have a lot of scenes.

460
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,844
So New asked to cut it out.

461
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,630
The kissing scene?

462
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,711
Yes.

463
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,777
Well

464
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,630
I don't see it important to the story.

465
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,022
So I thought...

466
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,066
we can fast forward to the scene
Note and Pao meet at the university in scene 6/10.

467
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,888
But that is the selliing scene.

468
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,133
You mean selling service.

469
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,711
I've hear them say.

470
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,155
Series y producers these days, don't focus on the plot.

471
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:24,990
Is it true?

472
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,830
The focus is on kiss scenes.

473
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,688
Or guys taking off their clothes ar enough.

474
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,550
How can you say this?

475
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,230
You used to direct Y series.

476
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,400
That's true.

477
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:42,244
But it was a long time ago.

478
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:44,800
After I joined the channel

479
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:47,111
I've developed my projects.

480
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:49,844
I don't focus on selling fan service anymore.

481
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,070
But then.

482
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,511
If you want, I can make it happen.

483
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:00,311
Tookta. Yes.

484
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,510
Come on, let's get ready for that scene.

485
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,670
Okay.

486
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:05,711
- Wait.
- Yes?

487
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,066
P

488
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,466
Do you want to direct it yourself.

489
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,830
You just do your job.

490
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:19,977
Yes.

491
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:26,044
Come one everyone. Go on to the sets

492
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:31,866
I've heard gossips that the channel wasn't impressed with Mike
so they had to change the director. I think its true.

493
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,133
Ofcourse they must do. It's their first Y series.

494
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,150
They want an experienced director
so they can sell this project overseas.

495
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,488
Oh my, what happens now?

496
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,977
Wait and see.

497
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,000
Everyone.

498
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,088
Have you read the script for scene 6/9?

499
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,355
Do you remember it?

500
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:54,022
Okay, for this scene, act as per stage direction.

501
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,577
Does it mean when and where
we move to on the camera, right?

502
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,066
- Tookta.
- Yes.

503
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,911
Before sending them for acting class.

504
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,488
I think they need language class.

505
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:10,266
Don't you know, that Y series have fanmeets abroad as well.

506
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,111
Yes.

507
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,177
To where?

508
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,088
It's okay.

509
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,111
Come on. Let's start.

510
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,155
Tookta.

511
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,070
Action.

512
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,200
No need to trouble you.

513
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,822
I can remove it myself.

514
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,133
Hey.

515
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,866
I didn't mean that way.

516
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,377
But you told me just now.

517
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,688
That you want me in exchange for money.

518
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,688
New, should we cut.

519
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,311
P

520
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,377
Should we cut now.

521
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:08,200
- I'm so happy, the actors are so cute.
- Energy on sets is great.

522
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,644
- My make up was very pretty.
- Don't you think so. It was great.

523
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,533
- No need to praise me too much, I'm shy.
- They're cute, don't you think?

524
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,600
Most, haven't you gone back yet?

525
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,044
I'm waiting for Achi

526
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,710
*Exclaiming excitedly*

527
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,000
I saw him changing, he should come soon.

528
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,670
Okay.

529
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,533
See you tomorrow.

530
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,822
- Yes, see you.
- Bye.

531
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,244
- Drive safely, bye bye.
- Thank you.

532
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,066
Hey, haven't you left?

533
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm about to.

534
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,666
Good.

535
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,790
Today was a lot of scenes, you must be tired.

536
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:18,088
And. How are you going back?

537
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:19,488
Did you bring your car?

538
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:23,711
I was feeling sleepy this morning.

539
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:25,955
So I didn't bring the car.

540
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:28,430
Then.

541
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,350
Do you want to go back on the motorbike with me?

542
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,750
I will drop you.

543
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,200
Sure.

544
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,555
I can go with you.

545
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,044
Hey.

546
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:48,977
Crazy. I'm joking.

547
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,977
When you go out.

548
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,711
You will see Most waiting for you.

549
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,066
Its already so late, he must have left.

550
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,088
No he won't leave.

551
00:34:57,622 --> 00:34:59,710
Especially if he knows that you didn't bring your car.

552
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:01,911
I guarantee.

553
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,688
He's waiting for you.

554
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,750
Sometimes.

555
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:11,911
I can't make out, which in content and which is real.

556
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:13,688
You guys are smooth.

557
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:23,577
But I think...

558
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,430
You can make out.

559
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,911
How I really am.

560
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,870
Do you want to try?

561
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,355
Achi, crazy.

562
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,666
Go home.

563
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:50,390
I'm going to change my clothes.

564
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:13,555
(Do BL shows need
sex scenes to be popular? Yes or no?)

565
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,311
(Next Break)
When you said.

566
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,511
That you can make out how I really am.

567
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,133
It might be true.

568
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,844
Because...

569
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,190
We are both the same.

570
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:47,377
Here.

571
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,230
Thanks.

572
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,155
Achi. Let's go change.

573
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,266
Okay.

574
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,377
Can you zip it for me?

575
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:26,333
Costume, if Achi is ready please bring him on to the set.

576
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,955
- Achi, Let's go.
- Yes?

577
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,830
What are you smiling at?

578
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,311
Achi, Most. Do you want some water?

579
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,088
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

580
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,070
Straw?

581
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,088
What about Fern's?

582
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,155
Hey, I forgot.

583
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:06,910
- I will get it for you.
- Never mind Most.

584
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:11,000
Being a girl on Y series set
I must take care of myself.

585
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:14,400
Its already so good that I'm getting to sit in AC room.

586
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:19,911
I'm, I'm sorry.

587
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:20,911
Here.

588
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,066
You can have mine.

589
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,755
Give it. I will open for you.

590
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:11,911
You can have with me.

591
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,777
Hey, someone will see us.

592
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:23,488
Let them see.

593
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:24,977
So they will know.

594
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:26,777
That you are my wife.

595
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,266
But we've already signed the contract.

596
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:31,977
We can be fined.

597
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,070
Fine then, I don't care.

598
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,190
Even I want to know that
If I am willing to pay the fine...

599
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
Will we be able to love each other?

600
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,466
New. Is this a pass?

601
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:22,533
Okay, cut
Change the scene please.

602
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:33,911
Why, why is everyone still?

603
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:35,933
Not change the scene. Next scene.

604
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,400
Go, go, go. Quickly.

605
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,422
What the hells with him.

606
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:46,622
If he doesn't want to direct
Then why not just stay home.

607
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:49,510
Why did he take up this job.

608
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,066
Hey. I'm sorry.

609
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:00,200
I forgot that you like him.

610
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,377
Never mind.

611
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:04,866
I like his work.

612
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:08,066
But if he's like this...

613
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,377
- Then I'm not okay too.
- I know.

614
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,111
Hey, are you talking about New?

615
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,977
Yeah!

616
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:24,577
Come on.

617
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:27,644
Aren't we all just like him.

618
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,800
Sometimes we have to force ourselves to do things
In order to reach our goals.

619
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,777
Nobody is lucky to get to do
Only what they want to do all the time.

620
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:45,644
- Right?
- You're right.

621
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:50,444
Don't be stressed.

622
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:52,688
But this is really annoying.

623
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,510
Fern.

624
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,200
Somebody crashed your motorbike.

625
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,430
Come quick.

626
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,288
Infront here.

627
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,333
Sorry, did you wait for long?

628
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:18,755
No.

629
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:20,800
No need to rush.

630
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,430
Do you want to go anywhere else?

631
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,333
No more
Lets go back to the condo.

632
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:32,066
It's good you got your car today.

633
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:34,755
Honestly.

634
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,911
Anyone couldve been the one
To crash my bike.

635
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:40,200
Why did it have to be New.

636
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:42,222
Lately he's been the issue for so many things.

637
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:45,644
But you are really calm.

638
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:47,622
Look at Most.

639
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,400
How hot tempered he was.

640
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:55,066
Actually I was very angry too
At the beginning.

641
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:56,777
Disappointed as well.

642
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,710
But then.

643
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:04,466
I started thinking and realized
What you said was right.

644
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,266
We all have a phase of...

645
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,844
Forcing ourselves to do something we don't want to.

646
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:12,777
Yup.

647
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,333
Do you have that phase too?

648
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:20,600
Well.

649
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,777
Ofcourse I do.

650
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,600
How can one be okay with everything?

651
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:33,800
Life is really hard.

652
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:39,866
Yeah, life is hard.

653
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,111
When we have to be someone
We are expected to be.

654
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,133
Rather than being someone
Who we want to.

655
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:47,950
Do you agree?

656
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,711
Yeah.

657
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,555
Actually.

658
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:07,422
This is not me at all.

659
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,822
When you said.

660
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,044
That I know how you really are.

661
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,555
It might be true.

662
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,310
Because.

663
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,222
We are both the same

664
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,030
(#Ypoll)
(Can you take it if your main
isn't the same as how you know them to be?)

665
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,950
(#Ypoll)
(1. Yes, can accept anything)
(2. Need to know what is it about)

666
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,870
(Next Break)
So the coffee shop at Fern's condo
that you were talking about...

667
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:41,910
Is this one?

668
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,888
I stopped to buy some coffee.

669
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:47,177
But it was close to Ferns condo
So I invited her out.

670
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:50,622
Don't think too much
If you already have feelings.

671
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,230
Anyone can develope feelings anytime.

672
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:54,822
You just have to admit
that you really like them.

673
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:57,044
I want to kiss you.

674
00:46:57,888 --> 00:46:58,822
Can I kiss you

675
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,111
I've never kissed a boy before.

676
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,750
If this is not for acting.

677
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,111
Do you know
When I was underwater...

678
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,600
what did I see?
