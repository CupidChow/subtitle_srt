Go.

Did you forget, we have a mover.

22
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,580
This much is enough.

23
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,999
Okay okay.

24
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:56,911

And this is.

28
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,125
Fun Gossip show.

Priang Prang.

31
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,167
Your beautiful MC and our special guest today.

32
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,999
They are, Gus and Bew.

33
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,876
Hello. Can we have an applause?

34
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,792
Oye.

35
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,999
So cute.

36
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,083
This is called, a house model.

37
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:53,999
Yes.

38
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,876
- For both of you?
- That's right.

39
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,888
It's like a dream. A dream come true?

40
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,990
Like, you have a house, live as a couple.

41
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,999
Living together openly in public.

42
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:04,511
Yes.

43
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,133
That's right.

44
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:07,377
But honestly

45
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,244
I think

46
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,374
I wasn't able to keep it secret since the beginning

47
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:11,177
I think.

48
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,080
FC's already knew about it.

49
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,542
They all know.

50
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,584
The whole country knows.

51
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,584
Me. I was like oh ho!

52
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,266
Asked since the last time

53
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,288
if you were real couple
and not just a shipped couple.

54
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:24,450
But you kept pretending you were ship.

55
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:25,809
And the first time.

56
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,918
How did you meet? Tell us.

57
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,670
Well, when I first met Bew right?

58
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,600
It was 4-5 years ago.

59
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,022
When Bew got into the university and.

60
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,370
He had to come to BKK.

61
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,375
I went to pick him up.

62
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,220
Pla and Toon were not free at that time.

63
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,950
And when I first saw him.

64
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:43,711
You fell in love?

65
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,209
At first it was the environment.

66
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,834
Like, we didn't know how to act.

67
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,999
But Gus started talking.

68
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,088
We got a bit more relaxed

69
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,990
I was impressed with that a little.

70
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,290
Just a little?

71
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:55,950
Well.

72
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:57,480
Bew?

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,755
Is cute.

74
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,200
Smart.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,330
I knew from then that his future is going to be great.

76
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,620
But what I didn't know.

77
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,930
That, our future would be together.

78
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,370
Oye.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,133
Let's do this.

80
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,555
Can we say like this.

81
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:17,000
That you being together.

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,200
Loving each other, knowing each other.

83
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,933
Was because of Pla and Cartoon.

84
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:24,111
Well.

85
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,620
You can say that.

86
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,466
Because really.

87
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,133
If we didn't have them.

88
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,288
We wouldnít be here today.

89
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,470
And have you had a chance to talk to them?

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,790
How do you want me to believe P' Gong.

91
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,422
That it was a coincidence.

92
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:51,540
What if it was not.

93
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,580
What will you two do?

94
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:00,410
Is my dress pretty?

95
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,050
Don't have to say anything much

96
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,666
I know what you both want.

97
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:07,830
About that news.

98
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,511
Let me come back from the tour

99
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:11,880
I will let Gus and Bew go on to the show.

100
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,400
And let them talk nice things about you.

101
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:26,480
You Don't have to do that

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,350
2 million.

103
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:41,410
That's then.

104
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,290
Thank you.

105
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:44,876
Sis.

106
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:45,999
Get up.

107
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:46,584
Sis.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Quick.

109
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,044
Oh.

110
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,990
Your dress is pretty.

111
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:17,488
Well.

112
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,950
Havent spoken to them.
They are busy with their new starts too.

113
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,977
Oh.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,511
Ah, never mind.

115
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,750
Hope you have a chance to talk.

116
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,133
Right. Ah.

117
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,000
Let me ask you.
After opening up to the public.

118
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,083
People say that Gus is 100% man.

119
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:38,790
But like a man who loves you only.

120
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,133
I think.

121
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:44,066
This generation we Don't have to specify the gender.

122
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:44,780
Well.

123
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,540
But if you ask me.

124
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,688
I am ready to admit

125
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:49,866
I like men.

126
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,250
But Don't worry. If you think.

127
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,032
That if you are gay,
it means you have to like all men.

128
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:57,266
It's not like that.

129
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,792
Because I won't let that happen.

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,466
So harsh.

131
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:05,600
A man who only loves you.

132
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,070
WellÖ

133
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,459
I want to say wellÖ..

134
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,709
Super long well.

135
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,459
Longer than the outer space.

136
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,044
On this earth.

137
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,790
You love each other so much.

138
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,167
Do you want to get married.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,133
Well.

140
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,620
If this country allows equal marriage.

141
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,990
We would be sending our wedding card to everyone.

142
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,711
Anyway.

143
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,080
We.

144
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,266
Would like to voice out.

145
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,830
As a citizen.

146
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,000
Please help promote this.

147
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,311
Let's say.

148
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,990
We request it from our hearts.

149
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:43,644
Umm.

150
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:46,222
This is really impressive. I hope.

151
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,790
One day in future.

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,644
We will get to see equal marriage.

153
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:52,511
Yes.

154
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,540
Back to work.

155
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,222
Well.

156
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,540
Oh ho! I can say that this is sizzling.

157
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:58,999
In the trend, right now.

158
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,626
- Your series in going to air next month.
- Yes.

159
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:03,830
Are you expecting that you will get.

160
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,400
An award from Y Galaxy.

161
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,177
This.

162
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,155
I think.

163
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,866
Depends on the teams if they will choose

164
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,990
imagine, just imagining

165
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,222
imagine if

166
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:20,133
Gus gets and Bew doesn't, how would you feel.

167
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,330
Will you be annoyed.

168
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,133
Not at all.

169
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,022
Honestly

170
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,542
I am happy for Gus on every achievement.

171
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,444
Right?

172
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,540
In the end, no matter who gets,
the award is in the same house.

173
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,732

You've been through so much together.

182
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,080
You really want to end it like this?

183
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,222
I always miss her.

184
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,000
But what to do.

185
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,480
This matter is big and gone too far.

186
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,870

What's the hurry.

194
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,600
You left me at the studio.

195
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,400

00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:37,777
I thought.

213
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,822
You were going to propose.

214
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,288
Crazy.

215
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,622
Not only for birthday.

216
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,910
Do you know.

217
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,088
That you got nominated for Y Galaxy?

218

My birthday this year is the happiest.

225
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,240
To get nominated?

226
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,533
Crazy.

227
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,200
To stay with you.

228
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,825
Where.

229
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:28,364

Mom.

Should I put this here.

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,644
Will it look like.

234
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,733
Too much? I Don't know.

235
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:08,666
Up to you mom.

236
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,733
You are the one to get me this room.

237
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,044
But this is your room.

238
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,111
Or am I messing too much?

239
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Am I messing too much?
Is it okay with you?

240
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,488
Oye.

241

I mean.

243
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,244
You have every right in this room, like me.

244
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,688

For letting me be another mom for you.

248
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:59,022
Speaking of this.

249
00:16:00,622 --> 00:16:01,577
When you graduate.

250
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
And you get famous.

251
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Have lots of work.

252
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,577
Do you want me to make a contract?

253
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:10,555
Oye.

254
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,222
We spoke about this.

255
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,666
I Don't want a paper binding us.

256
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:18,533
But I Don't want problems in the future.

257
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,288
What are you doing?

258
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:34,777
Oh.

259
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,044
You want to make, Let's make one now.

260
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:39,711

261
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,000
Mr. Banawith.

As mother son.

267
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:57,288
Without ending.

268
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,533
Let it go already.

269
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,600
Priang already said, he doesn't care.

270
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:22,377
Why do you want me to let go.

271
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,466
It's not going to be fun.

272
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,881
(I'm still sad: didn't get to sing Happy Birthday
for each other again)

273
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,945
(Realize when It's too late

274
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,842
Don't think too much.

00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,222
(Next Break)

276
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:51,755

Let's talk some other day mom.

278
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,733
Don't call me mom, Bew.

279
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,088
If you Don't really mean it.

280
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,050

00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:30,533
- Speech.
- Umm.

348
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,177
Hello hello.

349
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:41,968
Remember. The Greatest Y award.

350
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:44,288
Is your biggest dream.

351
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,260
If you want it.

352
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,577
You have to fight.

353
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:49,511
Will you fight?

354
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:50,911
Okay? Okay.

355
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,022
Okay?

356
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:52,577
Bew.

357
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:53,622
Bew.

358
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:54,176
Bew.

359
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:54,600
Bew.

360
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:56,222
You okay?

361
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,733
Yeah. Like this. Okay.

362
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,550
P first, Bew second.

363
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:06,510
Please take care, take care of everyone.

364
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,090
See you on the stage.

365
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:11,670
You miss her?

366
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,300
Deeply you want her to come cheer?

367
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,170
It feels weird.

368
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:35,260
We came here last year.

369
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:37,422
Nobody knew us.

370
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,590
No one even cared.

371
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,590
Only our moms.

372
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,420
Keep encouraging us.

373
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,044
Honestly.

374
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,650
The person who needs to be beside us.

375
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,200
Isnt here to see us successful.

376
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,920
Don't think too much.

377
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,400
If you see them.

378
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:08,488
We can talk.

379
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:09,666
Okay.

380
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,111
If not.

381
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:12,777
If you don't meet.

382
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:14,933
You still have me.

383
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:20,666
Umm.

384
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,111
Can we talk some other time mom.

385
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,600
Today I can't.

386
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,130
Don't call me mom.

387
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,711
If you don't mean it.

388
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:41,644
How could you do this.

389
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:44,888
What?

390
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:45,822
What are you saying.

391
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:48,688
Yo.

392
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,511
Why are you here.

393
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,022
Bew.

394
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,010
Breathe. Slowly.

395
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,488
Today you don't have to get shock.

396
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:02,630
Everyone already knows.

397
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,960
That what you do, Is acting.

398
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,427
Bew, Bew, Bew.

399
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,218
If Teacher Vi saw this.

400
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:10,800
- He must be really proud.
- Breathe slowly.

401
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,600
What acting.

402
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:16,666
What are you saying.

403
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,090
What acting?

404
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,110
Bew.

405
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,244
Logged in to his account on my I-pad.

406
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,260
When he searches anything,
I can see everything.

407
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:33,822
Let me ask you.

408
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,800
Why would you search about shock and ceizures.

409
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:40,843
If you didn't want it to use as an excuse.
When being cornered.

410
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,488
What problems do you have.

411
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,555
Why do you need to pretend to be shock.

412
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:00,733
So?

413
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,977
You were behind everything.

414
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,260
Like what they said?

415
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:09,511
Oh!

416
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:11,155
Why are you quiet.

417
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:12,444
Answer.

418
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,670
When Gus lied to you.

419
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:18,244
You got so mad.

420
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,244
And now.

421
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,311
Don't you plan to tell him the truth.

422
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:23,377
Huh.

423
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,630
I have evidence.

424
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:29,644
Tell the truth Bew.

425
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,133
Umm.

426
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:46,733
Hhh.

427
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:48,666
Huh.

428
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,710
The entertainment industry.

429
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:00,933
That night when.

430
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:04,010
When I knew you all lied to me.

431
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:06,920
I was so angry.

432
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,170
I thought of a revenge plan.

433
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,066
So I can get away from you all.

434
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:14,977
Go back now.

435
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:19,260
Before anger turns into hatred.

436
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,629
I had to make myself look pitiful.

437
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,016
(Edit Profile)
I had to make myself look pitiful.

438
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:46,842
(Edit Profile)

439
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,260
(Edit Profile)
Make myself the prey.

440
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:48,975
(Edit Profile)

441
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:50,733
Make myself more famous.

442
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:53,090
So I can go and be independent.

443
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,210
So I used Toon's account.

444
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,710
Messaged Detetctive Girl.

445
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,666
But who she was, I didn't know.

446
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,090
It was a coincidence.

447
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:09,022
But.

448
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:11,533
The clip we were rehearsing and the alcohol bottle fell down.

449
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:13,911
And the news about me being an alcoholic.

450
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,088
Happened before you knew about our plan.

451
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:18,355
Ow.

452
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,170
That means what you did.

453
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,466
Because you were angry at us.

454
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:24,176
No.

455
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:30,888
Toon, say it.

456
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:36,630
When I went into her account.

457
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:39,200
The clip of the alcohol bottle falling.

458
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:41,355
Was already sent to Detective Girl.

459
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:43,155
Ah.

460
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,466
Hows it Toon.

461
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:47,822
Yeah.

462
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,933
It was me.

463
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,066
I did it.

464
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:54,333
Damn it.

465
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:56,260
I wanted revenge.

466
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,622
That you exposed me.

467
00:26:57,755 --> 00:27:00,460
That I was involved in your plan.

468
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,170
What the heck is this.

469
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:12,622
Then?

470
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,355
Spread your own clip?

471
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,111
You were confident you won't drop?

472
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:18,155
Huh.

473
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:23,170
No risk, no fame

474
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:36,688
(2 Top competitors Bew Banawich and P Atichon P's FC voting to get him the award 2 years in a row Will Bew's FC agree?)

475
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,088
(Next Break)
Toon was suspicious at you since the clip went viral.

476
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:42,666
But she didn't do anything cause she loved you.

477
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:44,844
I am sorry.

478
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:47,133
I didn't think through.

479
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,840
I thought that by doing this.

480
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,955
Pla would blame Toon.

481
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:53,244
And fight event more.

482
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:55,444
So?

483
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,040
Toon wasn't involved in this?

484
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What the heck is this.

485
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,600
And what.

486
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:20,622
You released your own clip.

487
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,200
You were confident that it won't drop.

488
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,200
Huh.

489
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,200
No risk, no fame!

490
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,125
I believed.

491
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,600
No matter what, people will pity me.

492
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:38,393
(I thought you were naive,
can't trust this anymore)

493
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:38,958
But that time.

494
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:39,892
(Thank you the person
who released the clip, It's so good)

495
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,244
There were mixed positive and negative views.

496
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,400
They were so close.

497
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:43,279
(P's Facebook)

498
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,911
So I had to find a way to fix it.

499
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,375
I believed that.

500
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,755
If P saw me sad.

501
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:50,688
And came in to give me encouragement.

502
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,711
(I saw your post. Wait! Coming to see you)
His FC would support too.

503
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,355
I will tag you.

504
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:55,666
Both of you.

505
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,667
Thank you.

506
00:28:58,667 --> 00:28:59,833
That really happened.

507
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,333
You are good.

508
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,311
So.

509
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,311
You did this to get FC's sympathy.

510
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,888
And.

511
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,266
To make Toon and Pla fight more.

512
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,166
In the end.

513
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,911
If it can go back to Toon.

514
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,977
I will have an excuse to leave.

515
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,083
And when you were.

516
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,888
Angry at me.

517
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:22,542
Punching me.

518
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,533
Was it all acting.

519
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:25,111
Sorry.

520
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,375
Does anyone have popcorn.

521
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,844
This is so fun.

522
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:28,950
You are another one, Yo.

523
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,866
How are you involved with me going to jail.

524
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,955
Bew, please continue.

525
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:43,620
Yo.

526
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,533
I understand you.

527
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,488
Coming this far.

528
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,044
What you all you to go through.

529
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,488
And had to be bashed because of others.

530
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:55,711
You could be demotivated.

531
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,958
And the people
who didn't have to try anything.

532
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,688
But get everything easily.

533
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,688
The more I think, the more revengeful I am, damn.

534
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,250
Think about it.

535
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:11,488
I think of a project so hard.

536
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,755
Coordinate.

537
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,355
Take control of everyone but I only get 30K monthly.

538
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:20,390
And another person,
just taking pictures with serum on social.

539
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,355
Gets the same amount.

540
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,311
Damn it.

541
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:27,288
I have to pay for my car.

542
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,709
I have to pay for electricity.

543
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,697
I have to take care of my child.

544
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,790
Hey.

545
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:38,133
You have a child?

546
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:40,666
3 months old.

547
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,800
Honestly, I didn't want to have.

548
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,622
But they were already born.

549
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,000
So I have to take good care of them.

550
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Yo.

551
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,622
I really want to help you.

552
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:02,977
But.

553
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,111
Can you help me first.

554
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,583
Why did you do this?

555
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:14,866
Gus

556
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,444
im sorry.

557
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,622
I didn't think well.

558
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,422
I thought that if I did this.

559
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,466
Pla would be suspicious of Toon.

560
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,800
And fight even more.

561
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:26,666
So.

562
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,466
Toon wasn't involved in this?

563
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,422
Gus.

564
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,377
Remember the night I called you.

565
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,777
I thought you were the one to spread the clip.

566
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:39,266
So I wanted to go see you at home.

567
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,288
But I saw you leaving to see Yo.

568
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,555
I followed you there.

569
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:45,266
Ah.

570
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,755
And saw me.

571
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,750
When I was leaving.

572
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:50,550
(N' Sugus)

573
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,583
How did the police come?

574
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,488
It wasn't in the plan?

575
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Oh yeah.

576
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,355
The news of Gus being drunk and getting dragged out.

577
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,688
Is not going to be as hit as getting arrested by police.

578
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,375
I don't know.

579
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,155
There are drugs inside.

580
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:06,955
If Gus goes to jail.

581
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,490
I have nothing to do with it.

582
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,244
There are drugs?

583
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,577
Yo.

584
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,688
Yo.

585
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:13,622
Yo.

586
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,955
You called the police?

587
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:25,822
Gus, I am sorry.

588
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,355
Who would've thought
there would be drugs.

589
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,606
I just wanted a picture of you
being dragged out of the house.

590
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,355
Bew

591
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,711
I went to jail

592
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,222
I went to court.

593
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,688
If I didn't win the case,
what will happen.

594
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:41,911
Did you think?

595
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,666
Well.

596
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,533
When I knew you went to jail because of me.

597
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,711
I felt so bad, really.

598
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,406
I quickly went to find evidence to help you out of jail.

599
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,977
I feel really bad

600
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,711
Gus.

601
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,000
I feel really bad.

602
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,809
Feel bad? Feel bad?
Then why did you do it?

603
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,291
Then why did you do it?

604
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:03,760
(K Tai TTV)

605
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,790
Yes K. Kong.

606
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,622
That's why I am interested in Gus and Bew.

607
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,400
To diversify them into new things such as.

608
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,466
Theatres.

609
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,711
It's interesting K. Thai.

610
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,166
But in this era.

611
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,444
There are so many Y couples.

612
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,777
Why did you choose Gus Bew.

613
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,155
Well.

614
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,422
Because they are an example of new generation Thai artist.

615
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,560
That has been through so many problems.

616
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,790
- But is able to come back...
- K. Thai

617
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,422
I am a grown up.

618
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,822
Tell me honestly.

619
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:39,377
K. Kong.

620
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,222
They are the most popular now.

621
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,583
The more drama, the more money.

622
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,688
And if they get the Greatest Y award tonight.

623
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,044
We can go and talk to the movie theatres.

624
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,533
Toon was suspicious of you since the clip went viral.

625
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,244
But she didn't do anything because she loved you.

626
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,822
I gave you many chances Bew.

627
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,600
If you didn't want to speak in front of Gus.

628
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,288
You could come talk to me.

629
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:06,866
Yeah.

630
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
Atleast say sorry.

631
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,355
But whats this.

632
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
Just standing there, and not saying anything.

633
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,888
It's because you want this award, right?

634
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,125
But isnt it fair.

635
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,244
Even you did unfair to me.

636
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,088
I am just taking back.

637
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:33,511
So we are even.

638
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:36,667
Um.

639
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:38,088
Great.

640
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:41,044
You don't regret anything, do you.

641
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,022
Who told me.

642
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,155
That this industry.

643
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,488
The more fake.

644
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,311
The more fiesty.

645
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,311
The more people like.

646
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,177
Here.

647
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,622
I made it fiesty.

648
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:02,041
But it doesn't mean that
you can betray us all like this.

649
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:03,625
Understand.

650
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,511
And what you did.

651
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,833
When you did.

652
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,933
You said you loved me.

653
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,017
Here, I am doing because I love myself.

654
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,444
Love Gus, can't I?

655
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,866
And what.

656
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,933
That day, didnt Kong already pay you money to be quiet.

657
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,733
I didn't take it.

658
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,577
And no one can close my mouth.

659
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,755
Okay!

660
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,177
What do you want.

661
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,490
You going to walk out and expose me infront of everyone.

662
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,355
In front of all my FC's.

663
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:45,022
Sorry but.

664
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:47,000
Who will believe you.

665
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:49,240
You don't have any evidence.

666
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,400
Pla and Toon are pressuring me to tell the truth
Who is behind everything.

667
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,644
Or they will sue me.

668
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,208
Did you tell them it was me?

669
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,177
How much do you want.

670
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,333
Damn it Yo, you betrayed me?

671
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,355
I paid you so much

672
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:09,600
can't help it.

673
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,911
Toon was giving me more.

674
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:22,750
Hey

675
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,417
Gus.

676
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:23,958
Stop!

677
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,666
Stop!

678
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,355
You are such a bastard.

679
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,466
You took money from Toon.

680
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,470
And you faked and took more money from Bew.

681
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:34,950
How are you different from me?

682
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,666
Even you fake for money.

683
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,400
Did you know! You made my life so miserable. Damn it.

684
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,523
You stole my job when we were young.

685
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,866
You created scenes during the concert,
got me scolded from my boss everyday.

686
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,133
Yo!

687
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:53,622
Do you know.

688
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,208
Why is your life like this?

689
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,155
Because you can only think this low.

690
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:00,874
Grow up.

691
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,208
Why revenging like a child

692
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,790
don't overreact.

693
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:06,500
Yes.

694
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,166
I admit.

695
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,625
You're in trouble.

696
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:11,488
And not rich.

697
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,417
I feel pity for you.

698
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,311
But this is not an excuse.

699
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:18,458
For you to hurt others like this.

700
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,244
You too, Bew.

701
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,711
You are hurt.

702
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,755
It's no reason.

703
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:35,622
To hurt everyone else.

704
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,533
That sound clip.

705
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,458
Doesnt say.

706
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,577
What all have I done.

707
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,088
Even if you expose, P' Kong will be able to help me.

708
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,200
So.

709
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:51,955
I'm going to prepare to receive the award.

710
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:05,500
The sound clip might not be clear.

711
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:06,733
But this.

712
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:08,644
Is it clear enough?

713
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,991
(didn't go to Y Galaxy but appeared in Incheon)

714
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:23,624
(Exclusive P tells us that he will stop acting
and go into behind the scenes)

715
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,809
(Being pressured Gus Bew admists Kong went to Korea
instead of coming to Y Galaxy. Might be going International!)

716
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,400
(Next Break)
I want to take this opportunity.

717
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,958
Say thank you to everyone.

718
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,290
That helped me reach here.

719
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,417
Did you make the right decision?

720
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,711
You were born to be an actor.

721
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,493
Why did you do this.

722
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,266
Gus

723
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:34,032
im sorry.

724
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,377
When I told you about.

725
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,288
Wanting to get out from Toon.

726
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,511
And go stay with you.

727
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,044
It was the truth.

728
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,911
I really love you.

729
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,755
I love you so much that
I forgot to think of everyones feelings.

730
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,044
Can you forgive me?

731
00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:51,451
Please.

732
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,866
Pla

733
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,044
im sorry.

734
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,600
I didn't think it would become such a big deal

735
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,800
im wrong.

736
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,466
I don't mean to.

737
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,755
Im sorry.

738
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:16,688
Mom.

739
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:19,666
Mom.

740
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,466
Mom.

741
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,222
Mom

742
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,288
im really sorry mom

743
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,733
I didn't mean to.

744
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:31,936
Can you forgive me?

745
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,111
You know I am not like that.

746
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,466
You stayed with me for so many years.

747
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,088
I didn't mean it, mom.

748
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:46,510
I don't know why I did that.

749
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:50,288
I didnt want to do like this at all.

750
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,949
Can you forgive me mom.

751
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,377
You can scold me anything, I won't mind.

752
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:57,288
Bew.

753
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:58,820
Bew.

754
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,111
Get up.

755
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:00,859
Bew, son.

756
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,800
Get up.

757
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:03,032
Get up.

758
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,324
Up.

759
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:06,333
Bew.

760
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,720
(This live video is hidden)

761
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:28,574
If you really feel sorry.

762
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,333
Not because you got caught.

763
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,044
Then leave from here.

764
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,955
Leave this industry.

765
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,955
And I will erase this clip.

766
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,955
But if you pretend like you don't care.

767
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
And go up to receive the award.

768
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:47,866
Like nothing has happened.

769
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,222
I will change it to public.

770
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,111
Everyone will see.

771
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,990
You choose.

772
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,777
But this is my dream.

773
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,111
I know.

774
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,733
Mom.

775
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,066
Can I go get the award first.

776
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,511
I waited for this moment my whole life.

777
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,444
Ummm.

778
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,311
Let me just go get the award.

779
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,050
And whatever you want me to do.

780
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:30,092
However you want me to take responsibility

781
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,444
I will do anything.

782
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,666
I will, really.

783
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,644
Mom, will you be mean to me.

784
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,244
And destroy my future.

785
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,600
Bew.

786
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,488
No ones destroying your future.

787
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,422
You are the one destroying it.

788
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,933
Gus.

789
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,400
Everything I said to you.

790
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,800
The night we were building the model.

791
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:12,777
It was true.

792
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:16,605
That I wanted to get out from Toon
And come stay with you.

793
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,777
I really want to stay with you.

794
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:22,889
So we can love each other like this.

795
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,266
In front and behind the camera.

796
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,577
I was wrong to get you in jail

797
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:35,911
im wrong that I didn't tell you the plan.

798
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,488
But you love me right?

799
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,933
You will forgive me right?

800
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,400
I didn't love this Bew.

801
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,088
The one who wanted the award.

802
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:52,626
And don't care about anyone.

803
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,032
Or anything.

804
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,755
Not even his own dignity.

(Screamm! That's my boy #Bew's guardian)
(My son has to get the award)

Bew.

816

Please come. Come.

817

Hello. Hello.

818
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,711

(He's so skinny. Is he on drugs like Gus?)
(My beautiful son on stage)

819
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,377
I want to take this opportunity

820
00:44:47,466 --> 00:44:48,420

Nott's FC, please give my son some light to shine)

821
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:49,907
To thank everyone.

822
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,377
To help me get to this point.

823
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:55,630
(Can we have a concert, I want to see Gus Bew)
(Are there going to be surprises today?)
(Want to watch Scent of Love SS2)

824
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,844
I want to thank.

Mommy Toon. s.

Calm down! He's going to thank last)

834
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,022
And.

835
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,880
(So emotional, im gonna cry
Lighting is not like an award show)

836

I really love you.

838

839
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:22,977
And sorry.

840
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,500
(They really love each other. They really do!)

841

(Is he okay? He doesnt look happy)

843
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,800
The one who wanted the award.

844
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,533
And don't care about anyone.

845

Or anything.

846
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,377
Not even his own dignity.

847
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,260
(Why is he saying sorry?)
(Why did he stop?)

848
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:42,404
If you want to be the best.

849
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,800
But no one to be happy with you.

850
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:46,420
(Why did he stop speaking?)
(So emotional)

851
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,533
Up to you.

852
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,553
(He said sorry.)
(What's it about?)
(What is going on?)

853
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,175
(don't be quiet. Im not feeling good)
(Oye, my heart. What happened?)

854
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,955
I want to take this opportunity.

855
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:06,716
(He almost said it)

856
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,911
To talk about the manager's war hashtag.

857
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,950
(That's it)
(Here we go)
(I can smell blood and drama)

858
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,883
(Managers war again.)
(It's been over months now)
(What now?)

859
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,422
I am sorry Toon.

860
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:16,250
(Calm down!)
(He's just talking about the new)
(I don't understand)

861
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,311
That I made everyone misunderstand you.

862
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,488
That I left.

863
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,622
And people thought.

864
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,533
I was the prey.

865
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,820
And Toon and Pla

866
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,022
(don't, please don't)
And Toon and Pla.

867
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:26,370
(What are you trying to say)
(Say it Bew. I can't take the suspense)

868
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,333
Were the bad guys.

869
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:30,241
But today.

870
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,088
I understood that.

871
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,844
No matter how the industry is.

872
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,000
Good or bad.

873
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,377
Having someone beside is very important.

874
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:42,633
(Bew, can you not say anything)
(I don't want to know anymore)

875
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,222
But I can't just leave.

876
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:45,133
(Not clear. Moms were fighting. Weren’t they the bad guys
Talking like a detective series finding the killer)

877
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:45,866
Toon.

878
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:46,440
(Theres a twist.)(I was getting emotional.)
(What a bummer)

879
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,088
Pla

880
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,488
Gus.

881
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,111
To feel worse about this.

882
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,760
(He's saying it)
(Hes confessing it)
(What is he looking at?)
(Anyone present there?
Can you tell what is he looking at?)

883
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,470
(It's like Mommy Toon left from there)
(What? Really?)
(Can someone translate)

884
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,444
Bew.

885
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:25,533
No need to say anymore.

886
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,555
No need to confess.

887
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,688
Because It's okay.

888
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,533

906

00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,906
For letting me come here today.

909
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,175
(She wants the light)
(Fake much?)
(Getting Kla Peak to cover the news)

910
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,511
I wanted to.

911
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,044
Really wanted to.

912
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:36,616
Come and congratulate.

913
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:38,282
My son.

914
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:41,116
And I wanted to say.

915
00:48:41,806 --> 00:48:42,765
I want to end.

916
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:43,300
(There is always someone who is not our relative
But loves us the most)

917
00:48:43,324 --> 00:48:45,116
All the rumours.

918
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,821
(Oh, okay. Clearing the rumours)
Scared that Kla and Peak won't sell)
(I think shes talking real. She loves him.)

919
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,644
Excuse me.

920
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:51,601
(She wants to clear everything)
(This is not scripted)

921
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:54,745
(Look at Bew's facce.)(He's broken)
(This is so real.)
(He really loves his mom)

922
00:48:57,297 --> 00:48:59,297
(Whats with the curtains? Who won the award)

923
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,820
(P saying his speech)

924
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,990
It's funny

925
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,222
I was so confident about the award.

926
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,177
Turns out P got it.

927
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,066
Is your decision confirmed?

928
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,555
I want to take a break.

929
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,590
But if I have any job, I will come back.

930
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,311
Or if not, if I enjoy selling papaya salad.

931
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:45,690
I might not come back.

932
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,783
Huh. No way.

933
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,911
You were born to be an actor.

934
00:49:57,066 --> 00:49:58,155
Let me ask you.

935
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,844
You really thought I would expose you?

936
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,577
Then why did you confess.

937
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:12,022
Hmm.

938
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,200
Because I knew that.

939
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,244
And I felt really bad.

940
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:20,911
Honestly.

941
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:24,282
No matter how fake the industry is.

942
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:28,860
But you loving me.

943
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:30,809
And taking really good care of me.

944
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,888
It's all true.

945
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,800
Cause I am your mom.

946
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,644
Here.

947
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,133
By the way.

948
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,155
I wanted to return but havent had the chance

949
00:50:51,324 --> 00:50:53,044
don't you want to keep this so you miss me.

950
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,600
Bew.

951
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,266
It's just a piece of paper.

952
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,711
I have all my memories kept.

953
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,244
Do you know where?

954
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:03,822
Where.

955
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,177
In here.

956
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,533
Give me a hug.

957
00:51:51,907 --> 00:51:54,100
(Bew trying to call Gus)

958
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,333
Bew.

959
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,333
Travel safe.

960
00:52:26,658 --> 00:52:27,658
Thank you.

961
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:32,986
Do you want a picture together?

962
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,000
Why not take a group picture.

963
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,800
Sorry.

964
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:57,022
Was able to gather just this much

965
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,511
1,2

966
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,333
Thank you for coming to see me.

967
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,288
Welcome.

968
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,600
And.

969
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:47,699
I am really sorry.

970
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,311
For disappointing you all.

971
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,666
Never mind.

972
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,177
Then.

973
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,022
Can I take a picture of you all for memory.

974
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:02,449
Yes.

975
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,822
Can I take too?

976
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:16,511
Take it. What are you waiting for.

977
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,866
Come

978
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,906
1,2

979
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:26,574
1,2

980
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:30,488
Done.

981
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,555
Thank you.

982
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,777
I didn't think you would come.

983
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:50,324
I had to.

984
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,266
The day you came from Ubon.

985
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,733
I came to pick you.

986
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,777
You are going back, I have to come see you off.

987
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,377
How did you know I was leaving today.

988
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:04,044
Toon told me.

989
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,266
Honestly, I am still angry.

990
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,133
But I love you more.

991
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,266
I think.

992
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:24,730
You already got your lesson.

993
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:33,949
I don't know.

994
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,377
Maybe I didn't learn anything at all.

995
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,177
I chose not to leave the industry.

996
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,511
But went to confess on stage.

997
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,200
I might just want to create a scene or gain sympathy.

998
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,111
In the end, I just want people to love me.

999
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,911
In the end, I am just selfish.

1000
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:02,969
Everyone who comes into this industry.

1001
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:05,150
Wants people to love them.

1002
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:06,699
Accept them.

1003
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:08,938
You just need to make sure that.

1004
00:56:09,044 --> 00:56:10,755
The things you do for yourself.

1005
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,133
Isnt hurting anyone, thats it.

1006
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,111
But I hurted you.

1007
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,533
I hurt everyone.

1008
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,666
You must hate me right.

1009
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,644
I did so mean to you.

1010
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,133
But who decides.

1011
00:56:37,755 --> 00:56:39,622
That being an actor means having everything.

1012
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,200
Actors are human too.

1013
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,866
And humans have two sides.

1014
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:47,711
It depends.

1015
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:49,333
If you get to see both sides.

1016
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,155
And how much you see.

1017
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:52,888
Thats it.

1018
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,044
If you see all sides.

1019
00:56:58,574 --> 00:56:59,774
Will you still choose to love.

1020
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,120
♪ Keep the love that has just gone ♪

1021
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:17,193
