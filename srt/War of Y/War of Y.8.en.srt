1
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:11,459
Bew.

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:12,834
Say something.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,755
I'm worried about you.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,933
You want me to come to you and cry.

5
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:22,070
Forgive you for everything.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,133
Go back to being the same.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,688
And act as if nothing happened?

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,709
It's not like that Bew.

9
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,500
I really didn't mean to.

10
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,250
You can scold me all you want.

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,042
You are not wrong.

12
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,626
I am.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,311
For not being smart and making a contract
with you like the law says.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,751
That contract from the heart we have.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,933
Is why you can do anything to me.

16
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,422
Hurt me.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,222
I didn't mean to hurt you.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,022
Go back.

19
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:22,800
Before the anger turns into hatred.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,660
(It was fake!
Everything was just an act.)

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,644
(He is actually an alcoholic.
He always asks for trouble when drunk)

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,488
(He’s a whore!
And this whore smells fishy!)

23
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:09,460
(Do you have proof? My baby is a nice person.)

24
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,820
(His fans have clear skin.
As for you, go see a doctor, please.)

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,310
(What do you mean smells fishy?
Do you have a video to prove? Haha)

26
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,955
(Tomorrow afternoon, I’ll leak it.)

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,200
(War Of Y)
(Episode 8)

28
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,400
Bew.

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,990
I never did as per plan.

30
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,209
Everything that I did.

31
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,250
I truly feel it.

32
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,377
Okay.

33
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:04,870
That take was very good.

34
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,542
Now stop acting and tell the truth.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
Til now.

36
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,542
It's the truth.

37
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,209
You didn't agree.

38
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:17,888
But you didn't disagree too.

39
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,950
I couldn't.

40
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,687
I was scared there would be a problem.

41
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:24,876
So.

42
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,417
Didn't say anything.

43
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,459
And just let it go.

44
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Good.

45
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:32,999
Damn, you get everything.

46
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,417
Do as planned.

47
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,542
Get things your way.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you really loved me.

49
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:41,918
Why didn't you tell me.

50
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,334
I didn't know how to.

51
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,032
I was scared you will get hurt.

52
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,792
And do you think I am hurt.

53
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,584
I am sorry.

54
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:56,918
I promise

55
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,375
I won't hurt you again.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
It hurts.

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,500
I was stupid not to see it.

58
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,292
You don't mean that much to me.

59
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,626
You have to say this?

60
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,443
You don't have to come console me.

61
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:17,834
And don't worry.

62
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,876
I will do the projects the same.

63
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,999
Like nothing has happened.

64
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,125
We are actors.

65
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,319
Just pretending in front of moms.

66
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,751
And FC.

67
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,209
You can do it all already.

68
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,999
Oh! These days we are busy rehearsing.

69
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:07,940
So we don't have time to come and live.

70
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,767
(We missed you! Please do a live broadcast more often.)
So we don't have time to come and live.

71
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:09,380
(It can just a minute. It’s fine.)
Yes.

72
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:09,876
(I can’t wait for the concert.)
Yes.

73
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:10,740
(Bew, did you get our food? #Bews_Guardians)
If I make a mistake, Bew will scold me.

74
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,420
(See? They’re still friends.)
If I make a mistake, Bew will scold me.

75
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,918
(I’m glad they aren’t like what the news says.)
If I make a mistake, Bew will scold me.

76
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,417
(My Bew is the class president. Now punish Gus for us please. Haha.)
He looks cute like a cat.

77
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,375
But hes really a tiger.

78
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,626
A tiny tiger.

79
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
(They’re not fighting. They’re in love!)

80
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,660
(Stop spreading fake news! See their smiles?)
No, not aggressive.

81
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,120
(Maybe it’s their managers who are fighting.)
No, not aggressive.

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,620
(Right? I think Toon and Pla are fighting.)

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,222
(Toon and Pla, please don’t fight.)

84
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,334
Oh, it's not that. Look at this.

85
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,250
Mom, come here.

86
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,667
Mom, quick.

87
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,120
(Their moms! I missed Pla on IG)

88
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,780
(Please, put a stop to the fake news.
I’m tired of those antis.) Hi.

89
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,375
(Her makeup? Did she know she
was going to be on this live?) NHi.

90
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:33,959
(You’re doing this because of the rumour.
We can see through the act, please.)

91
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,959
(Please visit my online shop! #DongSangSalmonInSoySauce DM please.)
Someone says that you don't get along.

92
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Can you show them if it's true.

93
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,820
(I think we have a new coupe.
# PlaToon #ToonPla)

94
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,620
(They kissed! So cute!)

95
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,940
(They’re so fake.)

96
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,700
(Bew’s smile can light up the universe!)

97
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,222
See?

98
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,999
They are almost like a new ship.

99
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:44,542
Umm.

100
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:45,459
(Well, please stay together for a really long time.)
For today.

101
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:46,500
(Can you stay a little longer?)
Thank you very much.

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,209
(You’re leaving? Please, stay.)
Thank you very much.

103
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:47,860
(I haven’t seen you in a while. Now, it’s time to say goodbye?)
We will have to go back to our rehearsals.

104
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,260
(Stay longer please. This is too short.)
We will have to go back to our rehearsals.

105
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,014
We will have to go back to our rehearsals.

106
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,375
Yes and see you again.

107
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,375
Bye.

108
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,866
(Wait, Bew. Did you see the clip?)

109
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,334
What clip?

110
00:06:58,822 --> 00:06:59,340
(Why did you brought that up?
We agreed not to tell him, remember?)

111
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,266
(Bew, please don’t go to Twitter.)

112
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,822
(Have you seen your face
in the clip. Now I’m horny.)

113
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:01,370
(Why would say say such
disgusting thing? Report him, please!)

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,800
Bew.

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,800
(Oh my freakin’ god!
A raunchy video clip surfaced online.)

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
(Oh my freakin' god!)

117
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,222
(A raunchy video clip surfaced online.
And it looks like a certain BL actor.)

118
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,220
(#BewNotSmall is now trending on Twitter
What will the actor say about this?)

119
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,900
(It’s so hot. I couldn’t stop jerking.)

120
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,140
(I saw someone else's hand
in the clip too. #BewNotSmall)

121
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,820
(Alright, the fun is over!
Stop trending the hashtag! You morons!)

122
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,266
(Is that really Bew #BewNotSmall)

123
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,244
Yes.

124
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:41,933
The person in the clip, is me.

125
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,918
That time, I was young.

126
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,667
So I didn't think carefully.

127
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,500
But someone noticed that.

128
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,709
Your hairstyle is the same as now.

129
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,222
The picture is distorted.

130
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,042
And a long time ago.

131
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,751
Whatever he's saying.

132
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:07,022
Believe him.

133
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:07,933
Please.

134
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,577
Hello everyone.

135
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,244
Can I say something.

136
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,125
Taking clips like these.

137
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,292
It's a privacy matter.

138
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,834
The person wrong.

139
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,209
Is the person who released the clip.

140
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,792
And invaded privacy without the owners consent.

141
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,209
Bew is the victim here.

142
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,209
He shouldn’t be blamed.

143
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,133
We should blame the person who did this.

144
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,751
I want the society and the FC's.

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,755
To understand Bew.

146
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:34,800
Thank you.

147
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,751
- How could you do this to me.
- Bew.

148
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,459
How could you.

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,125
Calm down.

150
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,088
Calm down Bew.

151
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,955
I didn't do it.

152
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,422
Stop being crazy Toon.

153
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,792
I don't know

154
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,711
I didn't do it.

155
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,417
You were angry about Gus.

156
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:19,125
And did this to my child.

157
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:24,792
If not then who?

158
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,792
You were the one to take the clip.

159
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,834
You said you loved me and all.

160
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,334
But hurt me in the end.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What the heck's wrong.

162
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,334
Didn't do it?

163
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,334
Stop faking.

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,250
Gus.

166
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,999
Do you understand.

167
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,955
Toon.

168
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,444
Listen to me.

169
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,876
That clip came from 'detective girl'

170
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,709
And that account.

171
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,626
Took the clip from your IG to spread.

172
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,777
That Gus was addicted to alcohol.

173
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,088
I think it's you.

174
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,330
Detective girl'

175
00:10:59,417 --> 00:10:59,959
You only.

176
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,844
Posted this clip of your child.

177
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,777
Was it mommy Toon?

178
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,755
Mommy Toon?

179
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,709
Why would she do that.

180
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,250
For your Top spender campaign Bew.

181
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:12,834
Here.

182
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,125
Everyone.

183
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,876
Please buy Pure Skin.

184
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,999
To help increase sales for Bew.

185
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:19,918
Here.

186
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,533
You are calling for publicity.

187
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,236
You are so good at making stories.

188
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,444
I am so tired.

189
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,876
Why do I have to face all these.

190
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,622
Change all the passwords Bew.

191
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:49,955
I've changed mine too.

192
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,200
What if Toon didn't do it.

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,355
You shouldn't trust her that much Bew.

194
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,222
You are not trustworthy.

195
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,159
Is this another plan of yours.

196
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,120
What plan?

197
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,400
I already told you I love you.

198
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,044
Love?

199
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,333
Love so much that you had to come
and protect me during the press.

200
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,177
I saw in the hashtag.

201
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,355
P' Gus must be as hurt as Bew.

202
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,511
Let's buy to increase his Top spender.

203
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,159
You can only think this much?

204
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,209
I don't know what to say.

205
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,959
Then don't say.

206
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,222
Go back.

207
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,750
Go.

208
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,709
What do you want to do.

209
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,488
This concert, should we postpone.

210
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:06,022
Or just cancel it.

211
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:07,959
And announce separation.

212
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,410
And end this.

213
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,167
No way.

214
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,688
You think you can run away from problems.

215
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,644
Sorry.

216
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,290
The person running away.

217
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,333
And pushing everything to me.

218
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,700
Is you.

219
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:26,022
If you want to accuse me. Get evidence.

220
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,330
And then come talk.

221
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:52,244
(Gus came to his rescue!
“Victim blaming should be stopped!”)

222
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,393
(Next Break)
Can't we live a little longer P' Toon?

223
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,375
Do you like? Faking in front of others.

224
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:57,751
Hello.

225
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,709
- Yo.
- Yo is drunk.

226
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:01,450
Come and get him.

227
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,999
Everyone, stay calm.

228
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,800
What are you throwing for

229
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,577
I've printed all the evidence.

230
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,622
So you can't blame me anymore.

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,755
And why did you call us here?

232
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,355
I asked someone to check the IP address.

233
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,049
And found that.

234
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,340
Detective Girl's account.

235
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,022
Was used here.

236
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,216
Always logged in.

237
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:45,339
Wait.

238
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,840
This is central computer.

239
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Anyone can use it.

240
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,688
Even you and Toon

241
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Gus and Bew.

242
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,755
Right.

243
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,777
And that clip was very personal.

244
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,422
And how would we have that clip?

245
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,750
Why would we use the computer here?

246
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,733
Huh.

247
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,174
Sis.

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,133
For hiding.

249
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,822
If you check the IP address.

250
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,488
You won't know who did it. Right?

251
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:18,382
You?

252
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,666
Don't fight.

253
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:22,715
I don't know.

254
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,086
If no ones taking the blame.

255
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,933
I am going to sue the company.

256
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,111
Sure.

257
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,600
Lets talk in the court.

258
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,244
Bew.

259
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,422
A good manager.

260
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,290
Can handle everything.

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
What about your mom?

262
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,339
Can she handle anything?

263
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:58,465
Let's go.

264
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,740
(What about the bracelet in the clip?
Is it Gus’s? Please find out, you guys!)

265
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,340
(I’m so disappointed in Bew.)

266
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,020
(It would be shocking if Gus
was the one who leaked it.)

267
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,220
(I thought he was a baby. Now I can’t
look at him that way anymore.)

268
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,820
(Thank you, whoever you are, for leaking
the clip! Now I know he isn’t small.)

269
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,420
(The clip has been taken down on Twitter,
but it’s still on other sites. DM if you want to see.)

270
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,040
(I can’t look at him
without thinking about that clip!)

271
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,800
(Why are you talking
as if it was his fault? Please stop.)

272
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,940
(It’s not his fault,
but I can’t accept it.)

273
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,888
(That account is so disgusting!
You guys please, report them!)

274
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,140
(You know this is sexual harassment
and victim shaming, right?)

275
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,620
(Actors can’t have sex or what?)

276
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,660
(What if he killed himself
because of what happened?)

277
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,150
(You’re pushing him off the cliff.
The blood will be on your hands!)

278
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:57,110
(Don’t do anything stupid. Bew.)

279
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,955
Hi Pee.

280
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,222
Hey Bew.

281
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,511
And you are Gus?

282
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,022
How did you come.

283
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:25,911
Well.

284
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,644
I have some work around here.

285
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,155
And.

286
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:32,966
Anything?

287
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,997
I've been through all this Bew.

288
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:42,924
If you can't take it.

289
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:44,882
Don't force it.

290
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,955
Take a break. Everything will be better.

291
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,311
No matter what happens.

292
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,111
The person beside you is the most important.

293
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,743
Don't let other peoples problems.

294
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,688
Hurt your relationship.

295
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,088
Wait.

296
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,549
You know about this?

297
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,377
This industry is small.

298
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,966
Everyone knows everything.

299
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,355
In the war plan that we didn't start.

300
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,244
Anyway.

301
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,419
Lets take a selfie together.

302
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,177
Sure.

303
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,644
Let me take a selfie as

304
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,549
Gus Bew's FC

305
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,339
1, 2

306
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,177
I'll tag you.

307
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,533
Both of you.

308
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,333
Thank you.

309
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,177
I'm going.

310
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,132
See you later.

311
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:38,970
(You will always have
my support! My brother!)

312
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:44,266
(You will always have
my support! My brother!)

313
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:50,540
(Thank you P’s fans for your support.
Please be nice to my baby. He’s nice.)

314
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,420
(It shouldn’t happen to him.)

315
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,900
(Anyone here thinks P and Bew
look good together?)

316
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,700
(I’m a P’s fan but I think I fell for Bew.
You have my support, Bew.)

317
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,244
(I’ll support whoever P supports.)

318
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,632
Still love.

319
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,258
Love?

320
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,840
Love as big as a giant.

321
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,382
Do you know.

322
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:03,632
That love love love.

323
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:05,216
So big.

324
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,715
Have to say love.

325
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,608
Love.

326
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:10,174
Cuddling.

327
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:10,757
Yeah.

328
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,340
Just having you.

329
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,174
Stay like this.

330
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Forever.

331
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,674
And ever.

332
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:18,590
Let's go.

333
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,674
So.

334
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,111
P' Gus.

335
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:21,549
(Bew is smiling again! I’m so happy!)

336
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,109
(They’re hugging. Gus is at it again. Toon, help him please.)
Why are you hugging, it's not in there.

337
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,423
(Bew, have you seen the Top Spender’s
expense? It’s 250k already.) Have, it has.

338
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,799
(Where’s that detective girl now? See?
They’re still shining and together!) So smooth.

339
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,688
See you later everyone.

340
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:37,074
Can't we live a little longer Toon.

341
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:39,423
You like it?

342
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,133
Faking in front of others.

343
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,577
But for me it's true.

344
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,377
Can't we just believe like that.

345
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:52,799
You can.

346
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,715
But I will never be the same.

347
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,977
I told you.

348
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,822
Don't get too in.

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,755
It's just.

350
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,000
FC service plan.

351
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,590
I think.

352
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,377
After the concert I will let you play a channel series.

353
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,590
The ship can only go this far.

354
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,222
You only want publicity right?

355
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,382
My feelings don't matter?

356
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,311
I am human too.

357
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,133
Yes.

358
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,200
You are.

359
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,288
But not just a normal person.

360
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,966
You are people's person.

361
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,216
You are an actor.

362
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,444
A product on the shelf.

363
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,022
Just think.

364
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:33,799
If one day the production
the shelf cannot be sold.

365
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,423
No matter how much you promote or give it out.

366
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:39,632
No one will buy.

367
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,955
In the end.

368
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,644
It expires.

369
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:47,844
And then what.

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,330
It's just taken away from the shelf.

371
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:03,049
And everything that we've done since the beginning.

372
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,800
Will go to waste.

373
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:07,977
Understand?

374
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:15,715
Enough.

375
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,555
You go make yourself believable.

376
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,710
Go make yourself lively.

377
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,044
Smile. Go.

378
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,711
Make yourself happy.

379
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,590
About Bew.

380
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,377
Let it go.

381
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,444
We can't back out now.

382
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,266
Move forward.

383
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:07,740
(Are you mad at me for
what I said earlier today?)

384
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,420
(Can I go to your house?
Please, talk to me. Don’t be like this.)

385
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,140
(I’ll bring in some food, too.)

386
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,700
(You’re selfish. You know how long
I’ve been waiting at your door?)

387
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,111
(I love you, Bew.)

388
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,340
(Toon)

389
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,800
Hello. Whats wrong with Bew?

390
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,882
Nothing. I'm worried about you.

391
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,688
Can I come meet you.

392
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:39,210
Oh wow. What do you see me as.

393
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,733
Hello.

394
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,466
Hello!

395
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,755
Yo?

396
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,377
Yo.

397
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,216
Yo is shit drunk.
Come and take him back.

398
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,088
Yeah, okay I'll be there.

399
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,091
No, don't want.

400
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,800
(Gus is here.)

401
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:47,966
Did you see Yo?

402
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:05,549
Yo.

403
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:22,577
(Yo, where the hell are you?
I’m here to pick you up. Where are you?)

404
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,674
This is the police. All remain calm.

405
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:29,757
What.

406
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:30,924
What the hell.

407
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:35,966
What.

408
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:45,507
What the hell is this.

409
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:46,966
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

410
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,339
Hey.

411
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,977
Yo was tensed that I would sue his company.

412
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,333
So he created a scene.

413
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,044
You went in to get him.

414
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:01,511
Huh.

415
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,533
So believable Gus.

416
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,800
It's true.

417
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:07,632
And now what.

418
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,688
Did you see him?

419
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,422
You are too good.

420
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,155
How many times have I told you
not to be friends with people like this.

421
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,066
Yo is my friend.

422
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,777
But he got you in trouble.

423
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:22,924
But I think.

424
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,777
This whole thing.

425
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,244
Is because of Toon.

426
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:30,549
They planned this to discredit you.

427
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,049
Hey.

428
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,466
Why do you always drag to drama.

429
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,222
This world.

430
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,499
There isn't only you and Toon.

431
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,311
Think of me too.

432
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:41,339
You think.

433
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,044
To go find him but did you see him.

434
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,171
Don't you think it's weird.

435
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,258
How did the police come.

436
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,466
It wasn't in the plan.

437
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,733
I don't know.

438
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,488
There were drugs in the party.

439
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:59,466
If Gus goes to jail.

440
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,844
It's not on me.

441
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,316
(Next Break)
I must thank P' Pla.

442
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,924
For finding evidence to help me.

443
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,656
But the person who got the evidence.

444
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,777
Wasn't it Cartoon and Bew.

445
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:32,422
If you want to stay together

446
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,800
Gus has to be on my side.

447
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:53,332
Regarding K. Kasidet's case,
the series Y actor,

448
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:56,160
The religious award winner.

449
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:59,375
- Who was arrested for being involved.
- Change the channel Bew.

450
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,422
Right now...

451
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,000
His urine is not purple.

452
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:08,700
But he was there.

453
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,200
He's still in trouble.

454
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:12,040
What bad luck.

455
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:13,780
So sad for him, right Bew?

456
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:19,844
Bew. Sis already got a lawyer.

457
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:22,660
And the hearing is in 48 hours.

458
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:26,200
If they can prove he was there at the wrong place, wrong time.

459
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:27,311
He's safe.

460
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:28,955
Hmm.

461
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:43,708
Today is mother son day.

462
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:46,660
Why don't you go change and lets go for dinner.

463
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,733
Which police station is Gus at?

464
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:04,822
Bew, you want to go see him?

465
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:07,777
Are you not angry anymore.

466
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:28,644
I'm so happy.

467
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,690
At least you still worry about me.

468
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,410
For humanity sake.

469
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:42,950
How are you.

470
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:44,511
Can you stay.

471
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,280
How are you eating and sleeping.

472
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,933
It's difficult.

473
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,250
Beds are not as soft as yours.

474
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,600
Is it worth it? To play drugs.

475
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:56,666
What are you stressed about.

476
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,790
I didn't play.

477
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,355
But I was stressed.

478
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I was stressed.

479
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:12,000
Because I missed you.

480
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,620
I am worried about you.

481
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Let me go.

482
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,844
It hurts.

483
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,555
Goodluck.

484
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,222
Hope you come out soon.

485
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,733
Well.

486
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,444
From the evidence.

487
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,000
It shows that Gus was there, but.

488
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,790
He went to find a friend.

489
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:46,870
Which

490
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,830
Gus has no involvement.

491
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
With the party.

492
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,330
From the CCTV.

493
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,210
Helps to prove that Gus.

494
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,000
Was there.

495
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,580
Not even 5 minutes.

496
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,250
And the friend he was talking about.

497
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,000
Is Gus's friend.

498
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,977
They've known each other for long.
Since childhood. His name is...

499
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:04,666
Yo.

500
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,466
Yo.

501
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,622
Yo.

502
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,244
Yo.

503
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,088
Yo has already resigned.

504
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,022
Resigned?

505
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,155
Since when? How come I don't know?

506
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:23,977
He didn't come to work for 2-3 days.

507
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,533
I will give you his number.
And you can contact him.

508
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:30,777
Fast, fast, fast.

509
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,422
Oye.

510
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:54,488
Right now.

511
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,866
Hes busy.

512
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,710
So he can't be here today.

513
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,000
But we spoke to the owner.

514
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,511
Who was also caught with Gus

515
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,888
Gus doesn't know the house owner
or anyone in the party.

516
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,533
You can see, when Yo left the house.

517
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,422
Before the police came.

518
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,977
Even if It's distorted.

519
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,244
But can see that he wasn't drunk.

520
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,777
Or creating a scene.

521
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,177
That Gus had to go help.

522
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,688
Wait.

523
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,133
Are you saying that Yo planned
the whole thing to discredit his friend?

524
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,533
It's.

525
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:39,511
Me and Yo are friends.

526
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,933
There is no reason for him to trick me

527
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,644
Gus has had alcohol addiction.

528
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,933
If like this. You think we can trust.

529
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,933
Wrong place, wrong time.

530
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,733
It's.

531
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Please, lawyer.

532
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,250
The court believes you.

533
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,955
So we have given our decision.

534
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,133
As no fault.

535
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,111
How are you feeling now Gus.

536
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,466
Very relieved. And

537
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,222
I must thank P' Pla.

538
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,066
For finding evidence to help me.

539
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,488
So I am free

540
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:15,733
Gus.

541
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,444
Here is the evidence from me and the lawyer.

542
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Thank you P' Toon.

543
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:23,460
Thank you Bew.

544
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,755
No need to thank me.

545
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,600
A good manager.

546
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,177
Can handle everything.

547
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,022
Sis.

548
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Why are you helping

549
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,355
I'm doing for Bew.

550
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,088
Bew has asked me to.

551
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Today.

552
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,488
Thank you you all.

553
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,400
For staying by myside.

554
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,822
I promise.

555
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,460
Not to let this happen again.

556
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,022
If no more questions.

557
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Excuse us.

558
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,400
The person who found the evidence.
Wasn't it Cartoon and Bew?

559
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,420
(It was Toon who saved Gus.
What was Pla doing?)

560
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,580
(Pla? I thought his name was Whale.)

561
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,260
(Remember when Gus was accused of being
an alcoholic? He didn’t do anything either.)

562
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:33,488
(Pla looks stupid, but I didn’t
think he would be this stupid.)

563
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,980
(Leave him, Gus!)

564
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,180
(Leave Pla and hire Toon as your manager.
Maybe I’ll get to see you and Bew more often.)

565
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,350
(You can’t calling him Whale?
That’s body shaming.)

566
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,860
(Whale, please think
about what you’ve done wrong.)

567
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:01,911
(He didn’t do anything either when he was working
with Candy. All he did was being funny.)

568
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:06,500
(#Pla_You_Dying_Whale!)

569
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,660
(Stop calling him that!)

570
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,977
(You guys are disgusting.
Your parents raised you this way?)

571
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:14,420
(So what if I call him Whale? I don’t see
a problem with it. Gus went to jail because of him!)

572
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,570
(That wasn’t Pla’s fault!
He did all he could at the time.)

573
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:26,550
(#Pla_You_Dying_Whale!)

574
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Phi.

575
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,155
I made your favourite.

576
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Have something.

577
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,460
You haven't eaten all day.

578
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Whats wrong.

579
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
What happened?

580
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,622
I tried everything Gus.

581
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,177
But it doesn't work.

582
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm bashed, that's more than enough.

583
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,644
But they are bullying me.

584
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,355
What do I do.

585
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,750
Tired.

586
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,044
If anything, talk to me.

587
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,750
No need to be fierce.

588
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:46,120
No need to be strong everyday.

589
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,250
Come here.

590
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:29,488
(Toon)

591
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:32,580
(Honestly, if it weren’t for Toon,
Gus would’ve gone to jail for good.)

592
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,500
(You disgusting whale, leave him!)

593
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,844
(Toon: I had to help him considering
he’s my future son-in-law. Hehe.)

594
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Is it fun.

595
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,355
He's been through so much.

596
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,933
Why still bashing.

597
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,555
Bew.

598
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,488
If I allow him to hurt us always.

599
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:54,533
Then we will always be the prey.

600
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,500
Sis wanted to. Separate you two.

601
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,511
Do you want to separate?

602
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,244
I know that you still love Gus.

603
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,533
If you still want to be together

604
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Gus has to be on our side.

605
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:15,933
You have to do that much?

606
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,290
Yes. That extent.

607
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:20,888
I will be honest.

608
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:22,755
Don't get angry.

609
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,710
It's.

610
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,088
For you.

611
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:29,311
Can't sell anything else.

612
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,000
Other than shipping.

613
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,422
And a ship that is broken.

614
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,288
Won't survive.

615
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Sell?

616
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,400
Can't get beyond this word.

617
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,822
You want to sell ship.

618
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,133
Or go back to selling papaya salad.

619
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:06,422
Bew.

620
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:07,911
Look.

621
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,555
This is what you wanted.

622
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,422
I am doing everything.

623
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,777
Everything so you can survive in this industry.

624
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,400
But Gus has to be on my side.

625
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:26,088
If Gus is on my side.

626
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,711
You will have a boyfriend.

627
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,750
A house. Money.

628
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,755
Happiness.

629
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,222
Here.

630
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:35,200
Everything you ever wanted.

631
00:42:41,022 --> 00:42:41,420
(The history repeats itself.)

632
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,300
(First it was Nott and Pan.)

633
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:42,740
(Now their managers are fighting
and it puts a strain on Bew and Gus!)

634
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,200
(Gus’s fans are asking
him to leave Pla.)

635
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,810
(Next Break)
Now you even deal directly without passing through me

636
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:49,170
I think Gus wants a new manager.

637
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,250
I think.

638
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,022
We should.

639
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,870
Go and find someone else.

640
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,866
Not going, means not going.

641
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,777
Single event is more important.

642
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,977
Single event is more important.

643
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,000
Or the money is more important.

644
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,640
Accept the truth sis.

645
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:20,800
I didn't want anything with you anymore.

646
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,190
Since the press conference.

647
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,200
But you keep having problems.

648
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,066
Okay.

649
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,333
Alright, sis

650
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,400
I will take myself.

651
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,377
To say sorry to the FC.

652
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,350
If the FC finds out.

653
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:37,150
The person to ruin the ship is you.

654
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
It's not my problem.

655
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:42,644
You shallow thinker.

656
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:44,444
Damn it Toon.

657
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Hmm.

658
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,730
You promised, you won't fight.

659
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,133
Toon started it.

660
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:55,600
I was just reminding him what we spoke about.

661
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:57,800
Spoke what

662
00:43:59,266 --> 00:43:59,733
Gus.

663
00:44:00,311 --> 00:44:01,288
What did you speak to her.

664
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:03,755
Well.

665
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:05,244
P' Toon called me.

666
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,066
About.

667
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,022
To go on a reality show with Bew.

668
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,800
And I wanted to go for a long time.

669
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,100
So I agreed.

670
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,560
You dare deal directly with him,
without me knowing.

671
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:19,733
Huh.

672
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,155
I am still his manager.

673
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:25,244
What do you want by doing this.

674
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,000
A manager. Then act like one.

675
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,310
If I didn't help the case

676
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,444
Gus would've been in jail.

677
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,933
And what kind of manager.

678
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,560
Is emotional unstable.

679
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,466
That he has to console you.

680
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:49,977
Gus.

681
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,711
You even told her about this

682
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,000
Gus tells me everything.

683
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,555
I think Gus.

684
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,555
Wants to change his manager.

685
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:01,520
Damn it Toon.

686
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,730
Hey.

687
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,230
What are you doing, P' Pla.

688
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,980
Sis, you want it like this.

689
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,980
You.

690
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,266
Mom.

691
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,270
Stop.

692
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
Stop.

693
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,190
Enough.

694
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,350
You slapped my child.

695
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,350
Yeah, so what.

696
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,333
Oye.

697
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:23,866
Bew.

698
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:28,230
The story started with managers.

699
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,644
But the person affected.

700
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,333
Are not managers.

701
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:34,911
How is this fair.

702
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,980
That time, was really good.

703
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,150
Let me ask you.

704
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,560
Are we real or just a ship.

705
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
How will our future be.

706
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,333
Then let me ask you back.

707
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,690
Umm.

708
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,140
If there wasn't this plan.

709
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,777
How would you be.

710
00:46:47,288 --> 00:46:48,480
I would.

711
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:50,911
Be close to you the same.

712
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,060
Slowly love you the same.

713
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,270
I might have known myself slower.

714
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,810
But we won't be fighting as much as now.

715
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,111
I had a dream. I want to build a house like that.

716
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,400
Get my mom and siblings to stay together.

717
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,480
Have a room for P' Toon.

718
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,600
And do you have a room for me?

719
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,690
It's damaged.

720
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Damaged so repair it.

721
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,444
I will help.

722
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,600
Imagine.
If we cut out the managers drama.

723
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,400
Mommy Toon told me that.

724
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
Y couple, if not the same manager.

725
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,288
Will not survive.

726
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,480
She told me the same thing.

727
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,900
Last night she called me.

728
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,190
Asking me to leave P' Pla.

729
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,155
And what do you say.

730
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,022
It might be good.

731
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:33,444
So there won't be conflict of interest.

732
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,222
There won't really be?

733
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:42,177
P' Pla will never agree.

734
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,020
I think.

735
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,210
We need to get away from both of them.

736
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,111
Like go find someone else.

737
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:59,870
But they've taken care of us for so long.

738
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,270
Won't that be disloyal.

739
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:06,688
I've always thought.

740
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,377
How we reached here today.

741
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,520
Is because of ourselves.

742
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
We.

743
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,730
Don't need them anymore.

744
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,150
In fact they.

745
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Need us.

746
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,150
If we allow them to hurt us.

747
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,066
We will always be the prey.

748
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,755
If the result.

749
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
P' Pla and P' Toon.

750
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,580
We can end with them without looking bad.

751
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,350
We are fine as before?

752
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,555
That will never happen Gus.

753
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,311
But it will be even better.

754
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:26,333
(Bew’s Guardian:
have you seen this, Bew?)

755
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:27,340
(See? They’re fighting. That’s why my baby
doesn’t work as much as before.)

756
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,540
(I want to see Pla and Toon in a catfight?
Who’s with me?)

757
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,260
(That gay man, Pla, will definitely win
if they decide to hold a boxing match.)

758
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,844
(You guys support violence, body shaming,
and you’re homophobic, too?)

759
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,600
(Koon: I knew this would happen!)
Who has possessed you.

760
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,640
(Candy: He betrayed me. Of course, he would betray his friend, too.)
Come and take the merit.

761
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:43,980
(Can they do a live during the rehearsal?)

762
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,377
(I told you… something was wrong!)

763
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:47,260
(Pla, you’re overworking Gus!)

764
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,700
(Of course, the manager wants him to work hard.
The more he works, the more money to the manager.)

765
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,933
(Gus looks tired and sad these says.)

766
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,700
(Bew looks so sad.)

767
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,220
(Please, bring back his smile!)

768
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,333
(He looks so sad. Let’s buy more of his product
so we could enter Top Spender’s list)

769
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,020
Bew.

770
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,000
Let's go, come on.

771
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:03,688
Quick.

772
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
No need for that, it isn't appropriate.

773
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,288
Come here.

774
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,933
Quick.

775
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,560
Lets go eat Italian food
at a Michelin star restaurant.

776
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,480
Let's go.

777
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,770
It's so appropriate.

778
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,520
For 200k top spender.

779
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,488
Lets go.

780
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,222
Go.

781
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,311
Hey.

782
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:42,311
We can't stay like this anymore.

783
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,480
It's time Gus.

784
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,044
Hello

785
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,888
Katie.

786
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:36,577
Yeah.

787
00:54:36,977 --> 00:54:39,844
I want some nice baskets.

788
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,444
About 2-3.

789
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,400
For my clients.

790
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:45,150
Yes.

791
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,270
My child is getting a lot of presenter jobs.

792
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,850
I’m so tired.

793
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,560
Yeah.

794
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,533
Please take care for me, thank you.

795
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,190
Hmm.

796
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,022
Don't you think It's weird.

797
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,066
Why.

798
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,133
Look at their top spender.

799
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,000
How did she get.

800
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:01,822
Yeah.

801
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,444
How did she afford it.

802
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,730
She's still young.

803
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,355
And.

804
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,155
Looks like she doesn't have money.

805
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,800
State.

806
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:09,844
Really.

807
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,100
It's not weird, you know why?

808
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:19,520
Because they cheated.

809
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,422
How did we cheat Toon.

810
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,600
Here.

811
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,270
Low and shallow minimums.

812
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:28,230
And getting jealous of others.

813
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,466
That's not nice.

814
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,640
Really.

815
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,777
Lookpla.

816
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,577
When you scold someone.
It always comes back to you.

817
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:41,560
I know, you used your money to pay.

818
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,644
In the end, before the results came.

819
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:45,400
Lets talk else where.

820
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:47,666
I will say it here.

821
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:55,666
Sis, didn't you tell me.

822
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,520
That I like publicity.

823
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,940
So talk it here.

824
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:04,022
You used your own money to pay.

825
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,690
And made a deal with her. Move.

826
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,088
To be a top spender instead of you.

827
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,511
Isn't it right?

828
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:16,400
Don't be disrespectful to my childs FC.

829
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,644
And taking my own money to buy.
Why would I do that?

830
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,444
You told me yourself.

831
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:24,440
You told me.

832
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,150
That more jobs will come in.

833
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,466
The 300K.

834
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,310
We will get it back soon.

835
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,400
What the heck are you saying.

836
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,440
You are accusing me. Do you have proof?

837
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,020
Yes I do I have evidence.

838
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,822
Do you want it? Here?

839
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:41,310
In front of the media.

840
00:56:42,644 --> 00:56:43,533
Wanna.

841
00:56:46,955 --> 00:56:47,688
How.

842
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:48,733
Speechless.

843
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,511
Oh or did I misunderstand something.

844
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,111
Oh.

845
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,044
Or.

846
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,444
The money used.

847
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:02,022
Isn't.

848
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,822
Yours.

849
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,190
Damn you.

850
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,177
Enough.

851
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,466
Because of your fight, bew was hit.
Isn't that enough.

852
00:57:14,577 --> 00:57:16,133
You guys fight.

853
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,690
We are not at all happy.

854
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,177
We are stressed almost going crazy.

855
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,866
If this continues.

856
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,977
We cannot work together anymore.

857
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,640
It's time. We've been waiting for.

858
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,100
The war is the same as always.

859
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,560
Wherever.

860
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,560
Whatever time.

861
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,730
People with power fight.

862
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:22,850
To keep their dignity.

863
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:25,244
In the end.

864
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:27,666
For their interest.

865
00:58:29,488 --> 00:58:31,850
People who get hurt or die.

866
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:38,100
Are asked to accept it.

867
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,270
Even if.

868
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,850
They don't get anything in return.

869
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:45,100
(They’re so over. Bew said he doesn’t
want to work with Gus anymore.)

870
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,733
(Now they can finally stop being fake.)

871
00:58:49,066 --> 00:58:49,816
(#You_Disgusting_Whale
#Toon_You_Clout_Chaser!)

872
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:51,222
If you know this.

873
00:58:51,555 --> 00:58:53,266
What would you do.

874
00:58:53,844 --> 00:58:55,730
Fight until the other one dies.

875
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,088
(Toon)

876
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,222
Or choose to join hands.

877
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,440
And bring the enemy down.

878
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:17,222
(Yo)

879
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,640
(Next Week)
We want to announce postponing our concert

880
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:28,980
Gus Bew Scent of Love Live until further notice.

881
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,200
I told you to announce separation.

882
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,520
Before when you do this.

883
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:34,377
They will manipulate and
say you don't want to separate.

884
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,840
And you asked for this yourself.

885
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,900
When you wanted to play Y series.

886
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,488
You made me break up with my girlfriend.

887
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,133
Now you want me to play couple series.

888
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:42,400
And you want me to Separate from Bew.

889
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:44,133
Don't I have the right to love.

890
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:46,100
The person you should love the most.

891
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,190
Is me.

892
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,600
And stealing my money.

893
00:59:48,977 --> 00:59:50,100
Is that for me as well?
