00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,313
My best boy.

16
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:23,977
Thank you mom.

17
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,044
Are you tensed?

18
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,088
Bew.

19
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:53,546
Why are you so tensed.

20
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,204
Even if theres a mistake, no one would say anything.

21
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,400
Everyone who is coming here today, loves you.

22
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,377
Hmm.

23
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:07,613
Just remember.
That this meeting is your biggest dream.

24
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,480
I know mom.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,244
I just.

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,520
Don't want to disappoint you.

27
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,504
You've done so much for me.

28
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,933
I want to do this properly to thank you.

29
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,440
Listen to me and look into the mirror.

30
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:31,800
You need to give yourself some credit.

31
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:34,600
You are so talented and so hard working.

32
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,066
Do not underestimate yourself.

33
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,590
You are really talented.

34
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:40,911
No more sulking.

35
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:44,490
If you do, I am going to whine really loudly.

36
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,377
Hmm..

37
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,020
- Ok mom, no more sulking.
- Good boy.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,844
Promise?

39
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,693
Let me see the queue.

40
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:04,390
I think we can get this up first.

41
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,440
And we can try to call Gus to get here in time.

42
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,577
Disperse.

43
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,270
What's wrong?

44
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,355
Drunk or not awake or what?

45
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,200
He picked up my call this morning.

46
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,022
Wonder if something happened.

47
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,466
Sis.

48
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,756
Calm down.

49
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,250
Calm down.

50
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,275
Nothing happened.

51
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,473
You go prepare the plan and I will call him for you.

52
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,377
Okay?

53
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,053
- Okay!
- Okay.

54
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:20,777
(Bew)

55
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,086
Where are you Gus? P' Pao here is freaking out.

56
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,311
There's a lot of traffic here.

57
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,553
Im hanging up first.

58
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,494
A lot of traffic but the background is very quiet.

59
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,638
You are still at home right?

60
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,153
You know me well.

61
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:39,822
Did you just wake up?

62
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,380
Quickly call and tell Pla.

63
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,711
I dont want to get scolded.

64
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,088
Can you tell for me.

65
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,244
No, call her yourself.

66
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,046
Please.

67
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,830
Please tell her for me.

68
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,430
My dear brother.

69
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:57,237
Okay!

70
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,377
Tell me to do things everytime, P' Gus.

71
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,355
P' Gus.

72
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,377
Umm.

73
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,177
Do you remember what day is it today?

74
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:07,270
Its the fan meeting day.

75
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,088
Umm.

76
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,113
Bye.

77
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,311
Bew.

78
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,622
It's almost time.
Why haven't you put on your shirt.

79
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,777
Let me help you.

80
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,777
Hey.

81
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,155
He din't pick up my call.

82
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,560
Let me go check on him.

83
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,800
Mom.

84
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,288
It's...

85
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,733
Gus's car.

86
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,204
Broke down.

87
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,288
But he's left home.
He's on his way here.

88
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,044
Left home?

89
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:58,733
But his car broke down.

90
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
Or on his way?

91
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,180
What the hells going on?

92
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,866
And why isnt he answering my calls?

93
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,950
He might be on the call with the insurance.
That's why.

94
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,770
That's why he isn't answering.

95
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:13,022
Talking to the insurance.

96
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,844
But still has time to talk to you.

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,260
(- Did it start?
- When will it start?)

98
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,700
(Stop with the countdown!
When are you going to start?)

99
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,380
(We're waiting for you, Bew.)

100
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,860
(Are we still waiting or
the event has already started?)

101
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,577
(You should've told us
it's gonna be late.)

102
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
P' Toon.

(Voice: The FC have started whining)

104
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:27,740
Hello Everyone!

105
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,220
(It's here!)
Hello Everyone!

106

(Finally.)
Hello Everyone!

107

(It's her again?)
Hello Everyone!

108
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:32,000
(She's become the face of the meet and
greet entertainment at this point.)

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,977
(I hope she keeps the
introduction short this time.)

110
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,020
And welcome all the fans to.

111
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,140
(Stop wasting our time.
Show us the boys already!)
And welcome all the fans to.

112
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,266
(Can't you wait?
The show is just getting started.)
And welcome all the fans to.

113

off stage if I were there.)

Learn how to speak properly.)
Gus Bew Until Eternity.

Are you kidding me?)
Gus Bew Until Eternity.

116
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,111
What now?

117
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,733
Then what?

118
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,080
He's all dressed.

119
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:48,104
(Voice: To see our beloved actor on stage)

120

(Voice: And for our fans)

121
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,311
Should I go out?

122
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,622
It has to be like that now.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,533
Go!

124
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:58,900
Please give a big cheer for Bew.

125
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,460
(Give us Gus and Bew already!)
Please give a big cheer for Bew.

126
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,160
(The stage is very small. My college
open house was grander.)
Please give a big cheer for Bew.

127
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,200
(Bew, my baby.)
Hello!

(I can smell baby powder from here.)

129
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,244
Where is Gus?

130
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,040
(#I'm his parent
and I'm here to pick up my kid.)
Where is Gus?

131
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,992
(Why is he alone?)
Where is Gus?

132
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,500
(Why is he alone?)
Here and Gus is right here.

133
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,180
(Will Gus be there?)
Here and Gus is right here.

134
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,866
(Is this his solo fan meeting?)
Here and Gus is right here.

135
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:14,580
A big round of applause for Gus.

136
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,420
(- But where is Gus?
- Gus!)
A big round of applause for Gus.

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,540
(they couldn't show up at the same time?)
A big round of applause for Gus.

138
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,933
A big round of applause for Gus.

139
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:17,193
(I thought you said he was next to Bew?)

140
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,193
(The organiser is very unprofessional.)
Goodluck!

141
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,080
(Maybe it's time to say
goodbye to your fame!)

142
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,180
(Go back to your hole! Hater!)
Where is Gus?

143
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,220
(“Goodluck”? What does it mean?)
Where is Gus?

144
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,580
(What are you doing? Is this a joke?)
Where is Gus?

145
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,780
(Why does he look nervous?)
Where is Gus?

146
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,100
(Something's not right.)
Where is Gus?

147
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,688
Where is Gus?

148
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:30,580
(They turned off the light.)

149
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,460
(Did he come? As a surprise?)

150
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,310
(But where's Gus?)

151
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,780
(Do you have manners? Why should Gus
be there when it's Bew's solo song?)

152
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,900
(He looks sad.)

153
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,555
(Let's cheer for Bew here.
Gus will be there when it's his turn.)

154
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:37,140
(- Bew's always the one who works hard.
- He worked the hardest in Mafia Baby 2.)

155
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,740
(Are you new here?
Gus is known for his tardiness.)

156
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,266
(I think Gus overslept.)

157
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,860
(Did he go out for drinks
last night or what?)

158
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,755
(Stop spreading fake news. Gus is religious.
He wouldn't do such a thing.)

159
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:44,540
(Bew looks sad.
Gus must have failed to show up!)

160
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,800
(It's an even for two.
I want to see the two of them together.)

161
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,620
(Where's Gus?)
"Do you have to."

162
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,580
(Now what are you going to do?)
"Do you have to."

163
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,177
"Do you have to."

164
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,300
"Do like this."

165
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,911
(He looks sad. Maybe it's genuine?)
"Do like this."

166
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:52,943
(He must be sad
because Gus didn't show up.)

167
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:55,220
(I feel sorry for him.)
"Pretend like you love."

168
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,560
"Pretend like you love."

169
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,620
"Is it fun."

170
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,406
(“Do you have to do this?“
I'm talking to you, the organiser!)
"Is it fun."

171
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,580
(He's trying hard to smile.)
"Or just satisfying."

172
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,022
"Or just satisfying."

173
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:05,200
Even temple fairs look better than this.
What's wrong with the organiser?

174
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,820
"What do you get by cheating on a person like me."

175
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,300
(I want to hug him.)
"What do you get by cheating on a person like me."

176
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,266
(Who made him sad? I feel bad for him.)
"What do you get by cheating on a person like me."

177
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,260
(They turned off the light again.)

178
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,140
(This is ridiculous.
The organiser is to blame.)

179
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,980
(The internet connection is bad.)

180
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
(Please don't hold any
events for them again!)

181
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,130
(- I heard footsteps.
- Someone's coming.)

182
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,340
(- Gus is here.
- He's coming.)

183
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,190
(- Bew is confused as is everyone.
- Oh my god.)

184
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,260
"Like a picture, that has always deceipt me."

185
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,540
(Give me a CPR. Gus is so handsome.)
"Like a picture, that has always deceipt me."

186
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
(He's so handsome I would
confuse him with a beautiful statue.)
"Like a picture, that has always deceipt me."

187
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,953
(My baby Gus. #Gus's Honey)

188
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:28,620
(Call a funeral home please. I think I'm dying.)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

189
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,660
"Happy Birthday to you!"

190
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,060
(- Gus and Bew Forever!
- Friends don't look at each other like this.)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

191
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,580
(- It's like he brought the cake to surprise his boyfriend.
- I wouldn't be surprised if there was a ring in the cake!)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

192
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:30,900
(- Happy Birthday, Bew!
- I wish you nothing but happiness, my baby.)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,300
(- Does this mean Gus is his present?)
- I love you as if you were my kid!)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

194
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,726
"Happy Birthday to you!"

195
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,020
(- Bew looks so happy it even shows in his eyes.
- Your smile lights up the world, Bew)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

196
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,080
"Happy Birthday to you!"

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,953
(- I love you so much!
- I wanna know what he wised for.)

198
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,740
(Told you there was
going to be a surprise.)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

199
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,540
(- Does this mean Bew can't live without Gus?
- Is the song from Y-Destiny?)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

200
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,660
(- Do they have to hold hands?
- I'm here to witness their love.)
"Happy Birthday to you!"

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,980
"And when I loved."

202
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,580
(-I'm dead.
- They're meant to be.)
"And when I loved."

203
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,577
(- Please, stay together for a very long time.
- Remember today, Gus. And don't leave Bew.)
"And when I loved."

204
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,340
"You stopped loving."

205
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,900
(I love you so much!)
"You stopped loving."

206
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,770
(I wanna know what he wised for.)

207
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,060
(Told you there was going to be a surprise.)
"You left me hurting that way."

208
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,288
(- Does this mean Bew can't live without Gus?
- Is the song from Y-Destiny?)
"You left me hurting that way."

209
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,020
(- Does this mean Bew can't live without Gus?
- Is the song from Y-Destiny?)

210
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
"Why did you do this."

211
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,911
(- Do they have to hold hands?
- I'm here to witness their love.)
"Why did you do this."

212
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:01,770
"Why so mean."

213
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,500
"You gave me hopes and then went away."

214
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,020
(I'm dead.)
"You gave me hopes and then went away."

215
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,780
(They're meant to be.)
"You gave me hopes and then went away."

216
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,644
(Please, stay together for a very long time.)
"You gave me hopes and then went away."

217
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:09,620
(Remember today, Gus. And don't leave Bew.)
"What for."

218
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,320
"What for."

219
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,666
The reason he was late was
because he was baking a cake for Bew.

220
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:14,377
You knew about this right?

221
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,777
Why dint you tell me anything.

222
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,600
If I told you.

223
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,955
Then you wont panic and Bew will find out.

224
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,733
Like this, its more real.

225
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,680
How's it when they are real, does it work?

226
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,340
Yeah! It works.

227
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,510
But next time, no surprises like this.

228
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,006
Toon, if there is a plan or anything.

229
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,200
Tell me too.

230
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,311
Sorry sis.

231
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:40,577
Next time I wont disappoint you

232
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,700
I will tell you everything. I promise.

233
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,860
(Thank you Gus for being my everyday reason to smile.)
Today thank you for everything, everyone.

234
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,160
(Gus, my love for you is as big as the world!)
Today thank you for everything, everyone.

235
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,780
(They've been through a lot
together. I wanna cry.)
We've seen all the love from the clip.

236
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,440
(My microwave baby.)
We've seen all the love from the clip.

237
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,220
(- Gus is the warmest person in the world.
- Help! I can't find tissue paper anywhere.)And see that you've been with us all along.

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,886
(Everyone deserves someone like you!)
And see that you've been with us all along.

239
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,155
(Don't me cry, please.)
Supporting us.

240
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:00,088
Encouraging us.

241
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,200
(- Of course, I would support you, my baby.
- He always turn to Bew when he doesn't know what to say.)
It's so touching. I have no words.

242
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,133
(Well, they're practically the same person.
They can speak for each other.)
Anyway.

243
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,511
(Maybe he doesn't talk much,
but his love is real.)

244
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,733
(Poor Bew. Gus always does this to him.)
I will let Bew say instead.

245
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:08,822
(#To Bew's guardians,
please stop attacking Gus.)

246
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:11,422
(Stop fighting! This is supposed
to be a touching moment.)

247
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:21,780
Me, being someone from the outskirts.

248
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,380
(Bew, you're my emotional support.)
Me, being someone from the outskirts.

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,940
(I thought about killing myself
because I had depression.)
Me, being someone from the outskirts.

250
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,606
(But it was your smile
that convinced me to live.)
Me, being someone from the outskirts.

251
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:24,460
(He's like me. I'm from the countryside, too.)

252
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,780
(Your efforts will never betray you, Bew.)
I never thought I would be famous.

253
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,740
(Bew, you're cute. You're down to earth.
Please, don't change.)
I never thought I would be famous.

254
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,577
(Take some rest if you're tired.
I'll always be here for you.)
I never thought I would be famous.

255
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,940
(His voice is cracking. I'm close to tears.)
And have so many responsibilities.

256
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,555
(It's only reasonable he feels this way)
And have so many responsibilities.

257
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,175
(because he rose to fame in a matter of days.)

258
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,860
Sometimes I think.

259
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,694
(Bew is working and studying
at the same time. He's so cool.)
Sometimes I think.

260
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,911
(Do you know he is a straight A student?)
I can't take it anymore.

261
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:35,197
(- Tell them, Bew. Haters, go away.
- You guys were criticizing the organizer just now!)
But when I see the love from everyone.

262
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,688
Being happy for me when I succeed.

263
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,711
Support me.

264
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,286
(- I'm a fanboy. Can you wipe at his tears?)
- Today's your day. Don't cry ma baby.)
When I make a mistake.

265
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,677
(Anyone here thinks it's scripted?
It's too emotional.)
I feel.

266
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,140
That I am very lucky.

267
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,933
(Of course, it's scripted. Everything is scripted.
Nothing is 100 percent the way you see it.)
That I am very lucky.

268
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:46,460
(Stop fighting you guys.
This is a moment to cry.)

269
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,100
(Give him some respect, please.)

270
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,580
(We're lucky to have you, too, Bew.)

271
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:47,866
(I know I stan the right person.)

272
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,340
(He's about to cry.)

273
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,940
(Don't cry.)

274
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,660
(I want to hug him.)

275
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,820
(Is there a tissue paper factory here?)

276
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,111
(It hurts to see him cry.)

277
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,180
(Gus, don't just stand there
and let him cry.)

278
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,266
(Is he crying because of all the things he said
or because Gus almost ruined the whole event?)

279
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,200
(Comfort him!)

280
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,340
(Gus doesn't want to intervene
because it's Bew's moment.)

281
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,140
(True, BL couples don't need to
act lovely dovey all the time.)

282
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,220
(Unlike a certain couple.)

283
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,866
(You hater! Don't start.)

284
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,040
(I feel sorry for him.
Seems he can't talk anymore.)

285
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,700
(Little Bew, don't cry.)
Another person I would like to thank is.

286
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,622
(Who is he going to thank now?)
Another person I would like to thank is.

287
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:13,377
(His voice is cracking.
Of course, he's thanking Gus.)

288
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:14,088
Gus.

289
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,940
(‘Thank you' is his way
of saying ‘I love you')

290
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,822
(That's not how
you look at your friend!)

291
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,840
Thank you for loving.

292
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,222
(It's raining so hard here in Bangrak.)
Taking care.

293
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,533
(It's raining so hard here in Bangrak.)
Supporting me always.

294
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,822
(Their hands! I saw what they did
with their hands!)
In the past 5 years we've known each other.

295
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,100
You are my best partner.

296
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,933
(Is this an fan meeting
or am I watching a TV show?)
You are my best partner.

297
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,100
(Is this an fan meeting
or am I watching a TV show?)

298
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,940
(fried chillies here. Order here
@fried chillies from Mae E Pring.)

299
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,933
(Gus, this is when
you kiss him on the cheek.)

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,260
(Don't give them ideas.
They're innocent.)
Let's keep being like this forever.

301
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,150
(They're not friends at this point.
Obviously, they're dating.)
Let's keep being like this forever.

302
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,930
(- What does partner mean here?
Like acting partner?
- Partner as in life partner?)

303
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,280
(I don't care if they're dating or not.
I'll continue to support them.)

304
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,622
(If this was a TV show,
this is when they should kiss.)

305
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,420
(They're so cute. I'll remember this
for a long long time.)

306
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,740
(Bew is so small.
I want to give him milk.)

307
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,700
(Little Bew looks very small here.)

308
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,540
(Now kiss him on his cheek.)

309
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,460
(Gus is so soft.)

310
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,377
(I knew he was going to do it.)

311
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:58,940
(He kissed him on his cheek.
That's not what friends do.)

312
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,380
(And this isn't sexual harassment?)

313
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,220
(They kiss each other all the time. Please,
don't comment if you don't know them.)

314
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,780
(It's not sexual harassment
when they're dating.)

315
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,540
(He was consented. Unlike
what a certain man did to his partner.)

316
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,177
(Bew looks so embarrassed
after that kiss.)

317
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,460
Oh wow! Is this a meeting or wedding.

318
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,540
(The host is at it again.)
Oh wow! Is this a meeting or wedding.

319
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,400
(She's so annoying.
Let them have their moment please.)
Oh wow! Is this a meeting or wedding.

320
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,260
("Is this a fan meeting or a wedding?"
Speak your truth, lady)

321
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,860
(What she said isn't wrong.)

322
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,540
(Tell the bride to say
something about the groom.)

323
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,300
(I love what the host did there.)

324
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,180
(BL fans are stupid. Anyone with a brain
knows this is staged.)

325
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,900
(She didn't have to say that.
Didn't she see how uncomfortable Bew is?)

326
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,570
(This looks forced. I don't like it.)

327
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:11,644
(You're bashing her for no reason.)
Ship or not ship.

328
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,320
(Yeah, I ship them!)
Ship.

329
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,644
(No, I don't ship them. Stop with the act.
Let them talk for themselves!)

330
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:15,860
(If I want to see them act, I can look up their TV show.
I want to see the real them here.)
Today, other than the surprise we have for all of you.

331
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,460
(There's another surprise?)
Today, other than the surprise we have for all of you.

332
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,220
(First, you made us wait.
And then Gus didn't show up.)
Today, other than the surprise we have for all of you.

333
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,822
(And then he showed up with the cake.
Do you still have more surprise?)
Today, other than the surprise we have for all of you.

334
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:22,740
(And then he showed up with the cake.
Do you still have more surprise?)
We have something else for our fans.

335
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,177
We have something else for our fans.

336
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:23,860
(Don't tell me...)
Which is the teaser.

337
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,340
(They'll announce they're dating?)
Which is the teaser.

338
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,900
(Oh my god. They'll finally reveal it?)
Which is the teaser.

339
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,353
(But we all know that
they don't have to announce it.)
Which is the teaser.

340
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:26,420
(True. If they reveal they have two kids together,
that'd be a real surprise.)
For our mini series.

341
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,080
(A new TV show?)
For our mini series.

342
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,820
(Oh my god. They're doing a new show.
Are they the leads?)
Smell of love.

343
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,622
(New show already?)
Smell of love.

344
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,180
(I dreamed and dreamed about this.
Despite the small odds.)
To watch together.

345
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,830
(A new TV show. This is exactly
what I'm waiting for.)
To watch together.

346
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:31,540
(Oh my god. There's a teaser already?)
First day, first place. Let's watch.

First day, first place. Let's watch.

349

(The teaser! I can't wait!)

350
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:36,420
(This is so exciting.
I can't wait to see it.)

351
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,220
(I want to them to play vampires.)

352
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,460
(Will they kiss in the show?)

353
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,780
(The title sounds
like a historical drama.)

354
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,910
(- Bew, you touched his waist.
Did you think we wouldn't see that?
- This is too good to be true. I think I'm dying.)

(Coming soon)

362

Yay, yay, yay. A big round
of applause for Gus and Bew.

363

(This looks interesting.)

(The first historical BL drama
in our country?)

365

(I hope the crew did some research.)

in China Town. Can't wait to see it.)
Are you all happy?

368
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,500
(Just because it's not different
doesn't mean it's going to succeed.)
Are you all happy?

369
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:53,460
Yes.

370

the royal-nationalist ideology on us.)Yes.

(Maybe this is staged?)

400
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,640
(These managers,
I think they want attention.)

401

Please come on stage. Yay.

402

Thank you for taking care of our babies.)

the fans are wearing!)
To thank both of you.

Same here. Same here.)
To thank both of you.

They look silly. LOL)

419
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,180
(Don't cry, Pla.)

420
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,980
(Pla looks strong on the outside, but
he is actually very sensitive.)

421
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,020
(I can't wait to hear what Bew has to say
about Toon. She's like his real mom.)

422
00:15:59,422 --> 00:15:59,900

I would like to thank Mommy Toon.

425
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:03,620
(Friendship this strong is rare.
Please treasure it.)
For adoring me and taking care of me.

426
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,533
For adoring me and taking care of me.

427
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:06,860
(Toon, please take care of Little Bew.)
Did you all know, me and mommy Toon.

428
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,733
(Please, look after Bew for us.)
Did you all know, me and mommy Toon.

429
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,540
(Pla has a funny face.)
We never made a contract.

430
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,340
(Don't bully him, please.)
We never made a contract.

431
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,760
(That was unexpected.)
It's all heart and trust.

432
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,680
Because I love and trust her the most.

433
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,957
(“never signed a contract”)
Without needing a paper contract.

434
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,466
(So, they're together because
they trust each other.)
I want all of yout to
lover her like I do because...

435
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,444
(This is very touching.
There's no contract needed.)
I've never seen her as a manager.

436
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,000
(But it's risky. What if she stole from you?)
But I see her as another mother.

437
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,140
(Toon, please don't
do him dirty for money.)

438
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,288
(They seem so close. I can't bear to think
what would happen if they part ways.)

439
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:31,820
(Is this scripted?)

440
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,653
(Who wrote it for him? That was
a good speech, but sadly it was fake.)

441
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:33,846
(I love them so much.)
Isn't that cute?

442
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:34,760
(Bew is lucky to have Toon
as his manager.)

443
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
Yes.

444
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,511
Alright. That's enough.

445
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,460
(But still, a contract is needed.)

446
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,370
(A lot of couples broke up
because of their managers.)

447
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:39,400
Last song.

448
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:41,140
We would like to dedicate this song to.

449
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,833
(You were bashing the organiser
when the fan meeting started)
We would like to dedicate this song to.

450
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,569
(and now you're enjoying the event?)
To the people we love.

451
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,260
Our mothers and our fanclub.

452
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,688
(This is why we shouldn't
jump to conclusion.)
Our mothers and our fanclub.

453
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:46,700
That's right.

454
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,650
(Please stay together
for a very long time.)
That's right.

455
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:50,580
Everyone, another round for both our mothers.

456
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,488
(Please be together
until the end of time.)
Everyone, another round for both our mothers.

457
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:52,820
(Please be together
until the end of time.)

458
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
(Pla and Toon are linking arms.)

459
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,420
(I love this couple. And their managers
are best friends as well.

460
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,220
(Hopefully, they won't fight over
petty things in the future.)

461
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,300
(But of course, managers don't
stay friends long.)

462
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,020
(#GusBewUntilEternity
is treading at no.2.)

463
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,620
(Thank you for the fan meeting.)

464
00:16:57,622 --> 00:16:58,600
(Voice: You must be wondering!)

465
00:16:59,111 --> 00:16:59,580
(Voice: How is there war when there is so much love)

466
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,980
(It started off very confusingly
but ended with tears.)
(Voice: How is there war when there is so much love)

467
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,020
(Give them a round of applause.)
(Voice: How is there war when there is so much love)

468
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,088
(You guys did a very good job!)

469
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,422
(Voice: The title is Managers War)

470
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,480
(Voice: So the story should start from there)

471
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,547
Hello.

472
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,827
The box is so cute.

473
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,980
Behind people are waiting. Come on.

474
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,955
Go on, go on!

475
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,822
- Go on.
- Behind are waiting.

476
00:17:58,866 --> 00:17:59,840
Come on.

477
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:11,120
Oh, oh, oh.

478
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,577
This is great.

479
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,866
Look at that.

480
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,177
It was good we introduced them.

481
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:19,040
Look how close they've become.

482
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:22,844
Fanclubs also supporting them.

483
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:24,333
- You.
- Hmm.

484
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,444
Want them to support more?

485
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,400
What do you mean?

486
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,444
Oh, you mean that?

487
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,333
I don't know.

488
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:37,711
It's too risky.

489
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:39,866
I know it is.

490
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,066
But in present.

491
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,888
No risk no fame.

492
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,177
Move on.

493
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:00,380
Thank you, go on.

494
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,777
Walk on.

495
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,622
Acting class at 8am?

496
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,244
Will I be able to wake up

497
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,288
I have to stay up all night to complete a project.

498
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,755
You have to be able to.

499
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,733
Kru Vivian cleared schedule just for you.

500
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,470
Fight. Fighting.

501
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:25,488
Umm.

502
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,177
Do it!
So your work comes out great.

503
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:31,555
It's good your room is close by.

504
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,377
I have to drive back to Rangsit.

505
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:36,133
Tomorrow I have to come for acting class around here as well, I am not even complaining.

506
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,222
But its too early.

507
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,088
Let's do this?

508
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,866
You can stay over at Bew's room.

509
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:46,044
His room is close to Kru Vivian's school.

510
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:47,888
And you both are close.

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,800
You also don't have to wake up too early tomorrow.

512
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:50,955
And no need to drive far.

513
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:52,111
And Bew.

514
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,155
You will have someone to help you with the model.

515
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:54,977
Good?

516
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,822
- That's good.
- Umm.

517
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,866
- Go, go go.
- Sis.

518
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:01,488
They are close.

519
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,466
But Bew needs some privacy too.

520
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:08,777
I dont know. I am just suggesting.
Up to you.

521
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:12,755
Lets go keep things in the car while they talk.

522
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,600
- Do I take all these stuff?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

523
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:17,911
Umm.

524
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:20,533
Huh.

525
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:29,240
Let's go.

526
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:36,472
What Gus.

527
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,222
Why are you carrying me?

528
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:44,422
Done.

529
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:47,570
Lets go shower.

530
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:50,377
Lets shower.

531
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,866
Shower!

532
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,911
Crazy.

533
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:00,066
Or...

534
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,488
You want to shower with me, Bew?

535
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,088
Little one.

536
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,111
P' Gus.

537
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,000
There is no FC here, don't speak like that

538
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:09,955
I get goosebumps.

539
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:39,222
What box is this?

540
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,666
Hey, p' Gus.

541
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,050
Its nothing.

542
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:46,977
Then why are you hiding it.

543
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:49,311
Nothing.

544
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,155
A box of porn cds?

545
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,244
No.

546
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:08,488
You go shower.

547
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,911
And go to sleep after that,
I've got some work to do.

548
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,088
Dont worry, I can wait.

549
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,488
I will still be awake when you come in.

550
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:19,600
No need. I will sleep on the sofa outside.

551
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,870
You are the owner of this room
so you should sleep on the bed.

552
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,422
Ow.

553
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,000
You are the guest.

554
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:26,377
You sleep on the bed.

555
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:27,844
I will sleep on the bed.

556
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,955
If you sleep with me.

557
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:30,066
The End.

558
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:32,470
P' Gus.

559
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:34,666
What the heck are you saying.

560
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,911
Go shower.

561
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:37,600
Go.

562
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm borrowing your shirt.

563
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:44,860
Yeah.

564
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,430
Will I be able to sleep like this?

565
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,890
What are you doing on the floor?

566
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:14,022
Meditating!

567
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:20,088
I have back ache.

568
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,822
Then who told you to come sleep with me on the sofa.

569
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,266
Lets go shower.

570
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,000
If I get late, mom will scold.

571
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,444
Take off the shirt for me.

572
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,044
Quick.

573
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:49,980
P' Gus.

574
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:51,866
Why arent you wearing any undies?

575
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,022
Why arent you.

576
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,644
P' Gus.

577
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:58,693
Oye.

578
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:13,500
Kiss.

579
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:15,644
Yes.

580
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,644
Dont act surprised

581
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:20,244
I already sent you the script yesterday.

582
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:22,577
Nevermind

583
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:23,933
I know.

584
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:27,244
That's why I invited Kru Vivian here today.

585
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,644
Hello.

586
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:33,822
Don't worry.

587
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,266
If you can do this,

588
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,466
You might even get to play in a new series Bew.

589
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,022
Being an actor.

590
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,200
You need to be able to act in all roles.

591
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:42,130
Umm.

592
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,088
Actually you dont have to play all the roles.

593
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,555
No. Honestly!

594
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,466
How can you be able to play all the roles.

595
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:55,244
But you should never limit your talent.

596
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:56,511
Until you try it first.

597
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:57,333
Right?

598
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:58,088
So.

599
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:00,044
Lets try an exercise today.

600
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:03,740
And if you feel you cant take it.
We can...

601
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:05,555
Find a solution later.

602
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:06,990
Okay, teacher.

603
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,155
Okay.

604
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:09,911
Okay.

605
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,810
Fighting.

606
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,888
Okay.

607
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,911
Lets sit and hold hands.

608
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,577
And close your eyes.

609
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,711
Okay.

610
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,610
Relax.

611
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,422
If you feel relaxed.

612
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,377
I want you think of.

613
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,266
A sound.

614
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,244
Sound of the time.

615
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:43,313
When you spend it with someone you love.

616
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:46,955
If you can hear the sound clearly,

617
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,711
And you feel you are present there.

618
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,066
Next, I want you to imagine the smell.

619
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,444
The smell you get.

620
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,200
When you are close to that person.

621
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,444
We will start.

622
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,955
To see them in the imagination.

623
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,600
Is he trying to say something to you?

624
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,622
If you can see clearly.

625
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,244
Do you have anything you want to say to him.

626
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,834
Thank you for loving.

627
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,644
Taking care and supporting me.

628
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,213
Let's stay like this forever.

629
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,770
I dont know how lucky I am to have you.

630
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,066
Bew, Bew.

631
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:24,133
If the person in your imagination.

632
00:28:25,644 --> 00:28:27,800
Is present here in front of you.

633
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:31,488
Is the person holding your hand right now.

634
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:35,377
Is breathing with you right now.

635
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,111
What else.

636
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,022
Do you want to do with them.

637
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,866
Other than telling you love them.

638
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:49,520
Yayy.

639
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:50,677
Good job.

640
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:52,780
Amazing.

641
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,111
Gus.

642
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,311
You.

643
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:13,860
- Stuff these socks into your pants.
- No.

644
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:14,891
Quick.

645
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,140
Or should I stuff it for you.

646
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:17,044
Quick.

647
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,955
Stuff it in.

648
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,866
Toon, look at this.

649
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,488
The clip of the workshop.

650
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,133
Here.

651
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:31,888
They are cheering them to be a real couple.

652
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,022
(They're doing rehearsal for Smell of Love)
At first they will cheer
but if they announce they are real,

653
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:38,055
(They're doing rehearsal for Smell of Love)
But if they announce they are real.

654
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,866
(They're doing rehearsal for Smell of Love)
Everyone will stop shipping, stop watching.

655
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,222
(Why do they need to rehearse when they do that
all the time when they together?)
Our couple.

656
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,340
(I don't think they need the rehearsal.)
I want them to be brothers but act real.

657
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,711
(They'll kiss in the show.
Call me an ambulance.)
I want them to be brothers but act real.

658
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,230
Thats already good, right?

659
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:48,333
Right?

660
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,844
Okay.

661
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,444
But its really good.

662
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,377
Let me see.

663
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:02,666
Oh!

664
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:05,511
When we shoot. You can do a real kiss.

665
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,866
Finish it with one take.

666
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:09,844
I was planning to do that.

667
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,488
As if I want to kiss you many times.

668
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:12,800
Ahemm.

669
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:15,111
But during the workshop,
you cant stop kissing.

670
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:18,666
The teacher is really good.

671
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,240
He created the mood for the kiss.

672
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:21,955
In real, you're so agitating.

673
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:23,800
No, you are more annoying.

674
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,288
But during the workshop.

675
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,088
Who were you thinking about.

676
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,111
I wasn't.

677
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:33,622
Just…

678
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:34,777
You just kissed me like.

679
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,466
Like...

680
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,444
You dint imagine anyone?

681
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:39,466
Umm.

682
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:42,533
No one in specific.

683
00:31:43,044 --> 00:31:43,880
I just believed.

684
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:45,622
That I really loved the person in front of me.

685
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:47,511
And kissed him. That's it.

686
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:50,555
Thats good.

687
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,444
I thought.

688
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,933
You were thinking of me.

689
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:04,844
Not thinking anything?

690
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:16,688
And.

691
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,311
Action.

692
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:15,933
That was good.

693
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,422
I thought.

694
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:18,822
You were thinking of me.

695
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:22,780
Oye.

696
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,755
Huh!

697
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:30,444
Break!

698
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:36,666
Huh!

699
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,311
Whats happening, why cant you play.

700
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,111
This is too many takes already.

701
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,777
It's getting late too.

702
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:51,367
Can I have a moment.

703
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:54,977
Oye, break!

704
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,466
Eat something.

705
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,466
Whats wrong with you guys.

706
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,177
You were doing so well during the rehearsal.

707
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,155
Why cant you.

708
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:07,177
There are a lot of people on the set.

709
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,088
Its normal to be shy.

710
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,844
What is there to be shy about?

711
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,155
Its just acting isnt it.

712
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,511
Do you want me to remove. Yes, remove.

713
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:15,777
Do you want me to also go act instead?

714
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,044
Oye.

715
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:18,000
I

716
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,311
Am sorry.

717
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,288
Please give me a moment.

718
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:33,274
Bew.

719
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,355
If I am the reason you cant play.

720
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:38,311
If it is because of the thing I said just now.

721
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:41,311
I am sorry.

722
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,000
Why are you sorry.

723
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,155
I am just excited.

724
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:51,022
I am not thinking of anything. Really!

725
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:56,711
Give it your best.

726
00:34:58,355 --> 00:34:59,120
I can differentiate.

727
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:20,377
Kru Vi.

728
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:23,577
Can I get some advice.

729
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,511
About acting.

730
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,200
Calm down first.

731
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,422
Tell me, what is it.

732
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:49,488
What I did earlier

733
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,622
I am starting.

734
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:52,311
To feel it for real.

735
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:54,866
Hmm.

736
00:35:58,755 --> 00:35:59,355
It's.

737
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:00,967
I think.

738
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,488
To be an actor.

739
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:06,088
You need to be sensitive.

740
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,177
Its normal if.

741
00:36:08,222 --> 00:36:11,688
If can feel the spark with your partner.

742
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,155
But.

743
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,880
I am scared, Kru.

744
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
He says he can differentiate.

745
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,133
But.

746
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,688
Let me give you some tip.

747
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:24,644
Bew.

748
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,466
Try to do it for your role.

749
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:28,600
Do it for the character first.

750
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:32,155
Once its done.

751
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:35,288
And you can still feel that
those feelings are becoming real.

752
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:37,022
We can find a solution.

753
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:38,022
Hows that?

754
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,577
That's the problem.

755
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:43,622
The feelings are real.

756
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,022
When you asked.

757
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,311
To think about someone I love.

758
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,600
I saw Gus's face.

759
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,760
Even though I wasn't actually thinking of him.

760
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,067
(Super hot! Too hot!)

761
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,560
How come you played so well just now.

762
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,022
You even went out of script.

763
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:19,822
Last night I rehearsed with Gus.

764
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:20,911
So I was able to play.

765
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,111
Did anything else happen?

766
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:54,622
Hmm.

767
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,286
Its going to spill all over the room.

768
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,155
Just take for the feel.

769
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:03,438
The character has to be drunk.

770
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,066
Do you have to do this much.

771
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,650
Just this much then.

772
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:51,711
Come on. Lets rehearse.

773
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:53,732
Tomorrow is the last queue.

774
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,177
If you can do it

775
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,559
I will take you to eat salmon.

776
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,133
Do you want to sit upstairs.

777
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,600
Nevermind, here is fine.

778
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,311
Come sit here, so we can be close.

779
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:10,266
Nevermind.

780
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,622
Come up.

781
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:14,452
Quick.

782
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:15,649
Hey

783
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,266
Gus.

784
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,612
What is this.

785
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:25,978
Have first.

786
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:42,155
So bitter.

787
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:51,933
Where have you read until?

788
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:53,888
Here.

789
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,933
Apin.

790
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,266
Do you want me to take you home.

791
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,355
Oh mister.

792
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,044
With what position do I go stay with you.

793
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,288
People will talk.

794
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,244
That the gold shop owner.

795
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,866
Brings in a low caste person to his house.

796
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,177
If you speak bad about yourself again.

797
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,444
I will not tolerate.

798
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,022
And where?

799
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,244
You have never actually done anything.

800
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,355
Mister.

801
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:37,512
Have you now?

802
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:38,565
Yes.

803
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:40,386
Oye.

804
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:43,552
Umm.

805
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:44,832
You give in so easily.

806
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,945
(Speaking Chinese)

807
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,399
(Speaking Chinese)

808
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:50,605
(Speaking Chinese)

809
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,810
You are important to me too.

810
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:05,688
If one day.

811
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,044
The world allows us to love each other.

812
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,592
Stay with each other.

813
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,644
Without hinding, that would be good.

814
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,600
Apin.

815
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,622
If you just come see me.

816
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,355
Tell me you love me.

817
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,152
You don't have to come often.

818
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,155
Or no need to let the world know.

819
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:00,650
You just come.

820
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,555
Good boy.

821
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:17,192
Good mouth.

822
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:26,399
But not just the mouth.

823
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,111
Cut.

824
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,822
Good, very good.

825
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,288
Really very good.

826
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:12,777
Oh!

827
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:14,710
Really good.

828
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,333
Just now.

829
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,577
It was breath taking, right?

830
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,400
Good.

831
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:26,452
Slowly get up.

832
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,039
Really good job.

833
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:32,439
Come on.

834
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:34,735
That was excellent.

835
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:35,966
Can I get a towel.

836
00:43:37,152 --> 00:43:38,152
Thanks.

837
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:40,532
Wrap yourself.

838
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,232
Then come here.

839
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,644
How come you played to well just now.

840
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:51,592
Even out of script.

841
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,699
I rehearsed with Gus last night.

842
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,990
So I was able to play.

843
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,377
Really!

844
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,355
And did anything else happen.

845
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,599
Nothing mom.

846
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,177
Wasn't that good that I was able to act.

847
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,377
Bew.

848
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:42,866
Lets go shower

849
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:45,400
I'll be back.

850
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,177
There was really nothing?

851
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,022
That was quite hot.

852
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,179
Okay, welcome everyone to.

853
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,511
The Wow Jai Y show.

854
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,844
If anyone is a shipper.

855
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:19,300
Then this is the ship to look out for.

856
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,177
The new really hot and upcoming ship

857
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:25,770
Gus and Bew.

858
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:30,730
Say hi to your fans.

859
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:33,286
Hi.

860
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,839
Hello to you too.

861
00:45:34,863 --> 00:45:36,592
So cute.

862
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:37,832
We see that you

863
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,422
Gus, you like to make dessert.

864
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,177
For Bew to eat often.

865
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,111
- Yes.
- Really! Can you tell us more.

866
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:44,688
It's

867
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,450
I like to bake for Bew.

868
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:49,074
Because it feels like taking care of someone.

869
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:51,219
Its like mixing the ingridients together.

870
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:52,870
Gently putting together.

871
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:54,185
And bake.

872
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:56,099
At the right temperature.

873
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:58,230
Oh! How do you give them warmth.

874
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,022
How do you bake?

875
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:02,290
He means cake. Okay.

876
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:05,855
Okay. What about you.
Heard that you like to make something hot and spicy.

877
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,006
For Gus to eat.

878
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,801
- Yes.
- What is it?

879
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:10,452
I make papaya salad for Gus.

880
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:12,727
But he doesn't like papaya salad. Ow.

881
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:14,919
But I only know how to make that.

882
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:18,103
So you force him to have it.

883
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:20,445
Yes, but I must praise this show.

884
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,686
- You do such good homework.
- How?

885
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:25,446
That you dint bring dry shrimp
because Gus has allergies to them.

886
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,266
Cant have at all.

887
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,088
What symptoms do you have?

888
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:29,052
Rashes.

889
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:30,166
Rashes on the skin.

890
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,511
But do you have rashes in your heart too?

891
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,579
Fiesty

892
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,088
Gus, have you ever tried Bew's spicy papaya salad?

893
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:42,600
Yes I have.

894
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:43,876
- Bew's coooking.
- Yes I have.

895
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,644
It's delicious.

896
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,822
Was it spicy?

897
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,200
Not spicy.

898
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:49,230
Bew is sweet.

899
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,955
Wait, you mean sweet face?

900
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,246
Cant, cant do this.

901
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,800
You cant do this on live show.

902
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,733
How do you like, sweet or spicy?

903
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:11,511
I like cute.

904
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,333
Caring.

905
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,710
Have confidence.

906
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,488
How about physique, tiny?

907
00:47:18,622 --> 00:47:20,822
Yes, they're easy to take around.

908
00:47:21,242 --> 00:47:23,339
Next time, no need tiny.

909
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:25,452
Or caring or anything.

910
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:26,477
Just say Bew.

911
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,600
We are talking about specs and girls.

912
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:32,310
He's shy. No need to be shy

913
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,555
I only said this
Dont think too far.

914
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,644
Bew.

915
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,866
Bew.

916
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,111
Bew.

917
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,155
You.

918
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:40,506
Right?

919
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,222
Yes.

920
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,333
You shy?

921
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,511
Oh.

922
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:44,666
Yes.

923
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,452
He just got shocked.

924
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:48,131
So cute. See everyone.

925
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,651
Here's to this couple

926
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:51,938
Gus and Bew.

927
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:52,606
They will make your heart go.

928
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:55,359
Wow Jai Y.

929
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:01,959
I was going as per script.

930
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,733
You cant be annoyed like this on camera Bew.

931
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,133
If mom knows about this.

932
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,416
What will you do.

933
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,819
I am confused.

934
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:15,755
What.

935
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,400
Is going on between us?

936
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:22,022
Stop.

937
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:25,560
I thought you know.

938
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,133
How would I know.

939
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,644
You never made it clear.

940
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:33,900
When I want to talk, you act busy.

941
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,955
If its a mistake because of being drunk,
you can tell me directly.

942
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,133
No.

943
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,400
(Voice: Gus, are you ready?)

944
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:51,155
(Voice: We will be late for the closing party)

945
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,326
Thank you.

946
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,511
Bew.

947
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:28,258
We have been together 4 to 5 years now.

948
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,688
I can feel it.

949
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,977
That you are not blurred.

950
00:49:35,244 --> 00:49:36,422
From lack of sleep.

951
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:38,473
You look tensed.

952
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:40,965
Look.

953
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,800
Your fingers are chewed off.

954
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,486
You dint even drink the hot chocolate I got.

955
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,244
Bew.

956
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:56,565
Do you remember when you said.

957
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:58,857
That I am like your second mom.

958
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:01,785
Yes I do.

959
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,263
Do you still feel the same way.

960
00:50:09,892 --> 00:50:10,892
Then.

961
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:12,666
If you have anything.

962
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,120
You can talk to me.

963
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,615
Promise me.

964
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,733
You wont be angry?

965
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:26,725
I promise.

966
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:55,266
Sis.

967
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:57,222
I thought we spoke about this

968
00:50:57,285 --> 00:50:58,325
I am not in this with you.

969
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:00,078
What?

970
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,311
What are you saying. I am confused.

971
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:02,688
Oye.

972
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,355
You should get an oscar.

973
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:05,844
Stop acting.

974
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,644
You asked Gus to intoxicate Bew.

975
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,911
To make him think that Gus like him.

976
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:12,732
And wants them to be real.

977
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:13,706
Like that?

978
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:15,226
Creating publicity?

979
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,133
Oh wow Toon.

980
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,088
Calm down.

981
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,000
Do you watch a lot of tv drama.

982
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,088
I am going to tell you what.

983
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,292
What is the guarantee?

984
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,911
That if they become real,
they will be more popular.

985
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,111
You told me that if there is no risk,
then there is no fame.

986
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,533
Toon, calm down.

987
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,977
Why don't you think.

988
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,533
That Gus could actually like Bew.

989
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,311
Like. Like what?

990
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,166
Gus likes women.

991
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:03,239
(Have no one beside but still open
because love has no gender!)

992
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,992
You want us to act like a couple.

993
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:08,199
But still saying that we are brothers?

994
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,044
It's like a scene over a scene.

995
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:12,800
It's called placement.

996
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,622
Hey, Bew.

997
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,666
Why are you not at the closing party today.

998
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Let's go.

999
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:58,404
The Wow Jai Y.

1000
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,888
Is trending number 1.

1001
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,733
FC are saying that.

1002
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,444
We are real couple.

1003
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,200
How can I be stupid not to see.

1004
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:10,155
That you were faking with me.

1005
00:53:11,711 --> 00:53:13,933
If you like women then why give me hopes.

1006
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,000
Bew.

1007
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,800
Calm down.

1008
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,044
I am so stupid.

1009
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:20,806
To think that you would love me.

1010
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:23,050
In reality, you are just.

1011
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,293
Just hungry for publicity.

1012
00:53:26,844 --> 00:53:28,400
You just want to get famous right?

1013
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,933
I am starting to get angry now.

1014
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,422
Angry? I should be angry.

1015
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,306
Stop hitting yourself and stop scolding me and listen.

1016
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,819
You heard the conversation between the moms.

1017
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:45,355
You dint finish listening to it right?

1018
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:49,150
If you heard till the end.

1019
00:53:50,612 --> 00:53:52,052
You would've known that I was there.

1020
00:53:56,622 --> 00:53:57,888
I just told moms.

1021
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,090
That I love you.

1022
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,155
When doing workshop with Teacher Vi

1023
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:10,688
I saw only you.

1024
00:54:22,153 --> 00:54:23,413
You are an actor.

1025
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,763
You should know whats real and whats fake.

1026
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,765
For the past 4 to 5 years.

1027
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:39,766
You think I've been acting all along?

1028
00:54:42,972 --> 00:54:43,972
You think

1029
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,479
I was faking with you?

1030
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,955
Im...

1031
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,800
I am sorry.

1032
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,200
I dont know what happened.

1033
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,800
I am confused.

1034
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:12,500
I dont know.

1035
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,733
What you feel about me.

1036
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:28,555
How many times have I told you.

1037
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:30,377
Not to do this.

1038
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,822
Talk to me the same way.

1039
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:35,459
I am not used to it.

1040
00:55:38,423 --> 00:55:39,543
Then you better get used to.

1041
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,688
I will never use bad language with the person I love.

1042
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,333
What?

1043
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,333
Umm.

1044
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:04,240
Not angry anymore?

1045
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,660
Not angry anymore?

1046
00:56:07,316 --> 00:56:08,316
Hmm.

1047
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:11,957
Oye.

1048
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:13,189
Stop!

1049
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:23,311
Gus.

1050
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:25,355
What next?

1051
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,166
Will Pla and Toon agree?

1052
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,777
I told you Toon.

1053
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,377
They really love each other.

1054
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,888
Sis.

1055
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,180
This is not Y novel selling romance.

1056
00:56:52,688 --> 00:56:54,377
How can they be a couple.

1057
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,422
You also know.

1058
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,888
People say something else but do something else.

1059
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,355
Then what do you want me to do.

1060
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,911
Break them up?

1061
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,600
They love each other.

1062
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:03,813
Ahemm.

1063
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,266
You speak as if Y couples dont have something behind.

1064
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,311
I thought you were going to tell us to
Keep telling people we're just brothers.

1065
00:57:10,444 --> 00:57:11,688
Can you act like that.

1066
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:13,777
Did you watch Wow Jai y.

1067
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:15,893
Like...

1068
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,933
You want us to act like a couple.

1069
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,866
But say that we're just brothers?

1070
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,120
Its like acting on acting.

1071
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,840
Its not a series.

1072
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,888
Take it as a lesson.

1073
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,711
Its called placement.

1074
00:57:32,174 --> 00:57:33,733
Knowing what the FC want.

1075
00:57:33,806 --> 00:57:36,400
And placing yourself accordingly.

1076
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:38,993
We've always sold the innocent brothers card.

1077
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,155
But its not innocent anymore, Toon.

1078
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,377
You.

1079
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:45,281
No risk.

1080
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,044
No fame.

1081
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,000
They're so cute.

1082
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,222
- Sis.
- Hmm.

1083
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,844
Should we start doing that project.

1084
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:32,444
Sounds good. They are in spotlight.

1085
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,222
Toon.

1086
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,355
I am looking for an organizer.

1087
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,422
Who do I take.

1088
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:39,155
Which one are you looking at.

1089
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,044
This one?

1090
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,372
(KK IG' account)

1091
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,977
I think they are too big
and too expensive

1092
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:49,293
I will find someone and let you know.

1093
00:58:51,392 --> 00:58:52,552
What are you looking for?

1094
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:55,906
Nothing.

1095
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:57,187
Just talking about work.

1096
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:07,420
(Smell of Love )

1097
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,286

1098

1101
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,850
(Is this scripted or self written)

1102
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:40,803
(Sweet both on series and real life)(Exposed #They're in a relationship)
(Gus Bew lives in the same house)(Told you, people can make out)

1103

(I promise to act surprised when you are offcial)(Cheer BL but dont ask for Equal marriage, wait!?)

1104
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:49,173
Hello everyone.

1105
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:50,880
Welcome to the show.

1106
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,020
"Fun Gossips."

1107
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,466
With me Priang Prang.

1108
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,060
The hot MC, as always.

1109
00:59:58,091 --> 00:59:59,073
Today.

1110
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:01,826
We have a special guest.

1111
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,333
The actors from series Y.

1112
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,511
That is having very good trends.

1113
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,450
At the moment.

1114
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,800
Its none other than

1115
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:10,688
Gus and Bew.

1116
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:12,420
Clap.

1117
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,733
Hello!

1118
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:19,040
How are you both?

1119
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,200
We are good

1120
01:00:20,222 --> 01:00:21,577
I want to ask something

1121
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:23,622
I saw that there are moments.

1122
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:26,200
Moments on social media.

1123
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,311
What happened there? Gus, you first.

1124
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,755
- Moments on social medias right?
- Yes.

1125
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,488
There not a lot of moments.

1126
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,244
Because how we are behind cameras,
we are the same on camera.

1127
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,306
I want to ask more.

1128
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:43,659
Are you planning something these days.

1129
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,066
Can you tell me.

1130
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,044
- Planning something?
- Yes.

1131
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:48,253
We've got nothing.

1132
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,844
We've never had anything.

1133
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,377
Really

1134
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,288
I mean concert.

1135
01:00:54,888 --> 01:00:56,911
I want you to promote it.

1136
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,911
Oh.

1137
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:59,570
Yes, thats coming soon.

1138
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,244
We are soon going to have a concert

1139
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,633
Gus Bew Light Live.

1140
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,560
Please staye tuned.

1141
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:10,120
Light Live.

1142
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,400
So interesting.

1143
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,911
Let's talk about the speciality of this concert.

1144
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,066
How is it.

1145
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:18,357
You can say that.

1146
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,733
No one has ever seen Gus dance and sing like this before.

1147
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:27,266
Thank you.

1148
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,190
Sis.

1149
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:33,386
Huh.

1150
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,488
Hey.

1151
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:39,622
Who did this.

1152
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,044
What do you want.

1153
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:57,133
Why did you do this?

1154
01:01:57,873 --> 01:01:58,873
Nothing

1155
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,160
I am scared that if you get famous.

1156
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,800
You will forget that, you stole Bew from me.

1157
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,593
Does Bew know.

1158
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:10,000
That I asked you to bring him to me.

1159
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,355
Oye, sis.

1160
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,444
That was a long time ago.

1161
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:14,602
What do you want?

1162
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,466
Or jealous?

1163
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,755
You should take this time to take care of your children.

1164
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,311
Don't let it happen like with Punn.

1165
01:02:22,444 --> 01:02:23,133
Yeah.

1166
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:24,839
Goodluck to you.

1167
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,755
Beware of Pla.

1168
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:28,800
If he can betray one person.

1169
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:31,222
He can do that to you too.

1170
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,555
Crazy.

1171
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,393
She wanted us to have a fight.

1172
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:41,799
If anything, you share everything with me right?

1173
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,393
When Teacher Vi asked me to think of someone I love.

1174
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,733
I saw Gus's face.

1175
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,977
Without intention.

1176
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:00,977
Make it happen tonight.

1177
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,500
Sis.

1178
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,600
Anything I need to know?

1179
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,133
Oye.

1180
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,044
Sis

1181
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,333
I tell you everything. My sis.

1182
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,511
Calm your mind.

1183
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,511
Let's go back to see the kids.

1184
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:26,986
Last question.

1185
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,555
Actually I dont want to ask

1186
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:30,911
I dont want to know at all.

1187
01:03:30,955 --> 01:03:32,570
But I am forced to.

1188
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:36,022
Are you guys.

1189
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,888
A real couple.

1190
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:41,400
But pretending to be a ship.

1191
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:43,072
Yes or No?

1192
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,844
We are real.

1193
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:49,246
I mean.

1194
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,288
We are really a shipping couple.

1195
01:03:55,726 --> 01:03:57,446
Need to wait and watch.

1196
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:59,667
And this is Gus and Bew.

1197
01:03:59,692 --> 01:04:01,360
A round of applause again please.

1198
01:04:04,222 --> 01:04:06,350
(Voice: The name is "Managers War")

1199
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,310
(Voice: The story needs to start from managers)

1200
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:22,586
(Gus Bew announces concert, FC asks for the official dating announcement)

1201
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,733
(Next Week)
Tadaa.

1202
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,266
New menu from Mos Burger.

1203
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:29,066
How many events did I turn down
so your child can go for his exams

1204
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:30,380
Gus has seafood allergies.

1205
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,333
He can't eat it anyway

1206
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,266
Gus, what's wrong
