(- It’s showtime.
- I’m so excited.)

(#I’m your Star, P) (Show me Nott, please.) (What’s the event?)
But the grandness is still so grand Seoulsay.

17
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,375
(The hosts talk too much.)
That's right and the award

18
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,910
that everyone has been waiting for.

19

When name got called there will be screams.
I have no idea who's winning.

Let's take a look of our nominee this year.

(Are you kidding?) (Stop exaggerating!) (#MafiaBaby was truly a success.) (I don’t know who I want to win.) (Can they both win this?)
And next P Atichon.

(My baby, P) (Oh my.)
Congratulations! Congratulations!

36
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:46,750

- Well, I’m not surprised.)

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,750
(- The show is too old.
- #I’m Your Star, P)

38

(I like all the nominees so far.)

40

CONGRATULATIONS!

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,866
(- It’s rigged.
- Dew looks happier than P.)

51
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:36,918
(P is the best.)

52
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:39,083
(#I’m your minion, Nott. I’m happy for P’s fans.) (Pan should’ve won. No offense.)
So excited today, Seoulsay.

53
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,999
(To you who said it was rigged, are you sure you want a lawsuit?) (Will there be a group shot?)
So happy for you!

54
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,083
(- Oh, I want to be there so much.
- His performance was better and yet he lost?)

55

(LMAO)
The floor is yours, P.

56
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:45,910
(Cry if you don’t agree
with the result. I don’t care.)

57
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,415
(- I love him.
- Well, he has good support.)

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,622
(- Legend.
- I cried.)

59
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,620
(P’s fans, don’t forget
to trend the hashtag.)

60
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,244
First of all P would like to thank THE GREATEST Y award.

61
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,133
That Y GALAXY gave to P too.

62
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm very honored.

63
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:13,751
I would like to give a portion of this award

64
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,155
to LOVE TRICK Real Love Engineer the Series,

65
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,160
together created a legend of Thai Y series.

66
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:26,626
Thank you, Dew.

67
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:29,330
Although he's a big channel actor now,

68
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,790
he's always be my comfort zone.

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,977
And thanks to the new gen of actors.

70
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,533
I understand that this award's a goal of many.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,167
But don't try for it.

72
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,167
Because I...

73
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,459
want everyone to try for themselves

74
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,830
and to develop Thai Y series industry.

75
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,533
Then one day,

76
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,292
this award will go to you.
I support you.

77
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:17,542
Thank you.

78
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,950
That's a very good speech, Seoulsay.

79
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:27,200
Alright, that was the 11th Grand Award.

80
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,580
It's perfect for the winner.

81
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,410
I agree, I'm very happy for you.

82

87
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,876
(Is the award show over?) (Who did you meet there?) (I saw you, Bew.)
Did you all watch Y GALAXY?
The event is big right?

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,250
Did you saw me? Please screen shot for me.

89
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:38,999
Bew must enter the contest!

90
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:43,250
If I got named, promise to vote for me?

91
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,822
(Nott. For work, please contact Candy.
Pan. For work, please contact Koon.)

92
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:21,417
Have you been waiting for long?
I did my best to rush out.

93
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,709
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,700
Not that long. You don't really have to rush out.

95
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,167
No, I have to. You are waiting for us.

96
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:36,160
No biggie. Just want to congratulate the winner.

97
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,459
I'm happy for you!

98
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,876
Thank you!

99
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,709
And don't forget to reward him too.

100
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,080
Don't worry, I already know how.

101
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,209
Well, we have presents for you.

102
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,542
All from Nott's Minions and Pan's Mummi.

103
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:52,751
Thank you.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,626
Let's take a photo.

105
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,834
Is this all the things I told you?

106
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:08,626
Well, the fans transferred in lots of support money.

107
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,410
More than expected so I bought more stuff.

108
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,955
Next time call me first.

109
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,022
Don't buy these much.

110
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:21,626
You don't even know what he uses or not.
It's a waste of money.

111
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,830
Tell me first next time.

112
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,990
Yes, mam.

113
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,751
It's okay P'Koon.

114
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:30,777
I can use everything.

115
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,950
Thank you all very much for everything.

116
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,750
And I really like all the things I got.

117
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:42,311
Hello.

118
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:45,375
(What happened?)
Please.

119
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:46,688
(- I want to see them being sweet to each other.
- Now, I’m confused.)

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,125
(- Why did these people show up?
- I’m sick of entrepreneurs.)

121
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,584
(They always intrude.)
This camera. This camera.

122
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:52,709
(They’ve never been allies. They only care about LGBTQ now because they want their products to sell.)
Thank you.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,167
(Anyone, care to tell me what they sell? I want to avoid it.) (This is embarrassing.)
Thank you very much. Thank you.

124
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,334
Let's take a pic.

125
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,292
(- He’s adorable. People love him.
- Thank you for loving our man.)

126
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:28,999
(This makes my heart warm.)
Thank you.

127
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,466
(I want to see Nott and Pan.)

128
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,167
(Tell me their product names, please. I’m dying to spend some money.)
(Everyone, don’t forget to trend the hashtag for the award show.)
(Show me Nott and Pan.)

129
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,334
(Stop telling them who to show. You didn’t fund the award.) (Please love and support our P.)
P!

130
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,042
Hey, P'Gift.

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,125
(- Wait.
- Are you telling me…)

132
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:37,792
(Her again?)
How are you?

133
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,584
(The infamous wheelchair girl.)

134
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:39,417
(She’s still around?)
Is your leg better?

135
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:40,918
(How many years has she been wearing that cast?)
So much better.

136
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:41,876
(Our boy is too precious.)

137
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:44,751
(She’s literally in every fandom.)
Can I write something on it?

138
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,500
(She raced her wheelchair for an actor the
other day. I was lucky I didn’t get hit.)

139
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,292
(My precious baby.)
Yes.

140
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,311
(- She can walk. I saw it.
- She must’ve done a lot of good deeds in her past life.)

141
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:57,111
(Dew. For work,
please contact Boom.)

142
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,375
Congratulations on winning THE GREATEST Y.

143
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:07,542
Thank you, Dew.

144
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,752
(- He only knows how to show him love.
- Don’t go too far.)

145
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:22,815
(Can I be honest about this?)

146
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,235
(What an attention seeker!
Does he feed on people’s attention?)

147
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,600
(- He went red all over his face.
- This is what I live for.)

148
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,244
(- They don't know manners.
- There is nothing wrong about it.)

149
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,044
(Do they want all screen time to themselves?)

150
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,466
(They can’t stand
when other people get attention.)

151
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:33,333
(P and Dew are the cutest.)

152
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:38,584
Sis, I will have to bring Pan and Nott back.

153
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:39,918
(Again?) (She’s always in a hurry.)
But they just came out.

154
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,626
(She only cares for us
when she wants us to vote.)

155
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:42,792
(The one in light blue. I think I’m falling in love with him.) (#Do A Proper Job, Lady Manager) (He looks good in black.)
We just met them.

156
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,167
(His name is Pan. He was in Mafia Baby.
He won Outstanding Leading Actor.)

157
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:47,918
(Give Pan lots and lots of love.) (I’m tired of them. Show me the remaining couples.) (He won’t let go of his hand.) (Someone is being overprotective.) (Will there be a season 2?)(What’s this event?) (I want my baby to get some rest.) (Look after your baby, Nott)
P'Koon, can I stay with them for ten minutes?

158
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,417
Ten minutes?

159
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:50,999
Yes.

160
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:31,751
See how long it took to get home?

161
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:33,792
What time is it?

162
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:35,667
Why don't you look at the time?

163
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,751
I asked the fans. I touched my chin.
Why didn't you notice?

164
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:47,542
If you're gonna be like this,
don't fucking set secret code.

165
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,834
I thought you were having fun with the fans.
I didn't think you wanted to go back this much.

166
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,667
What fun? I'm tired to death.

167
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,417
Take a look.

168
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,083
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,125
Pan, I'm happy for you.

170
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,918
Oh, a lot of stuff as usual.

171
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:15,042
Please take pictures for me, I'll post for the fans.

172
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,626
Alright, I'll take cute photo for you.

173
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,334
Set up things for a moment.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,334
123.

175
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,834
Keep going, keep pressing, keep going.

176
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,584
Pose. Cheese pose. Cutie pose.

177
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,542
OK.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,125
Can I see?

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,876
How did you do this?

180
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,918
Why all the fans paid a lot for you.

181
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,709
How did you do it?

182
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,834
Well, first, you have to eat lots of vegetables

183
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:10,500
and brush teeth. Brush before bed.

184
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,626
And more importantly,

185
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,083
you must not interfere
with other people's business.

186
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,751
This is really important, Fang.

187
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:28,584
Pan, I told you many times already

188
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:33,083
that you don't call Pharaoh Fang.
Call him Pharaoh.

189
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,626
His stage name.

190
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you. P'Song take something.
I already picked the things I liked.

191
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:54,500
OK.

192
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,600
(- #I’m Your Star, P.
- #P and Dew)

193
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,377
(#Pan, Nott’s baby)

194
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:54,777
(This award isn’t for me.
It’s for everyone.)

195
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,150
(Let the photo speak for itself.)

196
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,150
(I honestly don’t know
how to repay your kindness.)

197
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,150
(I promise I’ll work hard
and make you all proud of me.)

198
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,150
(I love you all so much.)

199
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,150
(How could I not love you when you’re this cute?)

200
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
(His cuteness is too much
for my heart to handle.)

201
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,177
(He wrote it with his own hand.
That’s ten times sweeter!)

202
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,660
(I’m glad I’m your fan, my baby.)

203
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,822
(He puts 100 percent into everything,
whether it’s a job or for his fans.)

204
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,000
(Handwriting beats typing.)

205
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,125
Is there too many NC Khun Pipat?

206
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,125
I think it's normal when the characters grow up,
the story got more intense.

207
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,292
And customers want them.

208
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,709
Who wants to make season 2 lighter than the last?

209
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:13,917
Uh, P' Pat? P'Dy asked me to ask you about the money.

210
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:19,334
Tell Candy that it's the season
I already gave you more.

211
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,500
Or if you have a number, write it in the contract.

212
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:25,083
OK.

213
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:32,959
Or if it's not convenient to you.
You don't have play nude scenes.

214
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,167
Because this season we have a new partner.

215
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,876
I can let the new couple play those scene.

216
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,667
I'm all ok, it's up to P'Koon.

217
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,375
If she's ok, I'm ok.

218
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,042
OK.

219
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:49,790
Okay.

220
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:51,667
OK.

221
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,660
(Mafia Baby.
This mafia boss has a little secret.)

222
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,777
(Tidnuer can't succeed his dad as
the next mafia boss unless he marries.)

223
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,577
(See you in season 2.)

224
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:07,600
(- It was good. I didn’t want it to end.
- I was sad when it ended.)

225
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,105
(- The best show of the year already.
- Pan was good. He will win an award.)

226
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,085
(- The show made me forget I was sad.
- Thanks for making Monday interesting.)

227
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,251
(I recommended the show to
my friends and they all loved it.)

228
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:13,977
(The production was top-notch.
Worth every second of my time.)

229
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,600
(- But they ended with just a kiss?
- I thought it was going to be sexier.)

230
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:19,195
(- Will there be sex scenes in season 2?
- The show needs sex scenes.)

231
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,915
(Some hot sex scenes
for season 2, please.)

232
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,235
(Hot sex scenes.)

233
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,955
(Hottest Sex Spence of 2019.)

234
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:58,288
(Hottest Sex Spence of the Year
goes to Love Trick.)

235
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:01,999
Is that right?

236
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:04,959
I can't help you.

237
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,250
You got yourself in trouble.

238
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
(Are you free?)

239
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,300
(Come out and meet up)

240
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,600
(Are you free? Come out and meet up)

241
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,918
Don't you feel anything?

242
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,542
(Next Break)
About the love scene?

243
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,334
It's just sex.

244
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,730
So is this sex or acting?

245
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:02,600
(War of Y)

246
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:09,933
(War of Y)

247
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,750
So slow.

248
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,120
But when I wank, can't say I'm slow.

249
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,333
I have to clear myself.

250
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,749
I can't just standby for you all the time.

251
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:42,290
Clear up.

252
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:45,000
I believe now you're really busy.

253
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,088
Got sucked?

254
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,749
Got more than got sucked.

255
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,910
Really, don't you feel anything?

256
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:01,959
What about?

257
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,209
About what Pat said.

258
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:06,501
Oh.

259
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:10,626
Love scene?

260
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:14,292
It's just sex.

261
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,167
Not sex,

262
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:19,844
it's acting.

263
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:38,530
(The same room.)

264
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,970
(The same room.
- And?)

265
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:53,755
(Elizabeth Hotel)

266
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,044
So is this sex or acting?

267
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:52,584
Workshop.

268
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,000
Oops!

269
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,540
Why did you take it?

270
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,250
You, delete it!

271
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:11,250
If I delete it,
what will I watch when I miss you.

272
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,959
Is this busy business you told me about?

273
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:07,790
It's just...

274
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,330
temporary business.

275
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:18,792
It's not as busy as the next story.

276
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:37,555
(Where are you?)

277
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:23,044
(- Where are you?
- In the workshop room.)

278
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:46,584
I have to tell you honestly
that I'm very happy.

279
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,377
I'm really glad that
there are new actors for me to do makeup on.

280
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:54,042
To put do make up for the old actors

281
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,042
is so boring.
I can't do it with my eyes closed.

282
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:02,501
I can see that Bew have very good skin.

283
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,733
You took a very good care of yourself.
Not like some actors.

284
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,288
Don't party too hard or
your face will be ruin like the moon.

285
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,875
And I will have to put cement
to cover your face.

286
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:18,542
Talking about this gives me headache.
Let me put on some hairpin.

287
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,042
Bew, listen up if you took a good care of yourself,

288
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:27,250
it will help other people work easier too.

289
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,334
Yes, mama.

290
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:31,370
Where did Gibsy Baby go?
She's not taking care of the outfit.

291
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:33,250
Gone on maternity leave?

292
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:41,000
P' Mod, is there a launching party today?

293
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:45,125
Well, a party, yes, but not ours.

294
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:48,917
- The actors have arrived.
- Oh (scream).

295
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,792
- Hey, Auntie.
- Hello.

296
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,666
Haven't seen you for a long time.
You're more beautiful.

297
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,022
Are you flirting with old people?

298
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:06,042
Ahem. My throat is dry.
Have you prepared mineral water?

299
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:11,417
A glass bottle of mineral water for you.
Auntie remembers.

300
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,709
Thank you, auntie.

301
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,711
Hi, P'Pla.

302
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:19,167
Hi.

303
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:20,209
Hello.

304
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:20,917
Hello.

305
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,584
Hi.

306
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:24,700
Hello. Hi. Hi.

307
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,288
- Mod. Is the air conditioning room ready?
- Yes.

308
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:32,750
Last time I fucked up, but not this time.

309
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,511
Please come this way.

310
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,733
If you do, I can show you the contract.

311
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,250
Oh, you don't have to. No need at all.

312
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:40,870
Please.

313
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:46,376
One more.

314
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,292
Hello.

315
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,917
The ice is done right?

316
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:04,584
Yes, tube ice like how you like it.

317
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:05,870
Thank you.

318
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:27,750
New actor?

319
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,644
Yes, but they're sub pair.

320
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,250
Room with air conditioning, please come in.

321
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,410
- Handsome!
- Yes?

322
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,133
I can't have them, they're Pan's.
If you want to have them, go over there.

323
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,790
- Go, go, go. I will prep it for you.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:45,290
Thank you.

325
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:51,800
(For Pan)

326
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:59,242
Okay, fighting. Concentrate.
Do your best, understand?

327
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,750
Fighting!

328
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,792
- I'll be behind the camera.
- OK.

329
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:14,084
Ah, everyone's ready?
Lights? Cam?

330
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:16,660
Actors? Concentrate.

331
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,875
3..2..1. Action!

332
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,290
Mr. Tim, run away!

333
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:31,792
Cut! Just relax! That wasn't right at all.

334
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:35,334
Well, let's try relax and go easy.
It's a bit stiff now.

335
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:41,749
Let's try again. 3..2..1. Action!

336
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,459
Mr. Tim, run away!

337
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:54,167
Keep rolling. Wait, still tense and not relaxed.

338
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,933
The audience have to cheer on if
you could play or not. No!

339
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,870
Try this method. Recite prayers in your mind.

340
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,000
Breathe in, breathe out.

341
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,330
Let's do it together.

342
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's try it.

343
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:10,709
OK.

344
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:20,501
Breathe in, breathe out. Should be better.

345
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:24,376
Try one more time.
I hope it will get better.

346
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,488
Yah? Come on.

347
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,668
Ah, let's try again. I hope it gets better.

348
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:35,125
3..2..1. Action!

349
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:38,959
Mr. Tim, run away!

350
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,666
Cut! Okay, I'll go inside for a moment.

351
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:50,668
Oi.

352
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,733
What?

353
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:56,417
Ha!

354
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:00,222
Thank you.

355
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,555
You have to go at five o'clock.

356
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:10,500
Uh, can we do 7?

357
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:15,290
Your queue is actually till nine.

358
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,266
Help me me help you.

359
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:22,417
Hey, I didn't ask

360
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
but inform you to go at 5.

361
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:32,750
Yes.

362
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:47,200
(I’m writing this to confirm
our appointment at six p.m.)

363
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:47,875
Action!

364
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,250
(Next Break)
I want hot kiss!

365
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,577
Hmm, isn't that a bit too hot?

366
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,733
I want this take to be the last.

367
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,222
(War of Y)

368
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:09,533
(War of Y)

369
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:15,910
Let's try again. I'm rooting for you.

370
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:21,910
A total star have arrived?

371
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,500
So have the scene to yourself.

372
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,251
Just shoot the next scene now.

373
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,450
And then day for night.

374
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,330
Please?

375
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:36,120
And 50% star will have to wait.

376
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,160
- Please.
- Yes.

377
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:38,667
Go.

378
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:39,959
Change scene.

379
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,334
What? Whaa?

380
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:44,917
How? Who? What?

381
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:56,370
How?

382
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:57,955
What?

383
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,834
Ah come here.

384
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:17,000
This scene is going to be hard.
A bit tiring.

385
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:20,875
Action scene and now love scene?

386
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,542
It started with Nuer involving with the stunt.

387
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:28,292
And when the stunt fell over
you pull him to kiss.

388
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,334
Ah like this.

389
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,750
But I will see a passionate kiss.

390
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:37,042
- Passionate sucking!!!
- Suck it to the climax.

391
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,126
We will start from.

392
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:40,292
Nuer walks in for a kiss.

393
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,625
Oh like this and then

394
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,126
pull him in and

395
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:49,120
kiss and turn to the left
then kiss and turn to the right.

396
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:52,120
It's so drinkable this one is for sure.

397
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,042
Uh wait.

398
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,542
Isn't it a bit harsh?

399
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,502
A bit harsh? It's not harsh.

400
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:03,830
Yea? I'll make it beautiful and artistic.

401
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,376
Look at the light and the place.

402
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,040
This scene it will go viral.

403
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:15,120
If so I'd like space for him to meditate first.

404
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,292
He's not be used to this kind of scene.

405
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:22,500
Sure.

406
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,080
The rest can take five.

407
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:28,126
Let the cast stay here and meditate.

408
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:28,870
Please.

409
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:29,620
Yes?

410
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:30,583
Yes.

411
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:32,160
Okay.

412
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,620
You can all reset.

413
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:36,620
Remake his face too.

414
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:38,790
Yes Candy.

415
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,499
Do it together.

416
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:41,625
Yes.

417
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,042
OK the actor ready?

418
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:56,376
Yes!

419
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:56,959
Yes!

420
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:03,875
321.. Action!

421
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:06,834
Cut.

422
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,709
Ah let me check.

423
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:13,875
Pass!

424
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,792
Great job.

425
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,490
Pass within one.

426
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:23,167
Even thought you're not used to this scene.

427
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,418
So hot.

428
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:31,418
Are you tired?

429
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:32,251
I'm fine Candy.

430
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,499
Awesome.

431
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,875
We can go now.

432
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,251
I think..

433
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:45,490
I want another take.

434
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:49,660
I feel like the table just looked too hot.

435
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah it's a bit off the character.

436
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:54,700
I want it to look like you're new to it.

437
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,750
Did you say you want boyfriend feels?

438
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:03,540
Innocent boyfriend feels.

439
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,167
It's complicated.

440
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:07,834
It's like.. You get it right?

441
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:09,251
Yes? Yes?

442
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:10,042
And Nott.

443
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:13,910
I want to add more fuckboi to than it.

444
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,334
Now it's too low. Make it up to this level.

445
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,418
Too little. Add them up fucker boi.

446
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,084
And when you're together

447
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,750
try to bending a bit.

448
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,917
So he will look higher.
The audience will love it.

449
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:28,625
For the happy shippers.

450
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,500
OK.

451
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:32,251
- Let's go! - OK?
- Sir!

452
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:35,620
Then I want this take to be the last.

453
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:37,250
OK?

454
00:43:38,444 --> 00:43:40,910
Yes.

455
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:45,120
Start this scene with no fighting and

456
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:46,200
just start kissing.

457
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,580
OK?

458
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:49,490
OK. Reset.

459
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,120
Reset the make up.

460
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,450
Is the set ready?

461
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:02,875
- Yes. - Yes.
- OK.

462
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:07,209
Okay. All ready.

463
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:12,209
Three two one. Action!

464
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:35,042
P' Bird I've heard that last scene just hit?

465
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:36,660
It's fine.

466
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,490
I shot it and I still got goosebumps.

467
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,251
That huge?

468
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,875
This is P'Koon's level.

469
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,418
She's a lot.

470
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,292
Maybe she wants to protect her kid?

471
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,792
Her kid is really good.

472
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,251
He can do anything you told him to.

473
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,459
Never waste time. So it's okay she's bossy.

474
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,000
It's beyond.

475
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:59,209
So you also think like us?

476
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:03,000
P'Koon is very annoying.

477
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:05,583
Hey I didn't think that.
Just stating the fact.

478
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:06,583
Crazy.

479
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,500
Ha! So it's true.

480
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,330
This means that you think like me right?

481
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:16,667
Sis

482
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,292
long time no see.

483
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:23,200
I was busy so I didn't come to say hi.

484
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,120
Oh.

485
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:27,620
How are you doing?

486
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:32,120
- Good.
- I didn't know you still taking care of Bew.

487
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,580
Didn't see your face.

488
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:36,950
At first I was very sorry to lose Bew.

489
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:39,910
Pouched.

490
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,959
But now I don't regret it

491
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,917
because it's afternoon.

492
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,709
Nong Pan has many more scenes.

493
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:53,870
Yes.

494
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,040
See you later.

495
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:07,330
Bew, hurry up and eat.

496
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:09,167
We have to read a the play.

497
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,540
This time we have to do great.

498
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,120
Do you understand?

499
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:13,410
Yes.

500
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:15,290
Eat quickly so we can read.

501
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,040
Pan, let's go.

502
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,266
Khun Koon, the car has arrived.

503
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,870
Oh, ok.

504
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,134
Wheewhee and, uh, who else is going?

505
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,500
- Is it Giftsy?
- Oh, yes, Giftsy.

506
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:39,334
Help me prepare

507
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,583
because I will give you a touch up.

508
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:45,160
Hair, face and lips.

509
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:46,625
I have an appointment with a customer.

510
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:48,583
Help me a bit.

511
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:50,700
OK.

512
00:46:51,022 --> 00:46:52,040
Help me please.

513
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:52,376
Yes.

514
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:53,459
OK. Let's go.

515
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,209
P'Pan?

516
00:46:55,555 --> 00:46:57,540
Can we take a photo with you?

517
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,500
Sure.

518
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:01,418
Please allow me..

519
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:09,540
P'Mod can you please take a pic?

520
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:11,040
Ok.

521
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,459
Wait.

522
00:47:16,244 --> 00:47:17,750
Smile. Smile~.

523
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,542
Another pic.

524
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:22,625
Ok, very beautiful.

525
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,209
Mod?

526
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:23,750
Hmm?

527
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,834
That's enough, he's a new actor.

528
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,126
He has to prepare a lot more.

529
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:28,700
OK.

530
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:32,410
You better go.

531
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,709
Oh, go, go, go.

532
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:37,709
Fighting!

533
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,290
Pan, darling?

534
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:55,250
Alright, don't spray too much.

535
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,660
The alcohol with stuck on it.

536
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,126
I'm bored.

537
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:02,410
Did you tell him that I will go too.

538
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:03,500
Yes.

539
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,167
Khun Chalerm is the main sponsor of TTV.

540
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,822
If we get to know him and pamper him a little bit,

541
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,450
he might be able to help us.

542
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:14,830
Then come back no later than eight o'clock.

543
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:17,540
Otherwise no go.

544
00:48:19,888 --> 00:48:20,533
OK.

545
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:22,250
Eight o'clock is Eight o'clock.

546
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:30,700
Take care of him.

547
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,084
Yes.

548
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,292
I'm going to clear out my face first.

549
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,244
(Gus: Please look forward to Mafia Baby Season 2.)

550
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,333
(They look like siblings who rival each other.)

551
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,410
(Next Break)
How long have you been waiting?

552
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,250
Don't forget to talk about presenter contract too.

553
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:23,400
Khun Chalerm hello.

554
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:24,618
Hello Khun Koon.

555
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,284
Hello.

556
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:26,867
How long have you been waiting?

557
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:27,742
Not that long.

558
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,783
I like to be ahead of time.

559
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:31,867
Are you tired today?

560
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,466
Bew has already rested on the car.

561
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,066
Sit first.

562
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,444
Thank you.

563
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:40,159
Khun Koon, sit.

564
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:46,860
Hello again Sir.

565
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:56,740
Pan has a much better skin in person
than on TV.

566
00:49:57,555 --> 00:49:59,320
Yes, he takes good care of himself.

567
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:03,200
Used up three bottles of your Pure Skin.

568
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:04,110
Is this true?

569
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:05,451
Yes.

570
00:50:05,992 --> 00:50:08,075
Is it yours?

571
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,333
I never knew.

572
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,555
I really like the smell of the lotion.

573
00:50:14,075 --> 00:50:15,117
Good. Good.

574
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,244
This month new scent will be out.

575
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:19,618
I'll send to you.

576
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:21,409
Thank you very much.

577
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:22,159
Send to you too.

578
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,000
Thank you.

579
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,555
So today, fire away.

580
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,488
I rent this room so the shop has to close.

581
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,000
Eat as much as you can.

582
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,284
Go on.

583
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,644
I can only be here until 8.

584
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:39,933
What?

585
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,488
We agreed to 10, didn't we?

586
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:44,950
Yes, but...

587
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,284
I'm sorry.

588
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,600
This month, I'm often be working.

589
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,600
The doctor told me to take extra care.

590
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:57,367
Sleep early for clear face on camera.

591
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,400
Oh, I understand.

592
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,555
So is this your secret

593
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,088
to have such good skin?

594
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:10,955
Just eat as much as you can then.

595
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,355
Your skin will be firm on camera.

596
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:15,659
Thank you.

597
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,488
Nong Pan,

598
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,244
Be here. I have to pick up the phone.

599
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:28,867
I have to take this call.

600
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:29,700
OK.

601
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,022
You try this one?

602
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,755
The ice cream here tastes really good.

603
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:49,000
Have a taste.

604
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:49,711
Yes.

605
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:55,155
Here this is better.

606
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,933
Ahh..

607
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,044
Oops.

608
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,200
All messy.

609
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,055
Why don't you try it?

610
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,800
I haven't eaten here in a long time.

611
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,030
Eat more.

612
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:29,711
OK.

613
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,355
Have you eaten yet?

614
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,977
I'm full.

615
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:54,117
Full right?

616
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:54,699
I'm full.

617
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,688
Let's call it a day.

618
00:52:58,783 --> 00:52:59,075
Yes.

619
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,266
He can take a rest.

620
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:07,450
And don't forget to come back to talk about

621
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:09,690
presenter contract,

622
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,155
Yes, I won't forget. Thank you.

623
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:16,034
Thank you very much for today.

624
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,044
It's okay, it's okay.

625
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:21,950
Yes, sir.

626
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:24,700
Thank you.

627
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:10,422
(Karlart, my secret to fragrant cheeks.
Kiss my cheek if you want proof.)

628
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:12,420
(- I can’t find the perfume anywhere.
- You're asking Dew to kiss your cheek?)

629
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,155
(Apparently, I have a certain scent.
What do you think I smell like?)

630
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:35,922
(- My heart is weak.
- You smell of baby powder, Pan.)

631
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,466
(You smell of cotton candy.)

632
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:39,460
(Nott, tell him what he smells like.)

633
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:41,077
(- Pan smells nice. I can vouch for it.
- I could smell him from a distance.)

634
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,044
(You’re melting my heart.)

635
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,170
(Any skincare product would like to
offer my baby a deal? He smells nice.)

636
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,170
(I can smell baby powder from the photo.
- Can you tell him what he smells like?)

637
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,466
(Did you fight for our country in your
past life to have such good body odour?)

638
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,200
(I know what he smells like
but I’m not sharing it with you guys.)

639
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:11,400
(I know what he smells like
but I’m not sharing it with you guys.)

640
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,355
(- Nott, You’re so daddy.
- You know how to tease your man.)

641
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:13,222
(How do you expect me to sleep now
after saying such thing?)

642
00:56:13,222 --> 00:56:15,220
(- I think I’m dying.
- Now I can’t wait for season 2.)

643
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,220
(What are you doing to my heart, Nott?)

644
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:20,880
(Trending in Thailand)

645
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,815
(#Dew #Pan, Nott’s baby)

646
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,155
(Nott send you a photo.)

647
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:43,288
(- Take turns smelling each other?
- You’re all talk.)

648
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,155
(Apparently, I have a certain scent.
What do you think I smell like?)

649
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:42,000
(This is why you can only be a BL actor.)

650
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:46,075
This is a big deal.

651
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:48,284
(Next Week)
Aren't you going to do anything?

652
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,355
Are you satisfied?

653
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,244
Or want me to do something else?

654
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:55,699
People are gossiping that
a couple breaking up badly

655
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,844
because of the love scene on the set.

656
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,866
Nott hasn't liked Pan for 2 posts.

657
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,377
So people will think it's them.

658
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,355
I ask you for real now.

659
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,911
Why are you servicing,
pleasing the fans this much?

660
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:07,783
Everything that I do

661
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,177
it's all me.

662
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,000
What service are you talking about?
