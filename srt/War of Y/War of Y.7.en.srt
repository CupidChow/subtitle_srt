We will have different locations
Surroundings.

132
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,740
And then the stage.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Placement, standing, various sitting points.

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680

139
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Excuse me.

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Sis.

141
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:51,960
Oh sorry.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
That's right, I wanted to add something.

143
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
It's.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Gus's songs
I want it to be a a little more fun.

145
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
The songs are too slow.

146
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay, okay, okay.

147
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,880
Take note of it.

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,440
Should we do this?

149
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,480
For the slow song Bew can sing.

150
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,440
Because he sings slow songs really well.

151
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Sure.

152
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,360
We will leave this up to you.

153
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:23,240
Sure.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Can?

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
Thank you.

156
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:40,446
Alright.

157
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,188
Action.

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Go.

159
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Ok. Cut.

160
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,288
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

161
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,038
Are you okay?

162
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Yo.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,440
Well.

164
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,720
I think when Gus stretches up and down
It looks weird, doesn't it?

165
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,040
How about alternating this?

166
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,840
Let Gus ride Bew's back.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
That might work.

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,560
Hey.

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,640
This is good.

170
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Interesting, interesting.

171
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
So let's try it.

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,040
Ah, change.

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,320
Lets do this

174
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
Gus will ride Bew's back.

175
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Um.

176
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
You okay?

177
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes Okay.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Okay?

179
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Action.

180
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Bew.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How are you Bew?

182
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Are you okay?

183
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,240
Take a break, break
Can you get up?

184
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Gus.

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Why dint you continue?

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Why didn't you wake me up?

187
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
No need to shoot anymore
We got the photos.

188
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Moms are checking the clips.

189
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Rest up.

190
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Today was hectic for you
Its okay if you got sick.

191
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Everyone understands.

192
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Understand?

193
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Um.

194
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:17,920
If mother Toon understood me.

195
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,080
Would she force me to shoot.

196
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,280
Even if I wasnt well.

197
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Seriously.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
If it was possible.

199
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,800
She wouldve woken me up for the shooting.

200
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,293
No.

201
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
Im not so sure anymore, Gus.

202
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
The word.

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,720
To take the opportunity.

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
That mother Toon often talks about.

205
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,881
It means that I have to
Take advantage of the opportunity.

206
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,880
Or Toon wants to make money.

207
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Why do you say that?

208
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Toon, loves you.

209
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,640
She cares for you.

210
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,560
She has been stressed all day.

211
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
This isn't very nice.

212
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Im just being silly.

213
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
I just wants to hear.

214
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Are you tired?

215
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
Are you okay?

216
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Take a break?

217
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
Just like before.

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,680
It's a lot of work these days.

219
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Moms are trying to do their best.

220
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,040
If you want them to understand us.

221
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,280
We also need to understand them too.

222
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,600
Im not feeling good sis.

223
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
About?

224
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
About Hombre.

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,120
Think its a little too much.

226
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm scared he wont be able to do.

227
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Umm.

228
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Honestly, Im scared he will fall sick too.

229
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,120
So?

230
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,560
Should I call K.Gap?

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,620
Hmm.

232
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,089
What the hell.

233
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,240
I thought I'd be scolded.

234
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
No.

235
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
Why should I scold.

236
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,600
I'm a manager.

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,160
Not a dictator.

238
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,255
Go.

239
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
Go take care of your child.

240
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
Before he gets disappointed.

241
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,163
Go.

242
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Thank you sis.

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Thank you sis.

244
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,821
Umm.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,720
(Khun Noon (Hombre's CEO))

246
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Hello K. Noon.

247
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Yes.

248
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Phi Pla.

250
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,040
Bew hasn't arrived yet?
I can't find him anywhere.

251
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah.

252
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Me too.

253
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Toon is also not picking up her phone.

254
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
It's been an hour late.

255
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,320
How will we get to practice.

256
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Welcome back to Bew's live.

257
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
It's already noon

258
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,200
I know that everyone is definitely hungry now
So today I have.

259
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,800
Something delicious to share with you all.

260
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:43,646
(What are you presenting?)
Tada.

261
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,796
(My Little Bew is here now.)
New menu

262
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:45,800
(#Bew'sMother is here to pick him up.)
from Boss Burger.

263
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:46,989
(He's here with a shrimp burger.)
Big sweet, crispy.

264
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,477
(Individual work? Why is he doing this?)
and bouncy shrimp.

265
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
(Is Gus not with you, dear?)
With special sauce.

266
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:50,613
(This is Bew's live. Don't ask about others.)
Perfectly delicious.

267
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:51,582
(Here we go.
They're starting to work separately)

268
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,760
Want to eat?

269
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
Can I eat? Can I eat it already?

270
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,840
Let me feed you guys first.

271
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
Mmmm.

272
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's eat together.

273
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Toon.

274
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
How dare you do this.

275
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,016
How dare you get a shrimp burger
And slap me and Gus in the face?

276
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Sis

277
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
Gus is allergic to shrimp.

278
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
He cant eat it anyway.

279
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
The client wont pick him.

280
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,840
How many jobs have I not accpeted
So your child can take his exams.

281
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,056
And I never thought of accepting
a solo job for Gus.

282
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Sis.

283
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,880
K. Gap told me everything.

284
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,240
The day of the live
You were sweet talking to K. Noon.

285
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Right?

286
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Huh.

287
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,280
K. Gap is the agency.

288
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
But you handed your business card to K. Noon.

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
What were you thinking?

290
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,760
I was scared the job would be off.

291
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
You and your son were so hesitant.

292
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,520
I had to contact Khun Noon first.

293
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,840
Really?

294
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,240
And who said that he was worried Bew
That Bew would knock.

295
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Bla bla bla.

296
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Were you just faking.

297
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,800
Sis, damn.

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,800
You are just like what P' Koon said.

299
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,280
Here I come back and apologize to you.

300
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,480
But after hearing this, I am speechless.

301
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
You dont have to say anything.

302
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,960
And don't betray me again.

303
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,920
Because if next time there is another one.

304
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,320
I wont be this nice.

305
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Toon.

306
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Someday.

307
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,160
You and I have to separate to go separate anyway.

308
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
You know it.

309
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Y couples dont last forever.

310

(BewBew's Going SOLO)

You are still the same.

How you were at school
You are still like that.

Im the same?

316
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,960
If Gus cant dance.

317
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,640
Why doesnt he go behind in the background.

318
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,840

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,440
Sigh.

348
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Do you have a cigarette.

349
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Thanks man.

350
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
You're still the same.

351
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,035
How you were at school.

352
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,246
You are still the same now.

353
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Same?

354
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,067
I look so shabby.

355
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
But you.

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Since you got famous.

357
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,240
You look a lot more handsome.

358
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Why so handsome.

359
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
I have to thank you.

360
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,356
For inviting to cast with P' Pla.

361
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
What.

362
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
It's because of your skills.

363
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:10,770
Your acting was good.

364
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,696
That's why you got in.

365
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
You're not angry with me, are you?

366
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,803
That I got that job.

367
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:26,213
Crazy.

368
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:27,903
I was younger back then.

369
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,015
Well.

370
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,316
It's stupid of me to whine at you like that.

371
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
In fact.

372
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,656
P' Pla chose you.

373
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
It's not your fault here.

374
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Yes!

375
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,570
Im relieved.

376
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,096
I thought you were.

377
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Still angry with me.

378
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,080
So I didn't say anything earlier.

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,560
Let's go for a drink together sometime.

380
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Are you inviting me?

381
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Hey.

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
Who would dare go drinking with a superstar?

383
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,090
Im still your old friend.

384
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,703
You can talk to me if anything.

385
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,419
Thinking of you.

386
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,515
Five, six, seven, eight.

387
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,875
One, two, three, four.

388
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
Five and six, seven, eight.

389
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,603
One, two, three, four.

390
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,760
Five, six.

391
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,520
Oh, wait a minute Wait a minute.

392
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,195
Uh! Bew.

393
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,400
Can you do it again.

394
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
But slowly

395
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,386
Gus, he couldn't keep up. Yeah?

396
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Yes, one more time.

397
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,250
Who's your dear.

398
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:51,899
He cant dance.

399
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,473
He cant sing.

400
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,715
Ahemm.

401
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,195
If you are that good.

402
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,173
Why dont you do the concert alone.

403
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Okay?

404
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,441
I can practice by myself.

405
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Bew go take a rest.

406
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,520
No Gus.

407
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:07,582
You two are partners.

408
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,920
You have to work together.

409
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Cannot.

410
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,600
If someone cant do it
Then let him practice.

411
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,735
Why should I let my child be tired.

412
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Mom.

413
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
I will practice with Gus.

414
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Please wait.

415
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
See.

416
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Pay attention.

417
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,423
Come on.

418
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,235
One, two, three and four.

419
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,447
Five, six Oh!

420
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Bew.

421
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:39,075
Bew, Bew, Bew
What's wrong with you?

422
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,000
Does it hurt?

423
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Get up first.

424
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Ouch.

425
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,035
Sis.

426
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,035
This is all because of you.

427
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,392
My son got hurt.

428
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,086
If my child gets hurt Its on you.

429
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,880
Do you understand?

430
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Mom.

431
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,040
I chose to dance

432
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,560
I fell down by myself.

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,040
Can you two stop fighting?

434
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,400
Gus, lets go back.

435
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,280
Do you want someone to
Take a look at your leg?

436
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
No.

437
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,680
I dont want to be here.

438
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,256
The atmosphere isnt very nice.

439
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,800
Even if I can dance
I dont want to.

440
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Let's go.

441
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,315
Its because of you.

442
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Of you.

443
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,887
Annoying.

444
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
What's wrong?

445
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Hmm.

446
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Stop biting your nails.

447
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Come.

448
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,495
Lets eat.

449
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,731
So you feel better soon.

450
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,480
Is it delicious?

451
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
It's delicious.

452
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Want some?

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Some more?

454
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:14,880
I will eat again later.

455
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,838
Gus, I am not feeling good.

456
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,493
Moms have been friends, sisters
Partners for a long time.

457
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,640
They shouldnt be fighting like this.

458
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,960
Sisters fight.

459
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,641
They will reconcile soon.

460
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,176
Look at us back then.

461
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,680
Was there a day,
You werent angry at me.

462
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
But what if they dont stop fighting.

463
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,002
I am scared we will be separated.

464
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
No way.

465
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,208
I will never let that happen.

466
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,680
(Have you left? Stop wasting time)

467
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Work?

468
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Um.

469
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,444
- Smile.
- Okay.

470
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Again.

471
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Bigger.

472
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Go to work.

473
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Go.

474
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Okay.

475
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
This.

476
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,680
It's here.

477
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
Smells really nice.

478
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,600
Finally finished my exams.

479
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Its been so long since I had your home made food.

480
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,240
Bew

481
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,480
I know I've been very busy these days.

482
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Lets do this.

483
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,699
Every once a week.

484
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,120
Lets have a mother-son day

485
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
I'll put it on the calendar.

486
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Okay?

487
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,480
Okay.

488
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,040
Talk about the calendar.

489
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Guess.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Which brand are you going to be presenter of.

491
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,200
Pure skin, like Punn?

492
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,566
(Pure skin - Trust us with your skin issues)
That's right.

493
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,560
I know, I know.

494
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,200
And we will also have the top spender campaign.

495
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
Top 10 spenders.

496
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Will get a photobook with your signature on it.

497
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
My signature.

498
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
What about Gus, mom.

499
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Um.

500
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,320
P' Pla, will he agree?

501
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,081
Bew.

502
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,040
That sis of mine.

503
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,160
Dealt with Hombre.

504
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
If he can do it.

505
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Why cant we.

506
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,520
So.

507
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,760
You just going to take back at each other like this.

508
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Mom.

509
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,440
You are friends.

510
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,800
Fighting with each other like this
Is it fun?

511
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Bew.

512
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Calm down first.

513
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,000
The client picked you.

514
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,280
And with top spenders.

515
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,840
The more you need to take the job.

516
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,240
If it sells well.

517
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
Other clients.

518
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,680
Would want to hire you.

519
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
And in just a bit.

520
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Your signature will have a lot of value.

521
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Bew.

522
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,280
Do you remember the Y Galaxy Award's
The Greatest Y award?

523
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
The one that PP got.

524
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,360
That is not for couple.

525
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,000
And in one year,
Only one of them is given out.

526
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,120
If you dont fight for it.

527
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,600
How will you get it.

528
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,095
Just remember.

529
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
That the Greatest Y award.

530
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,880
Is your greatest dream.

531
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
If you want it.

532
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
You have to fight for it.

533
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Will you fight?

534
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,240
Two, three, four.

535
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Five and.

536
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,280
Six.

537
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,071
Yes!

538
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Seven.

539
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,535
Eight.

540
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,960
This next.

541
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,480
Then like this.

542
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,120
Sis.

543
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,800
If Gus cant dance.

544
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,200
How about we let him dance at the back.

545
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,720
And let Bew dance with the dancers instead, okay?

546
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,680
No.

547
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Like this.

548
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes!

549
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,080
Then your son will get all the spotlight.

550
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,616
Anyway, Gus can already do it.

551
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,080
Do this and like this.

552
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
It's because you're stubborn.

553
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
The concert is not coming together.

554
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,160
Do you understand?

555
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,800
If I am this stubborn.

556
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,840
Then why hold the concert together?

557
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Are you okay?

558
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
You know Gus cant dance and sing.

559
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Then why are you doing the concert with me
Ha?

560
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,000
And you Look at him.

561
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
How he's doing it.

562
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
Stubborn and talking nonsense.

563
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
You keep dancing
Why did you stop.

564
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Whatever you are saying.

565
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
Can you respect me a little.

566
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I know I suck

567
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,840
I know I am not good at it.

568
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
But I am trying right.

569
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Damn it.

570
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,860
(Has the ship fallen? Gus and Bew are working separately.
Are they fighting? How will the future look like for these two?)

571
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,576
(Next Break)
P' Lookpla called me last night.

572
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,240
And told me to add one more song for you.

573
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,440
So you and Bew will be equal.

574
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,936
You think you can just do anything?

575
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,520
You think you can just change the show?

576
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Watch it.

577
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,960
If you know that your child cant do it.

578
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,776
You should've pulled him out since the beginning.

579
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,280
And none of this would be happening.

580
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,360
Too much
You're getting too much Toon.

581
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,680
Who said being an actor is easy.

582
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,360
We must be happy in front of everyone.

583
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,657
But inside Its terrible.

584
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
There's so much pressure.

585
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Here.

586
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
Sigh!

587
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:41,223
Cigarette?

588
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,520
Don't tell anyone.

589
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,320
I got alcohol at work.

590
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Yeah.

591
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,733
Umm.

592
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,840
What's wrong?

593
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,120
Stressed?

594
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,520
Lots of things going on.

595
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:28,960
Did you know.

596
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:30,840
P' Pla called me last night.

597
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,176
And told me to add one more song for you.

598
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,760
So you and Bew will have equal numbers.

599
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,200
Like.

600
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,160
I have to fix and fix it again
Never ending.

601
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
They keep competing.

602
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,686
Sigh!

603
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Mom.

604
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,349
About Gus.

605
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,879
I think.

606
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
The key of the song is really too high for Gus.

607
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,800
The tempo is also too fast.

608
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:15,944
If I never learnt singing and dancing
I wont be able to do it either.

609
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:16,920
Here.

610
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,680
I dont understand it either.

611
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:21,280
If he can't do it
Why not change it?

612
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,960
I think

613
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,640
Gus must be considerate of Yo.

614
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,320
P' Pla, has asked to make a lot of changes.

615
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:30,120
One more thing.

616
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,120
They are friends.

617
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:33,703
I think.

618
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:35,600
It would be difficult.

619
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:37,560
Im so annoyed.

620
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,480
(Urgent Meeting: A few changes in the show)

621
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Sis.

622
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,720
You think you can do anything?

623
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,480
You think you can just change the show?

624
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:58,355
What are you saying?

625
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,400
I didn't do it.

626
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:02,040
I am a true person.

627
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,680
I mean what I say.

628
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,520
Mom.

629
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,880
But isnt it good?

630
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Gus can sing and dance better.

631
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
How is that good?

632
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
The voice still sinks.

633
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,960
And the dance is so tiring.

634
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,120
You had to practiced so hard
You even hurt your leg.

635
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,176
What do you mean by had to practice.

636
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,280
Be careful of your mouth.

637
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,256
If you know that your child cant do it.

638
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,096
You should've pulled him out since the beginning.

639
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,720
None of this would be happening.

640
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,136
Too much
You're getting too much Toon.

641
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,800
Bring it on.

642
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
You want it?

643
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Toon You only.

644
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,620
- You are just pulling everything back.
- Let go, Mom.

645
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,455
- That's enough.
- Stop it.

646
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,840
And you never accept anything.

647
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
What did you say.

648
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,560
Sis.

649
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
Let go.

650
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I changed it.

651
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
I asked the musician to change the key of the song

652
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm sorry everyone.

653
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
For not informing before.

654
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Who the hell are you

655
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,046
Gus, no.

656
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
Your job was to plan
Do that well.

657
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
You dont have to worry about me

658
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
I am doing my job.

659
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
You were stressed.

660
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:08,640
You cant sing

661
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,200
I had to adjust to make it work.

662
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,560
If we had not known each other before.

663
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:14,440
Wold you have done this.

664
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:17,080
And what if it was some other artist.

665
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:18,840
Would you do this to them.

666
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:20,640
Calm down first, Gus.

667
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:22,560
Disgrace, what?

668
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,840
I did this to help you.

669
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:26,605
I felt pity for you.

670
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:28,416
Dont be.

671
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,347
All of you.

672
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:42,840
Mom.

673
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:48,915
Gus

674
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I'll take your leave.

675
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:55,672
Your fault.

676
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,560
It's not good for your health.

677
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,851
Gus.

678
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:43,560
I am really sorry.

679
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:44,680
Well.

680
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,360
I was the one to speak to Toon about you.

681
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,040
He might have heard it.

682
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:50,738
Thats enough.

683
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,827
Sigh.

684
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,680
I didn't think you will be angry.

685
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,720
I just wanted to help.

686
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,945
Yeah right

687
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:05,520
I am the problem.

688
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,040
Not like that Gus.

689
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:09,080
Isn't that right?

690
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:10,960
Then why talk behind my back.

691
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:13,280
If I'm the problem.

692
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,160
You dont have to speak to me.

693
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:17,880
Just pretend in front of the cameras.

694
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,640
Dont say that.

695
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,760
Everyones trying to help you here.

696
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:23,680
We all want the event to turn out well.

697
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,882
- Help me?
- Ouch.

698
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:37,850
Sorry.

699
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:50,222
Nevermind.

700
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:53,760
Who said being an actor is easy.

701
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:57,750
I want them to come try for themselves.

702
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,520
We must be happy in front of everyone.

703
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,320
When inside.

704
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:06,371
Im dying.

705
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
There's so much pressure.

706
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,890
If you feel its heavy.

707
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:12,560
Dont carry it alone.

708
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,160
Don't be mean to yourself.

709
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:19,566
Sorry.

710
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,400
I don't know what's wrong with me these days.

711
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:26,800
Im always thinking negatively.

712
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,275
I

713
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:33,381
I just want to be able to do it.

714
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,840
When someone tries to help.

715
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:39,146
It feels like they're looking down at me.

716
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:40,640
And.

717
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,280
I wont look good.

718
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,320
It's not like that, Gus.

719
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,440
The reason I spoke to mom about you.

720
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,960
Its because I care about you.

721
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,840
If you have anything, talk to me.

722
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,680
I am your boyfriend.

723
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:06,856
You dont have to prove anything to me.

724
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,440
And dont have to act strong with me.

725
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:09,777
Understand?

726
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
How many times do I need to get a complaint about you.

727
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:28,771
Huh?

728
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:30,360
Its

729
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,680
I've done the best I can.

730
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:36,120
With the fact that you change the key of his song.

731
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,120
If he cant sing.

732
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,120
Why didn't you take him to record.

733
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:41,680
Or auto tune.

734
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:43,480
Let him do lip sync.

735
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,162
But.

736
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,480
P' Pla said that Gus doesnt want that.

737
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,920
He wants to be able to sing on his own.

738
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:52,920
You're not a pro at all.

739
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,080
This isn't a school concert.

740
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:00,440
Seriously, are you okay?

741
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:02,080
If not, tell me

742
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,560
I'll let someone else do it instead.

743
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,873
Do you understand.

744
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:13,463

Bullied his own partner.

Apparently they are not as sweet as they seem to be.

Do you not think that.

774
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,440
That Bew will be in trouble as well.

775

Call the nurse.

I better go first today. Bye-bye.

799

How would I have known.

800
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,425
That during the live

801
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:46,963
Gus would drop the liquor bottle.

802
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:49,508
Did you think it was a plan.

803
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:49,966
Yes!

804
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:51,550
This story might sell well.

805
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,840
Should we try selling.

806
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:54,008
Do you want it? Do you?

807
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,583
You chose this yourself, Toon.

808

You started this.

809

832

This product is a healthy product

845

Gus is probably not a good fit.

846
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,840
Oh yes, I understand.

847
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:38,300
We've already heard about this.

848

00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:50,279
Hmm.

862
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:56,081
Take.

863
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,108
(Let's rehearse the script after dinner)

864
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:04,214
(I will go live Sangsoy with you <3)

865
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:08,216
Bew.

866
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:10,341
Help mom mix it up quickly.

867
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,883
Yes mom.

868
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:13,883
This one.

869
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,091
Do you know how to do it?

870
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:17,341
Yes.

871
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:24,383
Little bit.

872
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:30,383
Soy San.

873
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,759
Pasturized Soy milk.

874
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:33,883
But.

875
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,216
Definitely healthy.

876
00:48:37,216 --> 00:48:39,341
And bright just like Bew, right?

877
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,191
One more time.

878
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:42,276
Make it a little more flow.

879
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,924
Soy San.

880
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,133
Pasturized Soy milk.

881
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:46,133
Hello P' Toon

882
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,339
Gus.

883
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,383
How did you come.

884
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:50,091
A good manager.

885
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:51,840
Must be able to do everything.

886
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:55,175
Its not that hard.

887
00:48:56,091 --> 00:48:58,924
Just bring the latest Hombre Top Spender balance
To negotiate.

888
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:01,178
The clients almost invited Gus to live together.

889
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,427
Lets go Gus.

890
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,590
Let's go back to our room.

891
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:04,380
Wait a minute.

892
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:06,300
Do we have to separate rooms?

893
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:06,717
Oh.

894
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:08,175
Dear.

895
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:09,216
We do.

896
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,008
How can Gus's 200000 spender.

897
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:15,175
Be in the same room as Bew 120000.

898
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:16,592
Sis.

899
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:18,924
Your fight is with me.

900
00:49:19,383 --> 00:49:20,966
Leave my child alone.

901
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:24,467
That is enough, P' Pla, P' Toon.

902
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:27,942
If you don't care about yourselves.

903
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,102
You should care about us.

904
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,592
Me and Bew.

905
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
We are in a relationship.

906
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:35,028
We still have to work together.

907
00:49:36,008 --> 00:49:37,840
You can't fight like this every time.

908
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,216
I'm sleepy

909
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,300
I'll go wait in the room.

910
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:06,924
See you soon.

911
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:13,091
Nothing.

912
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:15,508
My fight is with sis, not you Gus.

913
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:16,773
Here.

914
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:18,091
Before you go.

915
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,383
Take some brownies.

916
00:50:20,425 --> 00:50:21,800
From your FC Here.

917
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,300
Thank you.

918
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,050
Bew.

919
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,717
Could you please come to the set.

920
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:50,633
Dress up to play tennis.

921
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:53,341
Soy Sang Pasturized Soy milk.

922
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,924
Drink and you will be healthy just like me.

923
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,614
Very good.

924
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,308
Is it?

925
00:50:58,633 --> 00:50:59,183
Or should it be.

926
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:01,258
Soy san Soy san Soy san.

927
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,091
Bew, you have to live alone first.

928
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:04,788
You can use the original script.

929
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:06,592
Why? What happened?

930
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,216
Where is Gus?

931
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,202
Gus.

932
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,966
What's wrong Gus?

933
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:13,759
Gus.

934
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:15,800
Call the nurse.

935
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:17,425
Anyone.

936
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:18,133
Help.

937
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:19,675
Breathe. Breath first.

938
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:20,841
Take a breath.

939
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,091
Slowly.

940
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:24,508
Call the ambulance.

941
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:27,717
Take a deep breath slowly.

942
00:51:27,883 --> 00:51:30,096
Calm down.

943
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:32,717
He's at the hospital now.

944
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
And safe.

945
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,295
Bew, go into the live first.

946
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,008
Who can do it?

947
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:38,240
Mom, let's go.

948
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:39,383
Bew, you cant.

949
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,300
We have to finish the shoot.

950
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,633
Or they can sue us.

951
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:04,633
Slowly.

952
00:52:04,774 --> 00:52:05,431
Um.

953
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:09,759
Feeling better?

954
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:18,607
Good boy.

955
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:20,650
Thank you.

956
00:52:20,759 --> 00:52:22,079
For doing the live instead of me.

957
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:26,759
If I could choose.

958
00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:28,776
I'd rather be at the hospital with you.

959
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:32,425
Come here.

960
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:40,050
It's good that I took my inhaler.

961
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:41,508
So it's okay.

962
00:52:43,216 --> 00:52:43,864
And.

963
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:45,326
Why are you still having symptoms?

964
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:47,425
What did you eat.

965
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:49,696
Well.

966
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:53,717
I only ate the snacks from the fans that Toon gave.

967
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:56,601
Brownies?

968
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:57,919
Um.

969
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,008
Are you sure?

970
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:02,467
Did you look properly?

971
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:03,567
That there were no shrimp.

972
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:07,165
Nope.

973
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,005
Umm.

974
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:54,841
Damn.

975
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:15,133
Hello!
Gus.

976
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:18,175
There are shrimp shells in the brownies.

977
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,300
Somebody purposely gave this to you.

978
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:25,966
And I can guess who.

979
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:29,687
What?

980
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:31,508
Hitting each other?

981
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:33,091
Where?

982
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:36,341
Alright, I'll be there.

983
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:45,633
Do you understand?

984
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:48,300
Gus could've died.

985
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:55,008
P' Pla.

986
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:57,175
Calm down first.

987
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Listen to me first.

988
00:54:58,841 --> 00:54:59,091
Its.

989
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:02,067
Mommy Toon had no idea
that Gus would be at the live today.

990
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,091
You come too late.

991
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,717
Your mother confessed everything to me.

992
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:19,966
I saw the Line chat between you and Gus.

993
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:24,603
(Let's rehearse the script after dinner)
(I will go live Sangsoy with you <3)

994
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,592
Bew, I'm sorry.

995
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,091
I didnt mean to.

996
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:36,467
I am sorry.

997
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,650
I really don't know.

998
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,840
That Gus would have to go to the hospital.

999
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:44,341
Sorry.

1000
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,541
If you want to comfort each other
You can go do at home.

1001
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:52,341
And after the concert finishes.

1002
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:54,883
Disperse.

1003
00:55:57,341 --> 00:55:58,621
And dont ever come see me again.

1004
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:05,675
Sis, I know I am wrong.

1005
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:07,198
I know.

1006
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:10,717
And I know you're angry.

1007
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,717
But can you not decide anything yet?

1008
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:20,050
You decide from the moment.

1009
00:56:20,216 --> 00:56:22,840
You gave my son the poisonous brownie, Toon.

1010
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:28,966
Get out.

1011
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:34,133
Lets go.

1012
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:36,483
Bew.

1013
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:38,091
Can I stay back with Gus.

1014
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:41,174
You too.

1015
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:43,883
Leave.

1016
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:48,412
Why?

1017
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,383
You have a fight with Toon, go ahead.

1018
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:53,816
But you have no right to stop me from.

1019
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,091
Taking care of Gus.

1020
00:56:58,091 --> 00:56:59,633
I and Gus are in a relationship.

1021
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:02,920
Relationship?

1022
00:57:03,675 --> 00:57:04,420
What relationship?

1023
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
A fake one?

1024
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:21,091
Thats not true.

1025
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:24,341
Not true, right, Gus?

1026
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:27,924
Bew.

1027
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:29,467
Thats not true right?

1028
00:57:34,924 --> 00:57:36,633
Tell me it's not true.

1029
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:39,091
It was really P' Pla's plan.

1030
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,091
But Bew, listen to me first.

1031
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:45,675
Everything that I did with you.

1032
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:50,050
How can you do this to me.

1033
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:52,717
Enough, Bew.

1034
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:55,841
Gus is not well.

1035
00:57:57,008 --> 00:57:58,008
Go back.

1036
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,133
You can say.

1037
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Try being me.

1038
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,924
Dint you say we are a family.

1039
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:20,505
Then how could you do this.

1040
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:23,008
How could you mess with me.

1041
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,550
How could you play with my feelings.

1042
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:31,467
Bew, listen.

1043
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:35,683
If you scold me.

1044
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:39,406
Then you have to scold your mom too.

1045
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:52,341
I thought of telling you, Bew.

1046
00:58:54,008 --> 00:58:55,008
If Bew refuses.

1047
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:56,541
Don't force.

1048
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,133
Do not do anything.

1049
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,356
Do you understand?

1050
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:01,643
You have to make him believe that.

1051
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:02,667
You really love him.

1052
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:05,425
If you want to be in this industry.

1053
00:59:05,717 --> 00:59:06,717
You have to be like this.

1054
00:59:07,883 --> 00:59:08,425
Sis.

1055
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,924
Bew looks really stressed.

1056
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,425
He's waiting in the car.

1057
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,091
I'm afraid he will find out.

1058
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:18,837
You. Dint you notice your son
during the acting class.

1059
00:59:19,258 --> 00:59:20,341
Did you see?

1060
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,091
Okay Talk to you later

1061
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:25,479
Gus likes girls.

1062
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,924
What the hell?

1063
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:29,966
Phi Pla.

1064
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:31,759
Bew ran away.

1065
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:33,216
Dont you see?

1066
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,175
I told you to act short but to the point

1067
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:36,483
Gus.

1068
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:39,759
Go after him.

1069
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:42,216
I really don't want Bew to be sad.

1070
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:44,323
Yes.

1071
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,592
And Bew should not know about this.

1072
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:48,091
Until Gus and Bew.

1073
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:49,840
Will become the number 1 Y couple in Siam.

1074
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:51,091
Do you understand?

1075
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:53,924
But Bew, do you know.

1076
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:56,592
You look very happy with Gus.

1077
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:59,341
So I didn't say anything.

1078
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:01,467
That is it.

1079
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:04,341
Gus's feelings for you.

1080
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
Are real.

1081
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:08,425
It's not a scam at all.

1082
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:11,383
Believe me.

1083
01:00:11,924 --> 01:00:12,634
Please.

1084
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,341
Please.

1085
01:00:20,759 --> 01:00:21,759
My happiness.

1086
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:24,550
It was all a fake.

1087
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,520
No.

1088
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:39,633
Everything that you did.

1089
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:42,966
All of this.

1090
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:44,841
Was it for publicity.

1091
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:54,800
Bew, I am sorry for everything.

1092
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,883
I'm sorry for everything.

1093
01:01:00,216 --> 01:01:01,383
Whatevery you want me to do.

1094
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,383
I can do it all. I promise

1095
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:04,675
I will do everything

1096
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:06,258
I promise.

1097
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:08,966
How do you want me to trust you.

1098
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:12,077
You have broken all of it already.

1099
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:27,550
Let me ask.

1100
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:28,883
Was there anything true.

1101
01:01:33,425 --> 01:01:34,425
Bew.

1102
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:36,175
Dear.

1103
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,903
You are in the entertainment industry.

1104
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:43,759
No one likes the truth.

1105
01:01:47,258 --> 01:01:48,592
The more it's fake.

1106
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:50,633
The more it sells.

1107
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:54,841
The more people like it.

1108
01:01:58,633 --> 01:01:59,633
Fighting.

1109
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,800
Umm.

1110
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:08,425
If the industry is like this.

1111
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:12,084
Then I dont want to be in it.

1112
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,633
Sis, damn you.

1113
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,341
Tit for tat sister.

1114
01:02:26,924 --> 01:02:27,924
Wait a minute.

1115
01:02:28,883 --> 01:02:29,883
Where are you going?

1116
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:31,255
You're in pain, aren't you?

1117
01:02:34,883 --> 01:02:35,923
Bew is hurt, more than me.

1118
01:02:58,091 --> 01:02:59,091
What is wrong?

1119
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,008
No more like this.

1120
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:02,508
Bew.

1121
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:04,085
Bew.

1122
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:07,841
Title, Managers war.

1123
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,841
Story starts from manager.

1124
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,759
But the people affected.

1125
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:16,091
Are not just the managers.

1126
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
Then like this.

1127
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:20,840
Is it fair?

1128
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:24,601
(Gus Bew announced a break)

1129
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:27,881
(Next Week)
Think about it.

1130
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,966
The couple's popularity has already reached its peak.

1131
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:32,759
Im human too.

1132
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:34,467
You are human.

1133
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:35,992
But you are not an ordinary person.

1134
01:03:37,008 --> 01:03:38,717
You are a people's person.

1135
01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:42,966
Yes.

1136
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:44,633
The person in the clip is me.

1137
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,383
How do you know.

1138
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:45,592
Bew.

1139
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:47,341
How can you do this to me.

1140
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:47,841
Bew calm down.

1141
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:49,300
Stop being crazy Toon.

1142
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:50,966
I don't know

1143
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:51,717
I didn't do it

1144
01:03:51,924 --> 01:03:52,924
I don't know.

1145
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,341
At the event, someone did drugs.

1146
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:56,383
If Gus goes to jail

1147
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:57,717
I don't care
