- Explain to me!

If it was you, would you be calm?

166
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,822
Or do I have to bow for them as well?

167
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,355
Pan.

168
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,533
I want you to listen,
not to tell me to calm down.

169
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,711
What else do I have left to be cool of?
It took everything from me.

170
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,466
I don't have anything left.

171
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,777
Pan.

172
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,266
That's why I told you to calm down

173
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
to make up your mind.

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,400
You're not alone.

175
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,026
You still have me.

176
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:35,276
I will help you.

177
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:38,609
Help me?

178
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,026
What will you help with?

179
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,688
Aren't you the one who stole my dream?

180
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,933
You know all along that
I want to be in TV.

181
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,555
Then why are you doing this?

182
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,755
You don't want to be in TV.
Don't even want to be an actor.

183
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,288
You're just a rich person
wanting to be famous.

184
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,622
People like you without money,
there's no way you're here.

185
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,355
Pan.

186
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,222
I'll just think that you have said this
because you are not sane.

187
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,244
What does it need sanity for?

188
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,600
You saw what does this industry want?

189
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,622
It's not talent or effort.

190
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,400
It only requires superficiality.

191
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,644
Beauty.

192
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:26,822

193

Millionaire.

194
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,533
Anything that makes it look so high
that it can't be reached.

195
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,177
So it chooses you.

196
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,622
Because you are one of them, not me.

197
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,666
Because you are one of them.

198
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:38,692
Pan.

199
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You think like this

200
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,603
because you're no different.

201
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,133
Yes,

202
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,511
I used to be like that.

203
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,644
I used to see you as a boat to get me forward,

204
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,800
but today if that boat is useless,

205
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,600
I just don't have to keep it.

206
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,622
What you said, have you thought about it?

207
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,866
I was just that to you?

208
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,984
So I must be wrong

209
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,066
to have fallen in love with you.

210
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:51,688
So...

211
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,355
So today I no longer any use to you.

212
00:16:58,525 --> 00:16:59,859
You take good care of yourself.

213
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,390
Because you're stupid.

214
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,276
Because you're stupid

215
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,511
to have loved someone like me.

you were going do TV?

Just do it, you're lucky.

You have a good, comfortable job,
you don't have to work hard like the others.

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,577
Isn't it normal?

333
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,311
The craft service asked for more.

334
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,355
Just like that?

335
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,910
What should I cut down first?

336
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,511
It can't be cut anymore.

337
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,977
P'Pat.

338
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,000
I want to talk to you.

339
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,244
Oh, what's up?
I thought you were on set.

340
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,644
Why is my scenes lessen?

341
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,977
It can't be because of the rumors,
they don't matter.

342
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,044
They don't matter.

343
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,577
It's not about the news.

344
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,111
Then why?

345
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,466
It's season 2.
I want to have some new actors.

346
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,155
And the customer wants it this way.
I feel bad as well.

347
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,200
What customer wants more scene for
the 2nd couple than the first couple?

348
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,266
P'Pat, I ask you for real.

349
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,533
What did I do wrong?
Or if I didn't play well so I can improve.

350
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,822
You can tell me.

351
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,410
It's nothing.
Go get ready to go on set.

352
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,511
The customer...

353
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,511
of the series or yours?

354
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,376
What now?

355
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,711
I know that you talked to P'Koon.

356
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,800
What did she give you that you have to do this?

357
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,200
Pan.

358
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:09,292
Why would you give up your dignity?

359
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,222
You're willing to destroy your own series
just for a bag of money?

360
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,422
Pan, I admit that you're talented person.

361
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,111
But please stop thinking
that you're the only talented one.

362
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,177
Without you, my series won't be ruined.

363
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,133
There are other people
that are good and much better than you.

364
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,467
Let's go, Mod.
Let's talk about craft service.

365
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,955
Hey, don't you want to do something?

366
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,311
You're in trouble too, aren't you?

367
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,333
Why are you like this, Nong Pan?

368
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,511
Calm down.

369
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,866
Stop faking.

370
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,088
Let these fuckers take all the scene?

371
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,866
I don't see any problem.

372
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,888
Give the chance to other people.

373
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,022
At this level,

374
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,244
you better spend time at events

375
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,733
or discuss the project with TV channels.

376
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,133
Oh, you don't worry about it.

377
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,511
I wanna know how this series will be
without me.

378
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,155
Have you ever read that people
think your series sucks?

379
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,177
Your series sucks that
I have to carry the whole crew

380

381
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,022
Stay with this shitty work.

382
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,933
I wanna know if this series doesn't have me,
who will watch them.

383

00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:02,709
Yes.

489
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,088
Does he often behave like that?

490
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,377
No, he's a good actor of the industry.

491
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:13,533
What about Bew?
Have you seen any strange behavior?

492
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,167
None at all.

493
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,311
P'Pan works hard and is very good at it.

494
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,088
Especially when he has other series to play.
He just did one take through every set.

495
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,511
Two series in one day?

496
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,000
Can you even do that?

497
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,333
Yes. And he is very kind.

498
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:32,777
He also brought an ice machine to the set.

499
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,674
If anyone want to use this, just let him know.

500
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,955
Sometimes he allowed people to use it.

501
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,288
Very kind.

502
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,066
Alright, let me take a couple of pictures.

503
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:44,918
Oh, yes.

504
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,777
- Closer please.
- Closer, closer.

505
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,777
Ah good!

506
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,209
Good! Cute!

507
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:15,422
Hello, Fang.

508
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,733
Hello, Pan.

509
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:27,822
(Horrible people thrive everywhere.)

510
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,170
What the fuck are you doing?

511
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,422
I must be the one to ask you that.

512
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,044
How did you get that contract?

513
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:46,644
She took you whoring, didn't she?

514
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,000
She's good at that.

515
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,755
Deceiving children to sell to managers.

516
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:57,377
You know I can report your words to the police?

517
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:58,999
Did you have proof?

518
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Proof?

519
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,488
I'll get it right away.

520
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:08,044
Let's go.

521
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,870
How dare you go up with such a scandal?

522
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,377
Oh, but then you're so used to each other.

523
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,111
Well, we have jobs to do.

524
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,654
But you probably don't understand

525
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,497
because you did not get
to be in the same spot as me.

526
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,933
What spot?

527
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:28,667
What are you talking about?

528
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:29,250
Come here.

529
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:30,000
Hey.

530
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:30,751
Oh, P'Koon.

531
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:33,125
Stop now. I told you to stop.

532
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,422
Stop it.

533
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,444
Pan, calm down.

534
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:42,334
Calm down.

535
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:44,334
What's the matter, Fang?

536
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,466
Ask him yourself.

537
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,133
If he's this crazy, put a good leash on him.

538
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,800
- Pan, Pan, Pan!
- Independent artists have no one to teach manners.

539
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:02,866
Let's go.

540
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,155
OK, P'Koon.

541
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,844
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

542
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,111
How..

543
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:28,377
How did you know his name is Fang?

544
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,644
Did you sleep with him?

545
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,688
(Next Week)
These envelopes

546
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:59,733
contains a list of famous executives,
politicians and businessmen

547
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:05,022
that P'Koon took me to meet,
telling me it's a tryout for presenters.

548
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:06,667
Seriously,

549
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,133
don't you feel sorry for him?
What did he do to you?

550
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,977
I don't think I need to be sorry for anyone.

551
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:17,876
If we invest, we must get back.

552
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,422
I want to compensate for everything.

553
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:23,667
I can take it if it makes you feel comfortable

554
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:28,231
but don't expect me to forgive
or go back to the way thing was.

555
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,100
Because the old Pan is not here anymore.
