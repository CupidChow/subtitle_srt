5
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,000
Look at Peek and Kla's chemistry.

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
They will be a hit.

7
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:10,111
They were even known
before entering the Y Idol house.

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,760
I feel...

9
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,666
Kla is a bit chubby.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,955
Real size beauty is now in K.Tai.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,520
But how will he compete with the muscular
and lean ones in the market?

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,444
Even if they are real but can't sell,

13
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:28,666
I will be in trouble.

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
I think...

15
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,377
He is more interesting.

(War Of Y)
(Episode 15)

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,911
Oh, that's a lot.

18
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,440
Wait and watch

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,288
I know you want me to eat.

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,022
I'm going to try it.

21
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:29,422
Yeah.

22
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,311
This is edible.

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,880
Don't you want to try it again.

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,933
No more.

25
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,222
- I'm tired.
- But it's delicious.

26
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:37,840
Yep.

27
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:39,560
See, I told you.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,222
Umm.

29
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,680
And it's not that stale.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,688
Hey.

31
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,088
Why haven't you finished eating your food?

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
- Keep it away first.
- Okay.

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
- Yes.
- Quickly.

34
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,244
Dew and P are here. Quickly keep it.

35
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,022
Please wait. Just a moment.

36
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:54,888
Sure.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Sorry.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,577
Dew, can you stand this side
and P go over there?

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,777
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,155
Okay. Lovely.

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
Everyone ready? Cameraman ready?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,120
Sound and speed?

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,933
Three, two, action.

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,016
(It's already the last day *cry)
(Waiting to watch their series)
- Going on sets is a little tiring right?
- Not just a little.

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
(Most is so handsome)
Very tiring.

46
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,844
Real life is going to be more tiring than this Most.

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,300
(How will we know if P's dialogues are scripted)
Some sets will need you many days back to back.

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,856
(How will we know if P's dialogues are scripted)

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,680
(He's pulling his face and talking like an old man)
Are your dreams...

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,540
(Why is Most not holding Achi's shoulder?)
(He kissed Peek so maybe he's swayed)

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,020
(Why is Most not holding Achi's shoulder?)
(He kissed Peek so maybe he's swayed)
big enough to fight for it?

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,776
(Why is Most not holding Achi's shoulder?)
(He kissed Peek so maybe he's swayed)

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,936
(Who wrote script for P. So fake)
(The mentor is sounding very sleepy)

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
We will fight.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,955
(Support my shop please)
(Anything more fake than this
should be the salt mine market)
I've seen the footage.

56
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,280
Everyone did really well.

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,496
(Someone was slower to speak than others. Anyone else noticed?)
(Dew so sincere, did he even watch it) Wow, thank you.

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
And the final decision
will be from the special show.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,576
(Earth finally got a chance to speak, my little ketchup)
and answering the questions.

60
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,088
Keep practicing hard.

61
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,440
(Achi looks quiet today. So weird. Did he fight with Most)
Yes.

62
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:44,940
(Answering the question? Finding actor or finding the crew)
(Confused with finding new actors tweet but competing for singing and dancing)

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,620
(Answering the question? Finding actor or finding the crew)
(Confused with finding new actors tweet but competing for singing and dancing)
Don't forget.

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,530
(Answering the question? Finding actor or finding the crew)
(Confused with finding new actors tweet but competing for singing and dancing)

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,720
Your dreams.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,911
(What song is the special song? Cappuccino, espresso
Arabica / Latte Latte)
Will come true easier.

67
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,600
If you have someone to help you.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
(Benja Keeta song / *Kin jup jip song)
And support you on the way.

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,060
(The comment above is an LGBT / Song for
Korn (Esaan song name))

70
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,140
(The comment above is an LGBT / Song for
Korn (Esaan song name))
I will wait and watch.

(The comment above is an LGBT / Song for
Korn (Esaan song name))

Y Idol.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,520
(Are you sure you play a lot of series?
Your voice is very monotonous)
(Cheering like in a university play)
Y Idol. Yay.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,560
Cut.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,760
Amazing.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,155
- Dew and P, can go rest first.
- Thank you.

77
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:12,720
Hey guys, I will go give Namwaan a quick shower.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,577
- Ok, I'll come soon.
- Sure.

79
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:17,177
Peek.

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Keep fighting. I'm cheering for you.

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,222
Thank you.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,240
Okay. Listen here everyone.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,155
We will now have
individual interviews. Ok?

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,560
That will be posted on AIS Play.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
You will get a question.

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,096
And will have to write your answer on a paper.

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
Question is, if you are not the winner.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,555
If you do not win, who do you want them to win Y Idol.

89
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,577
Get it?

90
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,960
Yes.

91
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:45,320
After you write your answer,
show it to the camera, and give your reason.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Okay?

93
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
- Sure.
- Everyone got it.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,000
Alright!

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,066
Great. Korn, stay first.

96
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,022
Korn stay back.
Others can go and rest first.

97
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,160
We will call you one by one.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
- Okay.
- Go rest.

99
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Yes.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,733
If not me, I want Earth to win.

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,955
Earth is talented.

102
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,022
Very responsible.

103
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,288
No matter what you give him, he will do it.

104
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,555
He is not hungry for publicity.

105
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,688
He doesn't care about
winning or competing with anyone.

106
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,622
He just loves what he's doing.

107
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:19,444
Korn is the eldest
and has the highest responsibility.

108
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,533
He takes care of everyone.

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,355
He creates good vibes.

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,240
Creates laughter for me...

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,440
and everyone in the house.

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,644
Cut.

113
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,822
Peek.

114
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,533
Can we add a little more.

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,111
Can you please, wait, let me keep this first.

116
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,644
And I want you to.

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,977
Say something about Most and Korn.

118
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,111
We will use this for editing.

119
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:51,520
Um, Peek.

120
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:55,000
While speaking, can you also write the name
and show it to the camera?

121
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,066
Okay.

122
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,266
Hey, who did you answer?

123
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,711
I will show you after its on.

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,200
Who else will you answer if not me?

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,733
Oh and have you finished packing?

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,688
Crap.

127
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,333
I forgot about it.

128
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,800
I don't know what will happen after I go back.

129
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Hey, don't be tensed.

130
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
It will get better.

131
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Trust me.

132
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,577
Dad.

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,044
You really not coming with me?

134
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,488
Today is the final day.

135
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:03,920
Can't you see mom?

136
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
I am busy.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,880
But this is Peek's dream.

138
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:13,355
Peek wants your support.

139
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,066
I'm leaving then.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,555
Yeah.

141
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:28,333
Goodbye.

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
(Discuss the following phrase.)

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,960
(As a father, he forced his child to do new things.)
(Without thinking about his child's feelings)

144
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
(Forced his child to do new things.)
(Without thinking about his child's feelings)

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Cut.

146
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,355
Okay Most, really good.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,555
Yes.

148
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,155
Most, can you take this drink for Peek?

149
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,760
Why me?

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,466
Well... Pond has sent it for him.

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,400
If from Dew's team, Achi does not win.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Can you distance yourself from Achi for me.

153
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:33,844
Sure.

154
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,888
Thank you very much.

155
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,044
Peek.

156
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,755
Haven't seen you for so long. I miss you.

157
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:55,360
I miss you too Most.

158
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:56,800
I miss the time we were singing.

159
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
♪ Since when... ♪

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,955
New song already.

161

Here.

162
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Before you pass out like last time.

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,244
You got this for me?

164
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,155
Yeah.

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,977
Thank you.

166
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:24,777
Refreshing.

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,333
You feel refreshing, I feel refreshed too.

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,288
Hey Most.

169
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Here you are.

170
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,688
I was looking for you.

171
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,400
Come on, lets go pack our things.

172
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,400
They are calling for the run through.

173
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:51,355
Let's go, Most.

174
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,555
Let's go pack.

175
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,911
Never mind. We won't be using it anyway.

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,960
Is this the right key, Most?

177
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,911
Let's go.

178
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,444
The car is here.

179
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,044
Come on.

180
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
I want to do my best. So we can win like.

181
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,120
The promise we gave to Pla and Toon.

182
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,088
I want you to distance yourself from Kla for me.

183
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,488
Go.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,400
Crew.

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Pond has called a meeting.

186
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,066
Oh... Everyone.

187
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,733
Keep practising.
We will come back in 5 minutes.

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Sure.

189
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,733
Okay then...

190
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
I've to start?

191
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, you go first.

192
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,711

Achi.

202
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,133
What is your problem.

203
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,444
And why are you siding (taking) with him Most?

204
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,444
Taking what.

205
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,133
I'm still dressed.

206
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,244
Not funny.

207
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,288
Calm down.

208
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,977
You guys are fighting till the last week.

209
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,200
It's the finals.

210
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,488
Focus on the practise.

211
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,133
Focus?

212
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,600
Why rehearse when you won't even win?

213
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,955
The show has already locked the winners.

214
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,960
Why are you coming back to the same point?

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
Because you are so dumb.

216
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,311
They are selling away your dreams.

217
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,880
Hey Achi.

218
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,777
This is too much.

219
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Don't mess in this.

220
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,177
What kind of couple are you?

221
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,311
Why didn't they lock you with Peek?

222
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,355
And why do you hate me so much?

223
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,222
Why are you stealing my partner?

224
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,533
Why aren't you pairing with Kla?

225
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,088
Aren't you secretly dating?

226
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
What the heck? Stop speaking nonsense.

227
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,911
Where did you get this from?

228
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:20,000
Why is Pond giving
you whatever you want?

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,444
If you don't know, then don't speak.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,555
I know everything about you faking.
Playing game all along.

231
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:29,066
Don't you have any confidence in your own abilities?

232
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,320
And you too.

233
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,930
You're afraid of losing.
That's why you keep fighting with me right.

234
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:34,511
Peek.

235
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:36,488
I'm not afraid of losing.

236
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,200
I know I'm good.

237
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
But a talented person like me.
Is losing to a cheater like you?

238
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,644
You cheated.

239
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,155
Achi. You are still being punished.

240
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:48,622
If you're really talented.
Why did you always get roles in adult movies?

241
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:49,680
Peek.

242
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Leave me. Hey.

243
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,688
Peek.

244
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,333
What the hell.

245
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,822
What's wrong with you?

246
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,288
Are you out of your mind Achi?
Peek, are you okay?

247
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,456
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Most and Peek are good. We didn't tell them directly
but they understood it and serving the moment like it was scripted)

248
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,496
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: And what? If someone else's vote is higher,
will Pond still be selfish and let these two win?)

249
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520

(Aom: That's why he's calling a meeting now.
Insider news is that, Achi's brother is letting his whole company do the voting)

250
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,536
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Pond has a back up plan.
He's tricking Achi into breaking the rule)

251
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,333
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Aom: No need to trick. Outside team is saying
that Achi just punched Peek inside the studio)

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,533
(Next Break)
Just one more day.

253
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:12,844
And we don't have to see each other again.

254
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,600
Let go all the drama.

255
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,200
Let go the competition.

256
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:18,555
We just have to do our best.

257
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,466
For the people who are cheering us.

258
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,088
For our FC.

259
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:23,911
For ourselves.

260
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,280
Y Idol.

261
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:26,733
Woo!

262
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,088
What's with you all?

263
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
You came here to be an idol.

264
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
To be inspiration for others.

265
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,088
But in the end, acting like this.

266
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,400
How can you be inspiration for anyone.

267
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,066
Get up, slowly.

268
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:16,133
Peek.

269
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,155
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,066
I didn't mean to.

271
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,866
I lost it.

272
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Don't complain.

273
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:28,577
Don't tell Gateway.

274
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,666
Please.

275
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,111
At least let me perform first.

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,555
This show is very important to me.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,160
Please Peek.

278
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:41,480
Are these real tears or just creating a story.

279
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:53,800
Enough.

280
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,644
I won't tell.

281
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,400
Truth is, I am no better than you.

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,266
Maybe even worse.

283
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,800
Everyone.

284
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,777
I lied about my leg.

285
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,600
Sigh!

286
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,844
I played games.

287
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,866
I chose Most during the singing week so I can survive.

288
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,777
I agitated Korn.

289
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,022
I hurt Earth.

290
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,600
I acted terrible with Kla and Achi.

291
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,622
I'm really sorry.

292
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,688
I am sorry, from my heart.

293
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:46,111
But about locking and not locking the winner

294
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,888
I really don't know.

295
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm only a teacher's son.

296
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,666
I don't have the capacity to conspire with Pond.

297
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
I feel really uncomfortable.

298
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,688
When will it all end?

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,622
Hey, you all.

300
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,288
I think...

301
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,066
Just let it go.

302
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:47,888
Just one more day.

303
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,133
And we don't have to see each other again.

304
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,600
Let go all the drama. Let go the competition.

305
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,911
Please?

306
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
It's my request.

307
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,155
We just have to do our best.

308
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,066
For the people who are cheering us.

309
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:13,644
For our FC.

310
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,622
For ourselves.

311
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:22,666
Come on.

312
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,177

how do you feel?

342

If we don't meet, I will really miss him.

I don't understand. Our couple is perfect.

00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:40,080
Can?

480
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
(If he says each other, it would be hilarious)
(Answer them, this is so good)

481
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,936
- Eat with Korn.
- Eat with Earth.

482
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,320
(They answered)
(Screammm)

483
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,755
Answer at the same time too.

484
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,980
(Sadly, Korn is too old.
He could win this if he were younger)
Let them go rest first.
A round of applause please.

485
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,140
(This is TTV we're talking about. Obviously, they won't
sign Korn especially with his background.)
Let them go rest first.
A round of applause please.

486
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,840
(I know you're ageist, but racist too?)
Let them go rest first.
A round of applause please.

487
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,000
(Won't the judge talk about the mission?
Oh it's a Thai reality show)
Thank you.

488
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
If I knew that after finishing this show

489
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,960
I will get to work like this.

490
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,355
Its even more fun.

491
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,577
Most.

492
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,240
But in the end, you forgot right.

493
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,888
What kind of person I am, I don't even know.

494
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,311
The dialogue is wrong.

495
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,222
I want you to be better.

496
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,733
Don't act weak like when you are outside.

497
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:25,840
Haven't seen you for so long

498
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,822
I miss you.

499
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:28,977
Do you want Most to win.

500
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,622
If you want me to win, please vote for me.

501
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,440
(MostAchi's highlight without Achi in it? Is this Getsunova)
(MV? Not only confused but very confused They only want #MostPeek?)

502
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,980
Hello Most, Achi.

503
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,056
(Lets start an organization to get back all of Achi's airtime)
(Judges are only talking about shipping, what about their acting)
How's it?

504
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,844
(They are focusing on Peek, so clear)
Most first.

505
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,555
(Don't know how to comment on acting so talk about the charm instead)
When we played, it was charming.

506
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,088
Looks cute, cuddly.

507
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,400
The only thing was.

508
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,490
(Where are all the acting coaches)
(They comment as viewers, don't act too dumb)
Achi, it was like...

509
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,466
You said the wrong dialogue.

510
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,256
(Achi's face turned pale)
But its okay, the meaning...

511
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,960
Can still be understood.

512
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,520
How are you feeling Most?
It's the last week already.

513
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,816
(Just one dialogue, what kind of person I am)
Playing with Achi is so easy.

514
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,000
(Is that such a big mistake)
What do you mean by that, hmm?

515
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,511
(Does K. Tai have a problem with Achi See you tomorrow in)
(front of TTV Going to give him encouragement? Going to burn it down)

516
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,044
(Most, can you do some servicing)
(Achi knows something Achi didn't act that bad Shock feels)
Achi is very professional. He helps me and guides me.

517
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,296
(Excuse me, we got a very serious interview going on here)
Lastly, please promote...

518
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,176
(Talk about the next couple. Why? I'm confused)
(Pushing #MostPeek a little much here)
the next couple. What do you have to say to them?

519
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Well... I'd like everyone...

520
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,816
(Youngest member, my heart)
to cheer our youngest member...

521
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,720
(Peek's FC is as worse as him)
of the house too.

522
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,376
(Guys I am so angry with the show. Look at Achi's face)
Round of applause please.

523
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,880
(If the tables turn, its going to be a disaster)
Most and Achi.

524
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,200
(If the captain has left the boat, what about us)

525
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Get some rest.

526
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,088
Both of them.

527
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,760
There will be one person.

528
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,320
Who got the highest votes for this week...

529
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,822
and another person who got the lowest votes.

530
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,720
The show would like to give special award, The Best fighter.

531
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,840
To Peek for this week.

532
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,200
What kind of person I am, I don't even know.

533
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,822
Thank you.

534
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,120
(Pushing Most Peek so much, why don't they just do Most Peek highlight)
(Can't do that because they didn't do acting together) Hello.

535
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,240
When I was watching Peek, I can only say...

536
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,336
(Peek played very real, less but more. Simple but good)
(The upper comment, please go
back to your Achi FC)
this boy will be a successful actor in the future.

537
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,160
Kla is also...
Let's just say you did well.

538
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,936
(The judge is commenting bias)
(Locking like this is so obvious, why don't you just give it to Peek then)
His match with Peek is good.

539
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,520
Umm.

540
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,056
(I feel really bad for Kla)
(The question, they want him to answer Most)
Coming back to Peek.

541
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,280
Everything that you did...

542
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,920
What is it you are fighting for?

543
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:31,760
(I feel bad for Kla. He's like a prop)
I am doing for my FC.

544
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:32,911
For everyone.

545
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,444
And most importantly.

546
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm doing everything for my family.

547
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,760
So impressed.

548
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,866
(For family, I'm crying I'm happy
that Kla isn't showing any disappointment)
He deserves to be the Best Fighter.

549
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:52,050
(They've been taking care of each other
since university, Kla knows it Still hoping)
Let them go and rest for a bit.

550
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,680
Thank you so much.

551
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,280
Well, now is the time.

552
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:11,200
To close the vote.

553
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
And here are the voting scores.

554
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,911
Hey.

555
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:22,160
So close.

556
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:25,520
We will open the voting again.

557
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:29,955
After everyone has passed the question answer round.

558
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:32,160
Right now, please allow us to pause the votes.

559
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,600
Let's watch something interesting.

560
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:41,520
Yeah.

561
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:42,666
Did you see just now.

562
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,120
We already got a couple FC.

563
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,880
Yeah, right.

564
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,733
Its like we already won.

565
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,266
Wait, not yet.

566
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:50,822
We still have the answering round.

567
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:52,133
What are you planning to say?

568
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I don't know.

569
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,320
Just going to answer honestly.

570
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:57,866
And you?

571
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't need to win.

572
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,720
Because I already got you as my prize.

573
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:06,520
Stop it.

574
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:07,711
So cheesy.

575
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,622
You shy?

576
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,266
Most, Listen to me.

577
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,977
We worked very hard since the beginning.

578
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,666
If you answer the question and say something about me.

579
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:39,200
The show won't be too mean to split us and let Peek win.

580
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:42,088
Don't allow the show to do it.

581
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,000
What are you stressed about?

582
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,355
You are leading.

583
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,222
Or you stressed because
your dad isn't here to cheer you?

584
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:15,600
If the winner from P' Team, is not Kla.

585
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:18,400
I want you to distance yourself from him.

586
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,400
For me.

587
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,440
Well.

588
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,600
Coming to the question answer round.

589
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,044
The question is...

590
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,066
in your opinion,

591
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:40,160
what are the qualifications of an Idol?

592
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:45,120
And are you ready to be Y Idol?

593
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,880
Each one of you will have 1 minute.

594
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,311
Your time starts now.

595
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:55,080
Thank you for the question.

596
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,000
For me,

597
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:01,266
Idol is someone...

598
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:02,866
who has to have talent.

599
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,222
I'm not talented.

600
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm not outstanding.

601
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:10,333
But I work really hard.

602
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:12,133
I never give up.

603
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,755
The show gives us missions every week.

604
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,533
To test our skills in singing, dancing and acting

605
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:22,377
I've never been at the bottom for any week.

606
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:24,644
I only think that...

607
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,333
I have to do my best.

608
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,711
I don't want to compete with anyone.

609
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,520
I am only a person who loves acting.

610
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:35,844
No matter what the role is,

611
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:37,622
I will do my best.

612
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,280
That is my proof
that I can do well in everything.

613
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:44,733
And I deserve to be Y Idol.

614
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,888
If not me.

615
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:51,200
I am just ordinary boy from outskirts.

616
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:53,920
I came into Bangkok to form my own band.

617
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:57,120
I go here and there singing in pubs.

618
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
Today I have so many people that love me.

619
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,066
I am very happy.

620
00:38:04,422 --> 00:38:05,640
I am not good looking.

621
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,280
My age is also a lot.

622
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,240
But if I have determination.

623
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:11,520
I can do it.

624
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:13,840
I'm doing it for my family.

625
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,520
That's all I want.

626
00:38:15,888 --> 00:38:20,000
I will be even happier
if more people love me.

627
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Being Y Idol.

628
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:26,800
Being inspiration for everyone who has a dream.

629
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,177
No matter if the role is big or small.

630
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,688
You just need to do your best.

631
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,711
Never stop learning.

632
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,600
Never stop developing.

633
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,600
And this is what I've been doing the whole time.

634
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,720
If being an Idol for everyone here.

635
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:52,720
Means being able to overcome obstacles.

636
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:53,822
Honest.

637
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,866
Sincere.

638
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,280
And being yourself.

639
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,733
Then I can not be your Idol.

640
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,816
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Boss, are you watching, the heck!!!)
(Boss: I am. I'm crying. He's so brave to answer like that.
He's obviously rebelling the show)

641
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,440
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Aom: But I trust the viewers. He will definitely win right?)
(Boss: Aom, he didn't answer as per script.
They already know they can not control him so they won't let him win)

642
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,020
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Bank: Honestly, Peek is so blinded with Kla.
He's giving up title for a guy. How dumb)
(Boss: He's actually very smart, Bank)

643
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,600
(Three Temptress without Pond)
(Boss: People know now Peek was supposed to win this
and yet he gave up the crown.
In the end, the's the real winner in their eyes.)

644
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:22,920
(Next Break)
Then I can not be your Idol.

645
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,640
Before announcing the winner
Why didn't you show the results on the screen like the last round?

646
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,333
Yes, why?

647
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,160
This is a competition.

648
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,888
Even not locking the winner feels like locking.

649
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:38,520
There are so many ways.

650
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,520
For them to get the people they want.

651
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,444
Am I ready to be Y Idol?

652
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:06,320
I think it depends on
who you want to be an idol for.

653
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:12,920
If being an Idol for everyone here
means being able to overcome obstacles.

654
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,440
Honest.

655
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:15,200
Sincere.

656
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:16,840
And being yourself.

657
00:40:18,444 --> 00:40:20,200
Then I can not be your Idol.

658
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:36,560
I can not be your idol...

659
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,960
Because all that I said just now

660
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:41,533
I don't have any of those qualifications.

661
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,640
I can not overcome obstacles.

662
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,911
Everyone needs to come and give me encouragement.

663
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,644
Thank you Kla and Earth very much for helping me

664
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,044
I've given troubles to everyone.

665
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,377
We fought.

666
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:01,840
I'm sorry Korn, Most, and Achi.

667
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:08,288
This moment

668
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:09,466
I already know.

669
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,666
How is an Idol supposed to be.

670
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,440
What are the qualifications.

671
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,422
But I admit.

672
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,577
Today, I can not do it.

673
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:22,266
I think...

674
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,280
Being able to accept myself today
I am already my own idol.

675
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,444
Aren't you stressed at all?

676
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:38,960
It's a competition.

677
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,822
Even not locking the winner feels like locking.

678
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:45,480
There are so many ways.

679
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:48,266
For them to get the people they want.

680
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:55,822
Hey.

681
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:58,377
Why stress.

682
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:00,422
Don't be.

683
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:03,844
Just do your best today.

684
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:10,040
But you know that they are trying to
push me and Most to win.

685
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,200
If that happens, what will you do?

686
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:15,280
There isn't just this show.

687
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,222
And what can we do.

688
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,720
Other than do our best.

689
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:25,222
I feel...

690
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,840
If the viewers can see our talent,

691
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,666
There will be more opportunities.

692
00:42:38,577 --> 00:42:39,244
Yeah.

693
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,600
I am a slow learner.

694
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:17,280
Please give me some time.

695
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:28,400
That's it.

696
00:43:28,511 --> 00:43:29,720
The love.

697
00:43:29,822 --> 00:43:30,733
Bonding.

698
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,320
That they sacrificed with their sweat.

699
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:34,760
And tears.

700
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:38,800
With determination and hard work.

701
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,520
Building this beautiful friendship.

702
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:45,200
Ofcourse, their journey.

703
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:49,080
They have come through a long way.

704
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,200
There were some fights.

705
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:52,240
Happiness.

706
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,066
Sadness.

707
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,320
But in the end what they get is not the prize.

708
00:43:56,755 --> 00:43:59,080
It's the friendship.

709
00:43:59,488 --> 00:44:01,644
A round of applause for all our Y Idols.

710
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,760
We now have the winners
Who is the Y Idol that will sign the contract and be the main leads.

711
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,720
On TTV's first Y series.

712
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,400
(Most and Achi takes millions!
Sign contract as TTV's first Y series main leads)
They are, Most and Achi.

713
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:29,240
Let's hear from them.

714
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:30,680
Well...

715
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,600
Honestly, I am very happy
and proud to have achieved my dream.

716
00:44:35,977 --> 00:44:39,880
And winning together
with Achi is even better.

717
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:41,577
Right Achi?

718
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:42,755
Yes.

719
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:45,320
I am very happy.

720
00:44:46,177 --> 00:44:49,400
Finally our hardwork has paid off.

721
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:51,777
Now we will be together for a long time.

722
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:56,080
Please wait to watch our series too.

723
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:56,911
Yes.

724
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:01,880
And K.Pond, will you be producing
this series by yourself.

725
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:06,360
For the director and production team
It will be another team taking care

726
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:08,840
I've already spoken to them.

727
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:10,680
Everyone will definitely like it.

728
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:12,120
Sorry.

729
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:13,520
I have a question.

730
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:18,311
Before announcing the winner, Why didn't you show the results
on the screen like the last round.

731
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:19,960
Yes, I agree.

732
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:22,111
Before closing the first round of votes.

733
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,680
Peek's vote was the highest.

734
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:28,000
And viewers loved his answer.

735
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,720
What happened there?

736
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,440
Yes, we want to know.

737
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:35,720
- What happened?
- Let me take a photo.

738
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:38,088
Photo time. Let's take photo.

739
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:40,377
Come, come, come.
Let's take photos.

740
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:42,680
No answer.

741
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,560
Camera. Which camera.

742
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:46,066
Please.

743
00:46:00,244 --> 00:46:01,520
I'm sorry mom.

744
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:04,480
I didn't come back with the prize money.

745
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:09,022
Hey.

746
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,955
Its okay.

747
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:14,555
You have already.

748
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:16,640
Won my heart over.

749
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:23,680
Have you eaten anything?

750
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:24,711
Are you hungry?

751
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:26,844
Here, here, here.

752
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:28,155
Eat this.

753
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:52,120
Did you put a whole bottle of shrimp paste?

754
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:55,933
See.

755
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:58,840
I explained to him so clearly.

756
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:00,066
But...

757
00:47:00,644 --> 00:47:02,360
Teacher Sakda had to make a mistake.

758
00:47:03,266 --> 00:47:04,044
Hello.

759
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,022
Aed.

760
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,733
Well, the ingredients for...

761
00:47:11,422 --> 00:47:14,120
lotus root soup. Do we still have it?

762
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:16,777
Nothing, nothing

763
00:47:16,955 --> 00:47:18,111
I don't want to have it.

764
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:20,333
Yeah.

765
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,866
How do you make it?

766
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:23,177
Is it hard?

767
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,720
Can you teach me?

768
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,044
Your dad understands you.

769
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:38,355
Understand but doesn't accept, right?

770
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:39,844
That's why he didn't come.

771
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,920
Give him some time.

772
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:53,280
Your dad is a slow learner too.

773
00:47:55,711 --> 00:47:59,844
He isn't ready to accept today.

774
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,022
Look at this.

775
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,120
Crying like a baby.

776
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,933
You never change.

777
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:26,866
Keep it first.

778
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,644
Here.

779
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,400
Put it in here.

780
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,533
I will keep it for you.

781
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Never mind.

782
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:34,977
It's okay.

783
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:37,520
Mom, I'm not going to eat it.

784
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:38,777
I'm going to hold it for you.

785
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:40,600
Please.

786
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:43,960
- Give it to me.
- Leave some for him too.

787
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,800
Yes, yes.

788
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:48,955
I'm not going to eat it.

789
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

790
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,360
Toon.

791
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:02,120
Why are you crying?

792
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:05,044
How many more tears do I have to wipe tonight?

793
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:07,466
Forget this show.

794
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:10,400
Our kids have done their best
People will notice them.

795
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
Oye.

796
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:17,466
I'm really sorry.

797
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,440
That I can't do as promised.

798
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:24,555
But I can't win alone without Kla.

799
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:31,280
It's not like that. I didn't mean like that.
I'm crying because I'm touched.

800
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:34,600
Thank you for caring about us.

801
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,600
- I am so happy. I'm very happy.
- Okay.

802
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Okay. Let's go keep your things. Go.

803
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,711
Let's go celebrate
Let's celebrate.

804
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:45,711
Peek.

805
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:55,520
I'm so happy.

806
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:58,177
See.

807
00:49:58,733 --> 00:49:59,577
Their chemistry is good.

808
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,880
No. Not them.

809
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:03,840
You and him.

810
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:05,200
Mother and son.

811
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,022
Do you want one more.

812
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Umm.

813
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:12,800
Take one more.

814
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:16,911
Peek.

815
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:21,040
You said that you would
show me the clip after its aired.

816
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,044
What clip?

817
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:32,622
Here.

818
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:36,288
I'm not answering because we are shipped.

819
00:50:36,822 --> 00:50:37,866
I want Peek to win.

820
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:40,133
He's very determined.

821
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:44,720
He may not be the best,
but he's trying very hard to do well.

822
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:46,177
Since university.

823
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:48,440
Until we became a shipped couple

824
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:51,000
I've always seen his cute side.

825
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,622
Where's yours?

826
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:02,920
I want Kla to win.

827
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,640
Because he's the best in the house.

828
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:08,720
He never stops developing himself.

829
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,333
And always spreading his talent with others.

830
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,560
And he keeps teaching me.

831
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:17,960
Without realizing...

832
00:51:20,088 --> 00:51:22,080
He has become my safe zone.

833
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:27,600
Safe zone?

834
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:33,622
Yeah.

835
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,266
And...

836
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:38,444
What next after this?

837
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,422
I don't know.

838
00:51:46,422 --> 00:51:47,977
Can we take it slowly?

839
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:50,733
I want to be more sure.

840
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:56,022
What are you saying?

841
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:58,377
I mean about work.

842
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:01,866
Oh.

843
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,680
How dumb of me.

844
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:25,400
So...

845
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:27,480
are you sure now?

846
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,400
So I can talk about work.

847
00:52:31,888 --> 00:52:32,511
Huh.

848
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:35,200
Wait.

849
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,000
Can we do one more time?

850
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,760
I want to do it better.

851
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:41,733
Please.

852
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,800
I can do this all day.

853
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,266
Yes, Toon.

854
00:53:14,466 --> 00:53:15,088
What!

855
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:17,160
Which agency?

856
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:20,960
Really?

857
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,333
Hey.

858
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:30,111
Is this true?

859
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:32,560
Is she messing with us?

860
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,900
(Ruamdao Bagkok: Congratulations Kla and Peek
for signing contract with Ruamdao Bangkok.)
I may not have been ready.

861
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,511
(Ruamdao Bagkok: This is the reward for hardwork.
Thank you everyone who have supported them.
Please continue supporting them. PS. New series coming soon)

862
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:36,560
To be everyone's idol today.

863
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:38,666
But tomorrow.

864
00:53:39,155 --> 00:53:40,377
You never know.

865
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:45,888
(Next Week)
And here are our actors from TTV.

866
00:53:45,955 --> 00:53:47,560
Keep all the documents ready.

867
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,222
Why do they not allow us
to have a partner?

868
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:51,960
If so... why don't we partner up?

869
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:53,111
Most, believe me.

870
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,733
Let it only be acting.

871
00:53:54,822 --> 00:53:56,400
Y couples.

872
00:53:56,511 --> 00:53:58,088
Do you have to be sweet off screen as well.

873
00:53:58,088 --> 00:53:59,755
Shippers are going to get heart attacks.

874
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:03,222
Has anyone ever told you
that you are cute?

875
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:04,466
Wait and watch.

876
00:54:04,977 --> 00:54:06,800
I don't want anyone to break the contract
