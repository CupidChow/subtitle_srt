- Not right?

170

to sell myself like this.

don't call anyone by the wrong name.

175
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,355
It's a big deal.

I know.

177

Please see my back.

178

Is it okay?

(Today at 9 sharp.
We’ll hear the truth.)

180

The news these days is weird.

181

Yes.

185

If so, take it off.

186

187

Hey.

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,644
Did you say that if I could get you in,

189
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,333
you won't blackmail me?

190
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,511
I didn't do it.

191
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,400
If you didn't do it, then who?

192
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,444
Hello, I'm Pan.

193
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,480
The people in the VDO that
many people are talking about right now.

194
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,066
You may wonder.

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
[Pan Thanamin clears up hot mess]
that in the clip and on TV, I look very different.

196
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,400
I admit that that was not me.

197
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,222
And today I'm going to stop faking.

198
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,066
Well, it has to be like this.

199
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,555
That I acted all cute

200
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,311
and sweet,
because I think everyone will like it.

201
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,088
But the real me,

202
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,111
it was as you can see in the clip.

203
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,444
I'm an angry person.

204
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,733
But I never had any malicious thoughts
toward anyone.

205
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,911
The only one who thinks badly toward others

206
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:13,426
is P'Koon.

207
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,244
These papers

208
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,200
have a list of executives, famous politicians
and businessmen that.

209
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,488
P'Koon took me to.

210
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,151
Telling me that it was a tour to channel.

211
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,577
Auditions.

212
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,711
But the fact it’s like this.

213
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,533
She took me to entertain people at dinner.

214
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,355
Without my consent.

215
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:42,200
And I never received a single baht.

216
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,911
From the evidence I've gathered so far,

217
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,859
the damage was more than 3 million baht.

218
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,420
Madam, something big happened.

219
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,694
The reason I am saying this,

220
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,311
I have no intention of hurting any family

221
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,234
because in my head it's only about work.

222
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,377
Even though I've devoted myself to work,

223
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,822
she still say I'm not right for big channels

224
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,727
and turned to support another actor instead.

225
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,800
Because that actor consistently find
college students for my former manager.

226
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,770
To her bed.

227
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,733
From all I've said,
you can choose to believe it or not.

228
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,688
I believe that people nowadays are smart

229
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,842
and if someone.

230
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,755
Or you know someone who got hurt from this,

231
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,377
I want to you show yourself

232
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,177
or if you are afraid, contact me.

233
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,622
I'll take you to police.

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,777
Thank you.

235
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,311
Very good, Pan.

236
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,759

We must thank you

247
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,866
that made it possible to collect
evidence on the auditioning.

248
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,711
I promise you, besides my kids,

249
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,377
if a victim contacts us,

250
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,755
I will help you sue Koon and Pharaoh.

251

If there are more victims,

tell me and P'Sai.

254

And you...

257

You don't have to think too much.

258
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,511
Start a new life well

259

you can stay at my condo.

if you hate the show that much.)

watch the event. I hate the production team.)

Everyone! We got a problem.

00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:31,622
What?

476
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,244
P called.

477
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,822
- P'P?
- Yes.

478
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,422
Nong P.

479
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,050
Hello, P'P.

480
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:49,850
Hello. Gus, Bew.

481
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:52,260
Congratulations to you.

482
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,333
- You're too kind.
- Yes, bro.

483
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,666
Can I take a screen shot for IG.

484
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,140
Sure, P'P.

485
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:05,622
1 2 3.

486
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:08,733
I'll tag you.

487
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,330
[You've been tagged by PPwang]

488
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,220
Did he really tag me?

489
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,430
I'll tell my mom.

490
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,590
Uh, where's Nott?

491
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:30,533
Nott? Let's go, he's there.

492
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,511
- Hi. Hello,
- P'P.

493
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,760
Congratulations on the a contract with TTV.

494
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:44,488
And I'm sorry about Pan.

495
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:48,850
Why are you sorry? He's not dead.

496
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:54,510
A talented person like him
won't go away easily. He'll be back soon.

497
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,822
I'll wait and see that day.

498
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:57,755
Yes.

499
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:09,260
Take it easy. Are you drunk or what?

500
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:15,430
If I'm drunk, I curse even more.

501
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:23,600
Actually, it's unfortunate that
Koon and Pan didn't get to come to this event.

502
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:28,140
Because they are a part
that made this series a success.

503
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:34,930
Can I ask you the truth?

504
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:38,733
Do you have something to hide from me?

505
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:45,850
Nothing to hide, only things that don't need to be told.

506
00:27:57,022 --> 00:28:00,720
Like the things that you sold ​​my stories?

507
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,177
Have you sent the news to the page yet?

508
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:13,470
Oh, what is it? The kids were just arguing.

509
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,640
This is how news is made.

510
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,640
If we can make journalists go to events

511
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:22,600
PR would give us an additional 30%.

512
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:25,000
I brought a souvenir for you.

513
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:29,850
Is it true that you two fought so hard
that the crew have to stop?

514
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:42,100
Tell me. Don't you feel sorry for him?

515
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:44,288
What did he do to you?

516
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:52,800
Feel sorry?
I don't think anyone is pity for my sorry.

517
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:58,680
I just thought that if we invest on anything,
we must get something back.

518
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:11,088
Oh, don't look at me like that.
For Nott...

519
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:16,760
You are perfect.
I don't have to invest anything on you.

520
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:21,022
Let's think of us as partners.

521
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:35,140
In fact, P'Koon, she loves Pan.

522
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:42,022
The person who is a manager.
She created someone, she had to love that person naturally.

523
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:08,220
Oh, cheers.

524
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:13,050
In the end, he was right about everything.

525
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:20,050
Here, they just need someone to be on their side.
One day it might not be me.

526
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,933
(- Nott Pachanon Damrongpol.

(Bew Bannawich Kedubol)

529
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,266
Why do you do this?

530
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,890
Why do you lie to me?

531
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:36,111
Do it, Toh.

532
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,760
If it makes you feel better, do it.

533
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:54,355
Do it.

534
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,022
Toh.

535
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:07,488
Do it.

536
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:31,800
Why?

537
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,550
Why does it have to be you?

538
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,066
Why do you have to be mean to me?

539
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:46,311
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:24,933
So good.

541
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,511
Very good.

542
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,422
I like when you cry.

543
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:37,133
It's connecting with the next scene that Toh

544
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,111
will agree to be arrested
by the police instead of Nuer.

545
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,990
I can assure you that the audience
all over the country will cry.

546
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,266
You're gonna really end it like this?

547
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,866
The audience will be all dead.

548
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,755
Well, it ends like this.

549
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:49,970
Make it a legend.

550
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:52,044
Because

551
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,010
we don't have a sequel anyway.

552
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:03,533
Nott, TTV will talk to you about a drama.
Tomorrow, we have to go in.

553
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,550
It's a pleasure to work with everyone.

554
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:10,850
Thank you very much.

555
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:17,533
Well, Nott-Nott,
I'm going to get my hair done in the morning.

556
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:20,640
You have to wake up. Got it?

557
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,220
Good luck the two of you.
Hope we have a chance to work together again.

558
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:43,977
Thank you bro.

559
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,933
Thank you very much.

560
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,333
I'll see you next time.

561
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,800
OK.

562
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:55,022
Good luck.

563
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:56,850
Thank you very much.

Yes.

Good bye.

571
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:13,466
Thank you very much.

572
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:20,680
Thank you for being a good partner of mine all along.

573
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,311
You..

574
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,220
You are the best partner for me.

(Song: Pan.
I went back to search the room.)

576
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
(Song: I think you should read this.)

577
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,533
(Song: She didn’t exactly ditch us.)

578
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,644
(Pan: She probably did it
out of guilt.)

579
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,640
(Song: You’re right, but…)

580
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
(Pan: Thanks anyways.)

581
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,488
(Pan: Do you want your reward for this?)

582
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,130
(Song: Stop it. I told you about it
because of our friendship.)

583
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,377
(Song: And stop offering yourself to
just anybody! Otherwise, I’ll punish you!)

(Koon: Can you get us an ice maker?)

585

he has some ice to chew on. Please?)

(Mod: I’ll make sure he gets his ice.)

587

(Next Break)
I want to compensate for everything.

588
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:06,333
I can take it if it makes you feel comfortable

589
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,040
but don't expect me to forgive
or go back to the way it was

590
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,711
because the old me is no longer here.

591
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,415
I'm giving you a blessing.

I really want to eat Lod Chong at that stall.

594
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,870
It's delicious.

595
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,133
Will eat at the next market, then.

596
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,666
Hey, who's on the ads?

597
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,990
Looks familiar.

598
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:03,450
Oh, is it Pharaoh?

599
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:04,660
The scandalous one?

600
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:05,888
Oh.

601
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,840
He was scolded by Live people at that time,

602
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,244
now he is on JJTV channel.

603
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,133
Oh, what a sin.

604
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,622
- Yes!
- Suit each other.

605
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:15,310
That channel is full of scandalous people.

606
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,334
I think so too.

607
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,740
Let's go to the next market.

608
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,222
Hey.

609
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:21,555
Is that Pan?

610
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,542
Yes! Let's go ask for a photo?

611
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:26,999
- Uh, Nong Pan?
- Yes?

612
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,933
Would you mind taking a picture with us?

613
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:31,800
Come here.

614
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,133
Alright, let's take a photo. Smile.

615
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,911
Make it handsome and cute.

616
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,088
1 2 3.

617
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:41,250
So cool.

618
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:44,120
So cute.

619
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:46,870
When you're not selling cuteness,
you're so handsome.

620
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:50,830
- Thank you!
- As handsome as how beautiful I am.

621
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,209
Well, I'll go now.

622
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:52,711
Yes.

623
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:53,333
Thank you.

624
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,710
- Yes, see you.
- Now my Lod Chong is delicious.

625
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,790
Why did you come?

626
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:38,310
Well, I was around the neighborhood.

627
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,911
There was a shooting.

628
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,422
So I came.

629
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:43,866
You doing alright?

630
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,688
Yes.

631
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:53,830
Actually, I want to apologize.

632
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:57,244
You're right

633
00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:00,955
that I have everything today

634
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,288
it's because you have been working so hard.

635
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:15,800
I want to compensate for everything.

636
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,444
It might not be a lot of money.

637
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,866
But I really want you to have it.

638
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,444
I can take it.

639
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:37,190
If it makes you feel comfortable

640
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,733
but don't expect me to forgive
or go back to the way it was

641
00:42:42,888 --> 00:42:44,580
because the old me is no longer here.

642
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:51,800
OK.

643
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,400
It's okay.

644
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:56,888
I have done my part.

645
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:01,955
I want to thank and apologize for my part as well.

646
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:04,200
If I ever caused you any trouble.

647
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:06,120
But after this,

648
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:09,688
it's better we go separate ways.

649
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:45,244
When action,

650
00:43:45,311 --> 00:43:47,822
Tar and Poh walk in and see him crying,

651
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,750
So you walk to him.

652
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:51,760
Then, you sit down and ask what's wrong.

653
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:52,888
What's up.

654
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:54,622
Never mind.

655
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:56,918
Then.

656
00:43:58,311 --> 00:43:59,620
Never mind so let's go.

657
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:01,888
- Come up.
- And, wait!

658
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:04,999
Get up.

659
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:06,955
Get up and

660
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,244
can I have a kiss please?

661
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:13,080
Wow. Really?

662
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:18,410
Palm, this is not the era that
someone has to sit and wait like an idiot.

663
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:19,933
We have to start.

664
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:23,120
Pan, your cue to come in.

665
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:24,866
Run in from over there.

666
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:26,333
Stop them. What are you doing?

667
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,288
What are you doing?

668
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:28,955
Run away.

669
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:30,666
As soon as it's done,

670
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:33,911
ask him,

671
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:38,500
Teacher, I want to try what they did just now.

672
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:40,466
You walk out.

673
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:45,022
Ok. Like this.

674
00:44:45,288 --> 00:44:46,911
Let's shoot.

675
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,370
Children, watch PLAY BACK.

676
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,511
Oh, P'New.

677
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:59,377
I have errand to run, can I go?

678
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:03,066
Can I go with him?

679
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:05,110
I have an appointment as well.

680
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,555
What appointment are you having today?

681
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:08,044
We talked, no?

682
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:10,244
What's done is done.

683
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:17,111
Can you be here, Pan?

684
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:18,577
Yes.

685
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,288
Let's finish it.

686
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:22,888
So let's take it real.

687
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,466
What about me?

688
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:45,790
Happy birthday to you.

689
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,999
Happy birthday to you.

690
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,177
Happy birthday, Happy birthday.

691
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,040
Happy birthday to you.

692
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:00,555
Happy birthday to you.

693
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:02,333
Thank you.

694
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,577
Make a wish first.

695
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,733
Oh, can I do something first?

696
00:46:08,155 --> 00:46:08,666
Sure.

697
00:46:30,377 --> 00:46:35,088
I understand now that
being a new actor, an old actor

698
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:38,488
or being at the top is meaningless.

699
00:46:38,777 --> 00:46:41,022
If we are not in the place that really suits us.

700
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:47,755
Blow them!

701
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,622
Yay!

702
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:55,040
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday to you!

703
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:07,000
Whatever we thought was the end,
it's actually a new beginning.

704
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:13,200
In the world of actors, we can start over as many times as we want.
If someone still gives us love.

705
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,955
And it's really great when we have someone who loves us
even on the day we're not the cutest.

706
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:37,288
Do people tell you this a lot today?

707
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,488
Happy birthday to you!

708
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:43,870
Yes, lots.

709
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:51,466
So how about this word?

710
00:47:57,644 --> 00:47:59,733
0 1.

711
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:08,088
Now who will be the new or old partner?
I don't care anymore

712
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:10,955
because I found my happiness.

713
00:48:24,044 --> 00:48:26,822
(Next Week)
I could see that everyone was always by our side.

714
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:28,200
Support.

715
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:29,755
Cheer up.

716
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,850
It's so deep that I can't explain it.

717
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,333
Damn, Gus!

718
00:48:33,555 --> 00:48:35,711
There are no fans out there,
don't have to say this.

719
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,622
I got chills.

720
00:48:36,688 --> 00:48:38,955
They cheered for them to be real couples.

721
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,088
But when they come out as dating

722
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,711
they'll lose the attention.

723
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:44,777
Why can't you play?

724
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,466
We did lots of takes.

725
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:47,466
When

726
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,499
the teacher have
me think of the person that I love.

727
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,733
I see P'Gus's face.

728
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:54,890
Even though it wasn't intentional at all.
