Did you forget to log out, detective girl.

6
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,631
You can't run away anymore, Kitty.

(War Of Y)
(Episode 9)

8
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,520
We would like to announce postponing the concert

9
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,453
Gus Bew Scent of Love Live.

10
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:22,930
Until further notice.

11
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:24,129
What?

12
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:26,861
Now.

13
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,042
We would be moving forward, in our own paths.

14
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,219
But I will stll love.

15
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,936
And have good wishes for Bew always.

16
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:35,763
Same here, Gus.

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,472
You are my best partner.

18
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,606
We want to say sorry to all our FC.

19
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:51,500
And hope you would still support us.

20
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,880
When you say postpone, do you mean

21
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:55,766
cancelling it?

22
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,791
Saying like this.

23
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,361
Means you won't be working together anymore?

24
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,180
The rumours that your managers don't get along, is it true.

25
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:02,486
And Bew got hurt.

26
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:03,600
Is it true?

27
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,084
And between Gus and Bew.

28
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,760
- Are you guys fighting.
- Yes.

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,540
How is it?

30
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:08,897
Please answer.

31
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:32,760
Er, if no more questions.

32
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,358
Please excuse us.

33
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,193
Thank you. Please, please.

34
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,689
I told you to announce the separation.

35
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,261
But hugging each other like this.

36
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,200
They will make it look like,
you don't want to separate.

37
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:51,504
And you asked for this yourself.

38
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
Everyone knows.

39
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,638
We are separating because of you guys.

40
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,478
Ending like this is probably the best.

41
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,472
Goodluck sis.

42
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,203
Wait moms.

43
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,950
I think this won't end so easily.

44
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,242
I was very in with your relationship.

45
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:35,333
So much that I thought it was real.

46
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,260
And seeing all this.

47
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:43,144
It.

48
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:45,433
Feels like heartbroken.

49
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,386
And when I saw everything.

50
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,992
I feel like I was cheated.

51
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,133
Don't be annoyed.

52
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,040
Everyones helping.

53
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,020
Everyone wants it to come out the best.

54
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:06,952
- Oye.
- What the heck.

55
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,546
Ouch.

56
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:31,920
So I created this 'detective girl' account.

57
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,410
(Detective Girl's account)
(The ship has sunk, Bew doesn't want to work together.)

58
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,066
(Bye. Stop being fake)

59
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:53,742
But you know right.

60
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:56,468
Me and Toon.

61
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:59,368
Can sue you for millions.

62
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,233
I am sorry.

63
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:11,318
I am sorry.

64
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,408
Sorry.

65
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,440
Please don't sue me.

66
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:29,734
To be honest.

67
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,846
Someone paid me to do it.

68
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,533
Here

69
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,211
(@Looney1988: Upload this clip tomorrow afternoon.
I want out.)

70
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,404
(I'll pay you 20,000 baht,
give me your bank details.)

71
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,428
Looney.

72
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,720
Whose account is this.

73
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:21,098
I've captured this before.

74
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,803
When she forgot to switch the accounts.

75
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,570
(@Looney1988: I have news today.
Guess who's starring in the series Mafia Baby Season 2)

76
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:41,056
Toon.

77
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:45,986
You wanted to discredit Gus, I got that.

78
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,873
But this is Bew.

79
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,865
Everyone saw him helping himself.

80
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,103
Don't you pity him.

81
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,400
I didn't do it.

82
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,906
What the heck do you mean by you didn't do.

83
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,227
Bew.

84
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:16,612
I really didn't do it.

85
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,173
This account
I haven't used it in a long time.

86
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Bew.

87
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,051
Bew son.

88
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,171
Bew, Bew, Bew, Bew, Bew.

89
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,586
Bew, stop.

90
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,832
I really didn't do it.

91
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,055
When you call me son.

92
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:56,089
Have you ever meant it.

93
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,165
These things can get hacked.

94
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:07,793
I promise I didn't do it.

95
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,818
Then who would hack.

96
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,920
♪ The clock ♪

97
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,903
The only person who knew that you have that account.

98
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:19,717
♪ Till the last day ♪

99
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,741
Is me.

100
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,720
♪ The love that has to come to an end ♪

101
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,043
Or you think I was the one to hack.

102
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,887
And I paid Kitty.

103
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,037
To spread this clip viral.

104
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,196
And did you really do it?

105
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:55,798
Can you stop it.

106
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,866
Please stop throwing drama at me.

107
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,687
Im tired.

108
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:13,835
Bew.

109
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
Breathe, slowly.

110
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:15,885
Bew, calm down.

111
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,503
Calm down.

112
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,092
Bew.

113
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:29,593
Bew, are you okay?

114
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:31,446
Clear among yourselves.

115
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:32,726
- Wait.
- Stop.

116
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:35,575
Come back here.

117
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,982
About the party, we haven't cleared.

118
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,479
Why did you call Gus over.

119
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:43,342
I saw that you weren't drunk that night.

120
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,046
His house was in Rangsit.

121
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,765
By the time he came, I was sober.

122
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,106
Is it?

123
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:52,593
And is Toon involved?

124
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,280
I don't know.

125
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,079
Someone is doing drugs in there.

126
00:10:58,562 --> 00:10:59,960
If Gus gets in jail.

127
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,751
I don't know about it.

128
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:09,360
When it comes to things like this.

129
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,061
You think Toon is involved.

130
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,099
And if not.

131
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,714
Why did you resign.

132
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:19,160
Gus got me bashed up so hard.

133
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,530
Who would stay.

134
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,201
So I resigned over a month ago.

135
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,097
You can ask the extras.

136
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,458
You know.

137
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,762
If I find any evidence.

138
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,740
I will get you bankrupt.

139
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,109
Go ahead.

140
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,199
You won't find any.

141
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,706
Because me and Toon have no involvement.

142
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Sure.

143
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,126
And we will see.

144
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,068
P' Pla.

145
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,158
Please don't sue me.

146
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,866
I didn't think carefully.

147
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,111
Don't sue me.

148
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,028
P' Pla.

149
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:01,436
P' Pla.

150
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,740
(Call me back)

151
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:26,338
Don't you want to pick up the call?

152
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,233
Lets end this nicely Bew.

153
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,722
Just seeing her name, I feel like crying.

154
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I think.

155
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,452
She did a little too much.

156
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:43,838
I made the right choice.

157
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,475
By ending with her.

158
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:48,571
And.

159
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:49,939
Leaving at this time.

160
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,220
Won't the FC make it a big deal?

161
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,705
She did this herself, Gus.

162
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:01,377
Also.

163
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
If I say anything, it would look bad.

164
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:09,865
Anyhow.

165
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:13,186
I still see her as my mommy.

166
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,982
What decision are you going to take.

167
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,060

261

What.

264
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:23,668
What are you doing?

265
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:24,871

And recording it.

273
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,640
To try and get away from me right?

274
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:51,593
Then accept it.

275
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,148
That you cheated on that Top spender.

276
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,572
Yeah.

277
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:57,428
I used your money to pay.

278
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,279
But let me tell you.

279
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
If you get to play on TTV.

280
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,508
Stop acting crazy.

281

Stop being a crazy lover and go act.

282
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:11,334
You will get even more than that.

283
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,026
But all that you did.

284
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:16,769
It was cheating

Scared that I won't be able to stay in the industry.

295

Then let me go.

296

Then go.

297
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,129
Go away.

298

340
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,156
He can't do anything.

341
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:32,261
But you are smart.

342
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,372
For thinking of this plan.

343
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,302
You took my money to pay for top spender.

344
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,075
Yes, I took it.

345
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,348
Hmmm.

346
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,581
Smile.

347
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,461
We just did what we had to do.

348
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,328
Also.

349
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:01,273
In the clip, he said everything himself.

350
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,394
We didn't accuse him of anything
Understand?

351
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:06,325
Hmm.

352
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:07,878
Hmm.

353
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:09,473
Hmm.

354
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,289
I understand now.

355
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:26,781
When you said.

356
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,137
Feels like breaking up with them.

357
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
But we are the ones hurt.

358
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:34,228
Sometimes even more hurt.

359
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:39,908
Hmmm.

360
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,603
I am stressed too.

361
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,951
But everything will get better.

362
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:53,026
Umm.

363
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:12,145
Here.

364
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,374
Have a cookie.

365
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:16,439
Chocolate will make your mood better

366
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,270
want to have?

367
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,321
Eat eat.

368
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:30,963
Better?

369
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:40,647
No?

370
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,428
Not feleing better?

371
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:45,735
Hmmm.

372
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:50,193
Here.

373
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:52,413
It hurts.

374
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,041
Cause you arent stop sulking.

375
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:06,358
This is happy.

376
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,634
Wish the FC can see this scene.

377
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Not for long Gus.

378
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,154
(BewBew started a live video)

379
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,468
(Gus has already left Pla. Will you two get to work together?)

380
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:43,853
(When is your next event together?)
Gus has already left Pla.

381
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:45,311
(You've been through so much, you're more calm.)
Will you two get to work together?

382
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:46,855
(You can be a couple, but work separately.)
(Always supporting Bew and Gus.)

383
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:47,421
(#WantGusBewBackTogether)
This is.

384
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,021
(The tag above is good.
Lets trend it #WantGusBewBackTogether)

385
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:48,963
Depnds on the occassion.

386
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:49,615
(Do you see each other in real life?)

387
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,388
(Of course, they live together.)
But keep supporting us on our separate events.

388
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:54,412
(Have you seen Gus lately?)

389
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:55,734
And.

390
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:57,881
(I miss you. #GusBewLiveTogether)
Do you get to see Gus these days?

391
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:00,734
Well.

392
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,721
(What are you looking at?)
We are both busy these days.

393
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:04,342
(Hey. Don't tell me...)
(Screaming, is Gus here?)

394
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,950
Ah

395
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,571
I will come live again everyone.

396
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:10,787
See you again later.

397
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:12,069
Bye bye.

398
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,243
What games are they playing.

399
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:46,661
Damn, they are so bad.

400
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:48,774
Who wouldve thought.

401
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:50,818
That he would hide another phone.

402
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:53,944
Sis, did you see Bew's clip.

403
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,954
Before Gus only used to see his shadows.

404
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:59,461
These days they bring flowers to each others.

405
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,601
Hashtags are trending everyday.

406
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:06,954
Why are they still hiding.

407
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:09,951
Why else, sis.

408
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,463
To get work together.

409
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,332
When they comeback, it will be huge.

410
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,035
For this.

411
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:17,381
Don't tell me.

412
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,866
They have the same manager.

413
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:26,654
Different.

414
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,678
(Bew: Contact P' Ally
Gus: P' Lookgolf)

415
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:31,788
There must be something right?

416
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:33,628
What then.

417
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Lets find out?

418
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:35,874
Sis.

419
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,361
Let it go.

420
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,796
We did a lot to them.

421
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,763
If they want to take revenge, up to them.

422
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:42,837
Lets end it.

423
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:49,561
Toon.

424
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:53,062
Let me ask you.

425
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,099
What is it with you and Yo.

426
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:04,318
I know.

427
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,708
I said I will transfer more.

428
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,463
And don't call me again.

429
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,248
Who's making Bew this angry.

430
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:24,287
Who are you talking to?

431
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:38,348
Who.

432
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,502
My cousin.

433
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:44,590
He has some debts.

434
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:46,313
And calling to ask for money.

435
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:49,617
It's.

436
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:51,548
I can give him.

437
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:52,857
No problem.

438
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,099
But don't want him to get used to it.

439
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,763
Just like me.

440
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,859
I am so used to having you.

441
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:10,693
Right.

442
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:13,281
Should we do it once.

443
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:27,347
I swear sis.

444
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:29,577
I didn't do.

445
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,041
About Kitty too.

446
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,101
At first.

447
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:39,303
I thought it was you 100%.

448
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:41,774
But then it became red.

449
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:43,246
Huh.

450
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:44,506
So clear.

451
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,984
Crazy.

452
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:51,148
Let it be, lets not talk about it.

453
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Leave what.

454
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:56,414
Aren't you going to do anything.

455
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,168
Who said.

456
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,401
You also know.

457
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,761
I have my way.

458
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:05,707
Huh.

459
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:07,750
Let me show you.

460
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,590
Oye.

461
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,311
Hey look.

462
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,810
Handsome.

463
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,154
Hmm.

464
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,834
Good at singing and dancing.

465
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:29,178
Right.

466
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:30,452
This is Kla.

467
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:32,303
Your style.

468
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:32,811
Umm.

469
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,877
Good at singing and dancing.

470
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:36,228
All perfect.

471
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,850
Even better than Gus.

472
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,521
One more.

473
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:43,088
You killed my parents.

474
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,923
I will not leave you.

475
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,633
Hiyaaaa.

476
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:50,943
What role is he playing.

477
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:52,831
A stone?

478
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,591
So natural.

479
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
Hes stiff.

480
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:57,720
Sis.

481
00:34:58,256 --> 00:34:59,423
Don't bully.

482
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:00,827
Stop!

483
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,165
This is.

484
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:03,312
Peak.

485
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:04,930
Peak, as his name.

486
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,708
So cute. Handsome.

487
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,636
But when he does anything, it's disastorous.

488
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,734
He asked me to be his manager before.

489
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,234
But I swiped away.

490
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,666
Ow.

491
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,634
Then why do you want to be now.

492
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,375
Here.

493
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:22,954
Senior and junior of the business faculty.

494
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:24,757
Whenever they have an activity.

495
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:27,830
These two have FCs following them.

496
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:29,414
And even a fandom.

497
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:35,570
We can sell this ship at the university.

498
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:37,930
One is perfect in everything.

499
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,028
And another can go along.

500
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:41,541
When they are together.

501
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,498
Help each other.

502
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:43,693
Act cutely.

503
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:44,756
Hows it?

504
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:45,574
This plot.

505
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,061
Will it sell?

506
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:47,954
It will.

507
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:48,994
Work.

508
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:50,013
But not for this couple.

509
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,514
But you, are going to sell well.

510
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:52,668
For sure, what next?

511
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:54,821
You want to go sell fan fictions instead.

512
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,088
Sis, really.

513
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,441
You and me.

514
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,614
Can't deny.

515
00:35:59,500 --> 00:35:59,833
We.

516
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,521
Not matter how much we fight with each other.

517
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,269
We are made to work together.

518
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,561
We will make this ship.

519
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,641
Even better than Gus and Bew.

520
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:10,714
Deal?

521
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:11,894
Okay, deal.

522
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:17,688
(FC demads #WewantGusBewbacktogether
Trending no.1 without any events)

523
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:19,076
(Next Break)
What are you seeing?

524
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,494
Pla and Toon have new stars?

525
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,437
Hey, I want to watch a movie.

526
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,394
Can you go with me.

527
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,963
But I have some unfinished work.

528
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:29,481
Can you help me with it.

529
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
(Coffee or me?)

530
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,180
(Never before Khun Kasidet. Are you guys together?)

531
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,500
Too guick, Mr. Kasidet.

532
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,340
It will be exposed.

533
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,460
I want it to.

534
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Not yet.

535
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,056
Wait for a bit.

536
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,823
Let the FC miss us.

537
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,846
And we will go and talk to him next week.

538
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Huh.

539
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Umm.

540
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Do you think.

541
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,035
Will there be someday.

542
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,300
That we will be like this infront and behind the camera.

543
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,252
You also know.

544
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,958
No Y couple has come out publicly before.

545
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,660
Then why don't we be the first.

546
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,871
No risk, no fame.

547
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
You.

548
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,913
Are starting to talk like Pla.

549
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,483
You also talk like Toon.

550
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
What happened?

551
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
What are you thinking.

552
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,964
I don't know how she is?

553
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
I started missing her.

554
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,209
Good.

555
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,029
These days.

556
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,581
When you are stressed, you don't tear your nails anymore.

557
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,810
Who likes to stop me from doing.

558
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,569
Thank you Gus.

559
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,797
I am better because of you.

560
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,368
Taking chances.

561
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
I don't know.

562
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,556
I still want to work in the industry.

563
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,380
But like.

564
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,300
Does it have to be Y-industry.

565
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Umm.

566
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,030
Peak, do you know.

567
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,644
Kla?

568
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,820
I've heard from the university studetns that.

569
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,308
You two are shipped.

570
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,692
So me and my friends want to take this further

571
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,053
I think it will be a superhit couple.

572
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,762
Do you want to think about it?

573
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,281
You want me to be a couple, with Kla?

574
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Yes.

575
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,019
I heard that you don't have a lot of jobs these days.

576
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,616
You even had to drop out from university.

577
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
Toon.

578
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,785
Hmm.

579
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,097
Hello Toon.

580
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Oh, hello.

581
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,033
Hello.

582
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:01,260
Hi.

583
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,105
I

584
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Want to go watch a movie.

585
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,245
Can you go with me.

586
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,020
But I haven't finished my work.

587
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,810
Can you come help me.

588
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Okay.

589
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,250
I think.

590
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,620
It can be more relaxed.

591
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Let's try again.

592
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
One more time.

593
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,487
Here.

594
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Come, lets do it again.

595
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:33,566
I

596
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Want to go watch a movie.

597
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Can you go with me.

598
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,460
But I haven't finished my work.

599
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,220
Can you come help me first.

600
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,100
Just going along, right you?

601
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,340
But wanting to build them.

602
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
They are acting like.

603
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,340
Stones. How do we build them.

604
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Sis.

605
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
Come on.

606
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,940
Naive and innocent, thats cute.

607
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Let's try.

608
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Or.

609
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,420
Should I send them for personality building class too.

610
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
You should.

611
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
I saw a course.

612
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Sis.

613
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
Huh.

614
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,180
Look, look, look.

615
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,260
What?

616
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,540
(Y Idol: Time to get your dream!
Looking for cute boys to compete in reality show: YIDOL!)

617
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,820
Looking for new stars.

618
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Y-Idol looking for new Y actors.

619
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,260
For a new series on TTV.

620
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,851
Oh My God.

621
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,620
Time to shine again.

622
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,754
What are you looking at?

623
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,141
Keep them together in one house.

624
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,964
Learn singing and dancing.

625
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
And acting.

626
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,874
Voting every week.

627
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,780
Two winners will get to be the shipped couple.

628
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,057
Play in a big project on TTV.

629
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Will get famous.

630
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,420
This is just the opening and it's already on number one trend.

631
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
That's right!

632
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,671
Bringing all the boys together like this.

633
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,198
What will happen to the present ships.

634
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,940
(This is interesting! Always wanted my child to go on these shows)

635
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,940
(Chance is here. Anyone wanna pursue their dreams?)

636
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,580
Pla and Toon already have new stars?

637
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
Hello.

638
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Today?

639
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Sure.

640
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Yes.

641
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
See you.

642
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
Bye.

643
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
Whats wrong?

644
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
Gus.

645
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,980
It's time to meet our new manager.

646
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,868
(Kla is a young singer? I will definitely go cheer.)
(My dream is coming true. Kla and Peak on the same show.)

647
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,396
(Peak #YouKilledMyFather? He'll be dropped first.)

648
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,580
Not even in the industry yet and already bashed.

649
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,420
Can we not compete.

650
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,900
Don't stress.

651
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,020
These chances don't come often.

652
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
That's true.

653
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,500
And you don't even need to find jobs yourselves.

654
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,660
This show.

655
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,756
If you get a lot of votes, you can win.

656
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,162
And you already have FC's.

657
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,795
Hmm.

658
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,260
Right.

659
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,407
I will take you to learn dancing.

660
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:42,057
Train.

661
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,700
Singing.

662
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,020
Train anything that you want

663
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I promise.

664
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,460
Huh.

665
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:48,003
Be brave.

666
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,700
I will help you.

667
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,660
Sis, I am thirsty.

668
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,180
Yeah, me too.

669
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,540
Lets go.

670
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,300
At least they know each other.

671
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,180
Off screen chemistry is already good.

672
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,860
This is really good, sis. The rating of the show is good.

673
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,728
Trending number 1.

674
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,233
Cheers.

675
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,820
Hey.

676
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,100
We've dropped down the trend.

677
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
What?

678

681
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,075
Yeah

682
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,700
I don't feel comfortable working with anyone like Bew.

683
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,940
Coming back like this.

684
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,180
It's like a dream.

685
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,060
So sweet.

686
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,315
And.

687
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,740
We would like to thank everyone and our FC.

688
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,060
For calling us to comeback.

689
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,660
Especially with GusBew hashtag.

690
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,420
Trending everyday.

691
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,620
Even though we don't have any content at all.

692
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,420
To summarize.

693
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,009
You two separated because of your managers?

694
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
My dear.

695
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,900
For this question, let me reply.

696
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,260
Hello everyone.

697
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,300
Hello.

698
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,060
It's.

699
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,580
No matter what happened.

700
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,220
In the past.

701
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,260
But now

702
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
Gus and Bew.

703
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,780
Already has a new manager.

704
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,900
Who is just one person.

705
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,580
And I promise.

706
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,260
To take cre of Gus and Bew.

707
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,860
Not to let anything happen again.

708
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,940
P' Gong, is the new manager for both is them?

709
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,180
It's like slapping us hard right in the public. Damn.

710
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:03,940
Yeah.

711
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,260
Does concerts, events and.

712
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,420
Produces series and much more.

713
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,688
You left your managers long time back, but why opening new manager now?

714
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,060
Many people are assuming that.

715
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,660
You are purposely doing the opening today. To clash with Y Idol.

716
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,260
Why would we do that.

717
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,300
It is two different events.

718
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,660
The reason we are doing today is because we just got information from Gem TV.

719
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:27,940
Yes.

720
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,460
Well.

721
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,540
We are also going to have a series together.

722
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,700
And we are the main couple.

723
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:37,761
And.

724
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,900
The concert we decidede to postpone.

725
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,745
Will come back.

726
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,860
Touring all over Asia.

727
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,700
Please leave us your support.

728
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,380
Close. Please come closer.

729
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Damn.

730
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,580
This is worse than Koon and Can.

731
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Oh.

732
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,220
(GusBew Happy Ending. New manager.
Hope no more dramas like before)

733
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,820
Should we attack.

734
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,940
I want to sis.

735
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,780
But they were our kids.

736
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,020
But now they are now in someone else's care.

737
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,780
Does he ever pick the phone when you call?

738
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,020
Does he ever see you when you go to his events.

739
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,540
Does he ever say hi.

740
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,620
I know you love him.

741
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,860
But what I don't know is.

742
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
Does he still love you?

743
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,420
Trust me.

744
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Do what you can do.

745
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
It's time.

746
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,860
(K. Yo)

747
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,380
(Purposely blocked Kla Peak for sure.
#ManagersWarHasNotEnded)

748
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,220
Kla and Peak.

749
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
Are their new stars?

750
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,340
Huh.

751
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
Hmm.

752
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,618
(Evidence. The people who started the trend
that Gus and Bew are blocking Y Idol's are Pla and Cartoon)

753
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:54,716
(Have fun acting)

754
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
It's true.

755
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,180
What do we do?

756
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Gus and Bew.

757
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,020
Can do a live.

758
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,540
People will stop talking about it.

759
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,340
When you two.

760
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,780
Start having jobs coming in.

761
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,340
People will stop drama.

762
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,180
I have written this for you.

763
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
Read what I wrote. Come.

764
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,980
Hi.

765
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
Hi everyone.

766
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,740
Today.

767
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
We saw in the tag.

768
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,900
So we wanted to come and talk a little.

769
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,740
Yes.

770
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,060
Both of us.

771
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,940
Want to speak on behalf of our FC.

772
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,860
Please support all the couples.

773
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,300
Yes.

774
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,180
We are still friends and brothers.

775
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,540
Lets not fight and keep our Y community peaceful.

776
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,327
Yeah?

777
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,620
(My child is friendly to all, stop the drama)

778
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,140
Bew is so cute. Thank you

779

Gus.

780
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,660
Is getting closer to Bew again.

781
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,396
(How can we not trend. Look at the whale)

782
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,700
Here.

783
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
Always.

785
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,420
What did you comment?

786

(So fake! What brothers. Brothers don't steal
other people's scene) Don't you see their faces.

Everyone.

789
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,380
I don't want you to say anything.

790
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,900
To Pla or Toon.

Lets say

793

I request you.

794
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:45,379
Umm.

795
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,740
Yes.

796
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,900
They are.

797
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:49,876
Kinda.

798
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,580
Still has some respect.

799
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:53,193
Here.

800
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,300

801
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,780
What son?

802
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,854
Stop saying this word.

803
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,380
Hes saying all this because.

804
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,336
He wants to look good.

805
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,096
And we look like the bad ones.

806
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,140
Sis, you only.

807
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,420
The villian in the series.

808
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,220
Think of Peak and Kla.

809
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,580
Look at this.

810
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,102
Look.

811

(Treat Kla and Peak badly like you did Gus and Bew.
Those two will succeed for sure.)

Not yet.

814
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,194
The real war.

815
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,322
Is just about to start.

816
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,860
This is it. We will come and live again.

817
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,100
Yes. See you again.

818
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,460
Bye.

819
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,620
Very good.

When you left those two.

00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,375
Really good.

858
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:45,797
They can fake an email.

859
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,359
Change the dot to underscore.

860
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:50,206
Really good.

861
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:51,745
Making a issue go so big.

862
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,990
The best.

863
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:54,178
This was a long time ago.

864
00:54:54,682 --> 00:54:55,682
Why bring it up now.

865
00:54:57,515 --> 00:54:58,515
Seriously.

866
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,832
When you left them two.

867
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,939
What did you guys do.

868
00:55:03,683 --> 00:55:04,975
Why are they still after you.

869
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:13,312
They came this way.

870
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:15,446
We can't be still.

871
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:18,378
Is there something I need to know about

872
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,783
Gus?

873
00:55:24,245 --> 00:55:25,245
Bew?

874
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:46,995
Staying with P' Kong.

875
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,620
Hows it.

876
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:49,918
Is he taking good care of you?

877
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:56,288
Is it worth it.

878
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:57,341
To hurt us.

879
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:58,897
And hurt yourself.

880
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:02,253
You got me allergic and went to the hospital.

881
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:05,339
You hired detective girl.

882
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:07,396
You.

883
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:10,062
Planned everything to make Bew love me.

884
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,600
And cheated my money.

885
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:13,906
Where.

886
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,417
What did I do you.

887
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:17,858
Damn it Gus.

888
00:56:18,893 --> 00:56:20,225
Don't you know it yet.

889
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:21,218
Know what.

890
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,711
Tell me.

891
00:56:25,597 --> 00:56:27,012
Aren't you ashamed.

892
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,660
Why.

893
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,021
Don't I have the right to be angry.

894
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:34,205
The right to feel bad.

895
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:36,696
No right to take revenge.

896
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:41,026
We just wanted to go away from the stress.

897
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:44,092
We wanted to be happy.

898
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:48,966
Don't me and Gus have the right to be happy?

899
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:52,342
You want to play like this Bew?

900
00:56:54,389 --> 00:56:55,473
I will tell everyone.

901
00:56:56,118 --> 00:56:58,439
I will tell that I asked Gus to record Pla.

902
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:00,667
So he can leave Pla.

903
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,380
You happy?

904
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,032
Is it only that much Bew?

905
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:13,885
What more do you want.

906
00:57:14,412 --> 00:57:15,553
You want me to die?

907
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:21,286
Yes.

908
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:23,535
It will be good if I die.

909
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:27,703
Bew.

910
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,130
Bew, Bew, Bew.

911
00:57:29,288 --> 00:57:29,839
Bew.

912
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:30,466
Bew.

913
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:31,852
Bew, calm down.

914
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:32,901
No.

915
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:34,439
Let me just die.

916
00:57:35,024 --> 00:57:35,315
Bew.

917
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:36,044
Bew.

918
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:37,112
Calm down Bew.

919
00:57:37,136 --> 00:57:38,992
Calm down Bew.

920
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:40,234
Calm down.

921
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:41,342
Hey, hey, hey.

922
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,297
Get a packet, a packet.

923
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:46,522
Give it.

924
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,672
Enough.

925
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:51,586
Breathe breathe.

926
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:57,676
Pick him up.

927
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:58,218
Pick up.

928
00:57:58,439 --> 00:57:59,439
Pick.

929
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:16,853
Slowly breathe.

930
00:58:18,003 --> 00:58:19,251
Right now, both of you.

931
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:21,146
Are in the FC's light.

932
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:22,204
As the villian.

933
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:25,566
Whatever you say, no one will believe.

934
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:28,991
Weigh it yourselves.

935
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:31,779
Between just taking back.

936
00:58:32,002 --> 00:58:33,592
Is it worth what you have to pay.

937
00:58:37,108 --> 00:58:38,459
I won't expose P' Kong.

938
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,349
But the media are waiting for any answer.

939
00:58:42,669 --> 00:58:43,711
If you cancel now.

940
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:45,341
It will be suspicious.

941
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:47,675
How are you going to mend the situation.

942
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:56,005
Oye.

943
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:01,211
Oh.

944
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:02,648
Can you stop walking.

945
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:03,879
Im getting headache.

946
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:05,925
I am tensed.

947
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:06,742
Aren't you?

948
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:08,670
Don't know what they are going to say.

949
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:10,362
Look.

950
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:12,172
I don't know.

951
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:20,072
(Gus Bew's important press conference about previous managers)

952
00:59:20,075 --> 00:59:22,099
There have been rumours about us for a long time.

953
00:59:23,562 --> 00:59:25,437
But we haven't said anything.

954
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:28,027
Yes.

955
00:59:28,734 --> 00:59:29,734
Well.

956
00:59:30,689 --> 00:59:32,564
Our managers.

957
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:34,819
Didn't want us to say it so we felt uncomfortable.

958
00:59:35,274 --> 00:59:36,739
So we had to leave them.

959
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:41,366
We apologize to all our FC's.

960
00:59:41,549 --> 00:59:43,549
If we have disappointed you.

961
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:46,231
Or feel uncomfortable.

962
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:48,838
Well.

963
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:49,954
The truth is.

964
00:59:52,379 --> 00:59:53,379
Well.

965
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:04,265
We.

966
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:11,218
Are dating.

967
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:23,165
(Gus Bew's important press conference about previous managers)

968
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:24,165
Here is the document.

969
01:00:24,271 --> 01:00:26,938
We have compiled a list of Y actors.

970
01:00:28,123 --> 01:00:29,439
Who came to call out.

971
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:30,522
For equal marriage.

972
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:36,586
We didn't mean to hurt them.

973
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,426
But the war they had.

974
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:41,846
We just had to survive.

975
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,512
As Darwin's says.

976
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:56,899
Those who can adapt best.

977
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:00,225
Are the greatest.

978
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:06,339
Those two, haven't said anything.

979
01:01:08,212 --> 01:01:10,047
Maybe the news about us dating.

980
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:12,332
Has covered all the drama.

981
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,488
Bew.

982
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:34,045
Hmm.

983
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:41,809
Are you happy?

984
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:46,823
Happy.

985
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:50,108
Finally.

986
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:52,717
We can now be the same infront and behind the cameras.

987
01:01:53,893 --> 01:01:55,533
No need to act infront of anyone anymore.

988
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:18,159
(Unknown number)

989
01:02:18,894 --> 01:02:20,134
Sorry to trouble you this late.

990
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:22,544
But I can't take it anymore.

991
01:02:23,026 --> 01:02:24,466
I don't want to be involved anymore.

992
01:02:24,934 --> 01:02:26,894
Pla and Toon are pressuring me to tell the truth.

993
01:02:27,038 --> 01:02:28,122
Who is behind everything.

994
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:30,211
Otherwise they will sue.

995
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:41,970
Did you tell.

996
01:02:42,164 --> 01:02:43,164
It was me.

997
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,774
Those who can adapt the best.

998
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:48,052
Are the greatest.

999
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:50,919
And those who are greatest.

1000
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:53,779
Are the survivours.

1001
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,089
How much do you want?

1002
01:02:58,614 --> 01:02:59,614
Same.

1003
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:05,734
Done.

1004
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:09,112
Don't let anyone know.

1005
01:03:10,238 --> 01:03:11,238
Especially Gus.

1006
01:03:20,812 --> 01:03:25,352
(Not only did they open their relationship to the public
Gus and Bew calls for equal marriage)

1007
01:03:25,508 --> 01:03:26,508
Is your speech ready?

1008
01:03:26,729 --> 01:03:28,752
You will definitely win The Greatest Y.

1009
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:30,726
Can we talk some other day mom.

1010
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:31,935
Today I can't.

1011
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:33,577
Don't you think of telling him the truth

1012
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:34,669
I have evidence.

1013
01:03:35,117 --> 01:03:36,279
The sound in that clip.

1014
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:38,218
Doesn't say.

1015
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,245
What all am I behind.

1016
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:42,597
Why are you still standing like this.
Why aren't you saying anything.

1017
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:44,164
Because you want the award?

1018
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,072
Bew, you are behind everything?

1019
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,372
Like everyone's saying?

1020
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:49,219
No risk, no fame.

1021
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,680
It's entertainment industry
