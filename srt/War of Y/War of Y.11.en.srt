00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:21,137
Because you have projects in the industry.

318
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,006
That moment
I thought my chance was gone.

319
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,030
Huh?
Gone.

320
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:25,092
What does that mean

321
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,253
I tripped over Most.

322
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,160
If he didn't catch me

323
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,666
I would've gone.

324
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,373
Down the stage.

325
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,853
And to the bottom as well.

326
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:36,533
Oh well.

327
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,380
Oye.

328
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:41,506
No need to stare that much.

329
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,153
Here.

330
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:44,442
Please come here and stay together.

331
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,880
So you can look at each other.

332
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,033
Aa.

333
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,260
Peek.

334
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:52,346
Never mind.

335
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,610
Do better next week.

336
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:54,266
Fighting.

337
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:55,373
Not tensed right?

338
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:56,613
Not anymore.

339
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:56,960
Umm.

340
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,073
Got good support from everyone.

341
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:01,957
Everyone.

342
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,586
Many people or just the one.

343
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,633
Who.

344
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Is it this one.

345
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Well.

346
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Everyone.

347
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,808
Never mind.

348
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:18,300
I know

349
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,760
I can make out. I've seen a lot.

350
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:22,083
Umm Never mind. Don't be shy.

351
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,736
Well.

352
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,060
Hey! What, what, what
What is this.

353
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:29,113
- What is this.
- What.

354
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:33,066
How's it.

355
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,933
- Umm.
- Nothing.

356
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,273
Oh.

357
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,440
P' So.

358
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:37,946
Yes.

359
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,653
What do we have to do next?

360
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:42,213
We will have individual live.

361
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:43,767
But now first.

362
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:44,923
You get up first.

363
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,636
Let's stand.

364
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:47,526
Well.

365
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:48,093
Everyone.

366
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,117
Today.

367
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,093
Is very surprising.

368
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:53,733
Because I've got these
Equipments.

369
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,810
Electronics.

370
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Here.

371
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:57,633
For you all.

372
00:22:57,658 --> 00:22:58,658
Because in this camp.

373
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,126
You cannot talk to anyone.

374
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:03,069
(Rules of Waii Jai Y Idol: This week, our idols will receive a phone to talk to their FC through Y Live. Each idol will have 20 minutes to ask for votes from FC until end of the live. The Idol with highest viewers gets extra scores Ready... Set... Let's Go!!) Today, I will let you.

375

Here.

377
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,846
If you are ready.

378
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:08,906
You can start your live.

379
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,009
Individual live.

380
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:13,440
Let's Go.

381
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,761
(He's here)

382
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:24,786
Hello

383
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,133
I am Peek.

384
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,289
(The legend of the stone actor)
(Peek, are you feeling better now)

385
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,560
For this week

386
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,080
I was very excited.

387
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,150
To find out the mission.

388
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:34,380
(How did he pass the casting)

389
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,416
(Crazy people, if you don't like, don't watch)(Are you doing a live, or chanting?) Personally, I wanted it to be singing.

390
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,475
(You want to sing. You can't even speak in correct keys)(Peek, be more relaxed)(You are here to speak to FC, why are you chanting)

391
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,626
Peek, please be more relaxed.

392
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:44,443
Umm.

393
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,860
Don't I look relaxed?

394
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:46,835
(Rooting for you. Be chilled, don't be serious)
(If you are sleepy, got to bed)

395
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,966
I am very chilled now.

396
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,569
(What are you looking at. Script?)
(I feel bad for him. This is why he doesn't belong here)

397
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:58,573
I want to ask for support from everyone.

398
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:00,569
(Peek can you show us what others are doing)
(True, try talking to others if you are tensed talking alone)

399
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:03,580
(#Peekisinnocent, Go play with others)
Peek, can you show us what others are doing.

400
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:12,531
(Still again, so good at being still)
(Can you take us to Kla)

401
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,641
(Still again, so good at being still)
(Can you take us to Kla)

402
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,208
Hey Earth, you okay bro.

403

408
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,753
Wanna join me?

409

Never mind bro

410
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,346

414
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,635
(Why is he such a scardy cat)
Oh. Why did you get so surprised.

415
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,169
(Oh my country boy, how cute)

(He just spoke what I commented)
(So fake. Why are you speaking Esaan)

421
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,929
You got surprised with this?

422
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,116
Go go go.

423
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,104
(Stop faking with the Esaan, please)
(I am from Esaan. Give me a hug Korn)

(What's with 'come here')

475
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,466
Do I need to do everything for you.

476
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,246
Do what

477
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,633
I am confused what did you do.

478
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:10,056
Service.

479
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:12,626
To please your FC side.

480
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,693
Or.

481
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,928
Do you want to service them openly.

482
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,953
Not like that.

483
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,773
Acting like a teenage high school girl.

484
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:26,080
We already spoke to Pla and Toon.

485
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:27,266
That we won't service much.

486
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:31,786
But do you see what others are doing.

487
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,380
If we don't do
We won't get any airtime.

488
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
What the hells wrong with you.

489
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:07,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:08,896
Hey.

491
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:12,726
What are you doing.

492
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,100
Why are you putting it on.

493
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,840
- I see your bra.
- Hey.

494
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,473
- A little bit.
- Hey.

495
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,540
Come one, just a little.

496
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:26,946
You shy?

497
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:28,706
Are you?

498
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,106
Wrong room.

499
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,934
Aahh.

500
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,300
Don't know what the two boys are doing in there.

501
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Here.

502
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,191
(NC Compilation 'The Stars stories')(Y Fiction (Rate 20))(My first Y fiction. Image #KlaPeek)(Stars of the Business faculty)(New episode: In the bathroom)(♪Warning BDSM♪)

503
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,733
Kla's strong arms.

504
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:19,626
Pushed Peek and pinned him down to the floor.

505
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,120
I will make you mine.

506
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,880
Peek shivered.

507
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,320
He was scared.

508
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,413
Please don't.

509
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:31,573
Don't!

510
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,500
Kla continued to push himself on Peek.

511
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:44,846
Without slowing down.

512
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:47,720
The warmth filled in.

513
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:52,066
Peek was going to heaven
Happiness filling the room.

514
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,826
With little blood oozing.

515
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,403
I can't.

516
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Too much.

517
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,266
Faster.

518
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,610
Harder

519
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,846
I'm dying.

520
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:06,995
Hey. Wait.

521
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:08,853
Whats this? Where are you going?

522
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,260
We haven't finished talking.

523
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Nothing.

524
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,580
But you don't have to skinship with me.

525
00:31:16,296 --> 00:31:17,736
Don't forget what Pla and Toon said.

526
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:22,340
I didn't forget.

527
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,200
But the FC's like it.

528
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,924
Don't you forget.

529
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,310
You came here.

530
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:28,440
To play a game.

531
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,273
Don't talk about the FC like that.

532
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Up to you then.

533
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,571
If you want to have the lowest scores
Everyweek.

534
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,896
Up to you.

535
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:25,686
Hey.

536
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:26,846
Everyone.

537
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,032
Tomorrow we get the mission.

538
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:29,252
The task will come in the morning.

539
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:30,396
Quickly eat and go to sleep.

540
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,437
Yes, sir.

541
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,320
Told you not to call me sir.

542
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,420
Eh.

543
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,640
Korn.

544
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,573
Why did you do this.

545
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,413
Ow

546
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,220
I saw you pushing it to the side of the plate

547
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,244
I thought you won't eat.

548
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,653
What not eat. Here

549
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,950
I save the best for last.

550
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,886
What is wrong with you man.

551
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:56,113
That is mine.

552
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,480
No. Oh no.

553
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,760
Earth and Korn can fight all the time.

554
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,780
I think we came here to compete.

555
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:03,933
Not to have fun.

556
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:05,413
I'm not eating anymore.

557
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,020
You guys fighting over food?

558
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,233
Peek.

559
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,620
You don't understand.

560
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,346
We cannot share food.

561
00:33:14,913 --> 00:33:15,913
This is a big deal.

562
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:17,286
Hey.

563
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,650
Your big deal.

564
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,240
Might be someones small problems.

565
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:22,226
Look here.

566
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:23,446
Hey.

567
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:25,446
Oh no!

568
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,200
I don't mind sharing. See.

569
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:29,086
But I don't like.

570
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,673
You take it.

571
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:32,053
And go get me a new one

572
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,326
I won't eat this.

573
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:34,860
Then you can have mine.

574
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,275
And you already had.

575
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
No I haven't.

576
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:38,513
Oh.

577
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:41,713
Disgusting.

578
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,089
- Humm.
- Hey.

(Cute! Good that we get to watch something)

581
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:46,993
I will play the cups.

582

583
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,220
Yeah sure.

584
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,233
Come on. Ready to hit.

585
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,133
Ready to hit. Smells good
I'm opening.

(I can already sing along with this song)

589
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,054
You said you didn't come to play.

590
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:06,240
Well.

591
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:07,540
Sometimes.

592
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,793
If I'm too serious
I'm scared I will be stressed.

593
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,613
You played because you wanted to be close to Most?

594
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,333
Huh.

595
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,180
That I don't know.

596

Theres a moment.

605

Hello, Y Idol.

Qualities of being an idol.

617
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:48,724
You need to know how to work in a team.

618
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:50,026
Work hard and have patience.

619

Have unity.

620
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,503

00:36:58,606 --> 00:36:59,767
I want to be with P.

643
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,206
P, the legend.

644
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,633
I can be with any team.

645
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:05,346
I will give in my best.

646
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:08,080
I

647
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Will be mentor for.

648
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:12,613
Achi, Earth and Peek.

649
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:15,706
And I.

650
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:17,226
Will be mentor for Most.

651
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:18,560
Kla and Korn.

652
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,950
Yay.

653
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,482
Hurr.

654
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,333
Why can't we choose our own teams.

655
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,006
Yeah.

656
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:53,477
Dew is still young.

657
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:55,116
Will he be able to handle.

658
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,386
A task.

659
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:59,666
They've given a task
And we have to do it.

660
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,241
Wives team will be a little late.

661
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:06,585
Wives team will be a little late.

662
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:09,773
Sorry.

663
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:10,540
Just now.

664
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:11,933
What did you say.

665
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:13,120
Well

666
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,260
I only said to the staff that
You guys will be a little late.

667
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,520
And why do you have to call use the Wives team.

668
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,026
Oh! The code we use on the sets.

669
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:22,453
Don't be too serious about it.

670
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:24,393
Wait, wait, wait.

671
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,913
You call me a wife?

672
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,000
Look at my abs man.

673
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:32,426
Is it like this.

674
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,580
Don't be serious.

675
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
A role Earth.

676
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,000
If you can do it you are amazing.

677
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Peek.

678
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,866
Why are you being annoyed.

679
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,606
The staff will see you as a problematic person.

680
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:53,540
But you shouldn't be using this word.

681
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:55,706
And.

682
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:57,550
Pla and Toon didn't tell us like this.

683
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:01,314
But Pla and Toon are not the producers of the show.

684
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
What can they do.

685
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:06,097
But they shouldn't be forcing like this.

686
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,080
(V want Papa's name to be Kla
Husband Wife... They look like that)

687
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,549
(I'm watching you You. You are crossing the gender binary. Some people may prefer it differently Better not call them husband wife)

688
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:13,573
Wife again.

689
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,333
Well.

690
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,146
Look at Kla's physique.

691
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,793
You want him to be your wife?

692
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:20,313
Umm.

693
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:21,899
Not like that.

694
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:25,486
But when I signed the agreement
Toon said we need to act as friends.

695
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:26,693
Yes.

696
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,713
But how other people see us.

697
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,933
We can't stop them.

698
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,272
You want to play rock paper scissors with me.

699
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:34,998
If you win you can be the man.

700
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,303
I'm not serious.

701
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:37,713
Yeah.

702
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:38,993
Do you want to?

703
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,220
I see many people doing this.

704
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:43,553
Well well.

705
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Peek.

706
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,723
Do as much as you can do.

707
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:48,420
But I promise

708
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,000
I will not pressure you.

709
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
Huh.

710
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Wait.

711
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:10,046
Whats happening.

712
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Nothing.

713
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:15,946
Don't want to be on my team?

714
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:17,543
Huh Peek.

715
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:21,713
Not like that.

716
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:27,886
Peek.

717
00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:30,353
Every industry is like this.

718
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:32,806
We can't choose by ourselves.

719
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,413
The market chooses for us.

720
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,906
And if they want us to be.

721
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:40,486
We have to be for them.

722
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Understood?

723
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Do you understand.

724
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,154
If I win you in rock paper scissors.

725
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,333
Will you change teams.

726
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
I don't mind it.

727
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,840
But will they.

728
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,193
Will they allow.

729
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
You serious?

730
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,536
Even Pla said.

731
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:24,806
Some couples they do this.

732
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:27,715
And you want your life.

733
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,820
To depend on rock paper scissors.

734
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:33,680
I want my fate
To be decided by me.

735
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,180
Not by anyone else.

736
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:40,653
Come come come.

737
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,286
One two three.

738
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:55,913
You can't run away from your fate Peek.

739
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:00,446
Let's go Korn.

740
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:05,875
See you.

741
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:25,553
(Y IDOL CREW)(Good at having problems. Everyone careful with calling the wives team)(Is he scared of really becoming a wife)(Word choices are beyond us)(As medias, we shouldn't be saying anything)

742
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,316
(Y IDOL CREW)(You scolding me?)(Scolding Tookta)(The dance teacher is very serious.)(I don't have any drama content for highlight)(Okay. I will find another teacher)

743
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,580
(Next Break)
Honestly Peek, do you have passion for this.

744
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:31,873
Can you show me.

745
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Because I don't see it.

746
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,880
Why are you rehearsing so much.

747
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:38,303
You can do it.

748
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:39,693
You just have to dance cutely.

749
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,600
And you are already cute anyway.

750
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,999
(Kru Oh Kittichai Nattayasakul, Dance Instructor)
For this week, our idols.

751
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,353
Are going to compete in a dance battle.

752
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:07,893
(Thanks for not forgetting that this is an idol competition)
(This team is going to win. Kla used to be a child singer)
Five, six.

753
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:08,486
(This team will definitely win. Kla used to be a child singer)

754
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,060
(P's team will definitely win. I can assure you.)
Seven. My symptoms.

755
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:15,496
(I think the steps are too easy. But what can we say, it's Thai idols)(Most is very dancy #Mommysboy) Is not called being scared. But it is called being respectful.

756
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,003
(If anyones scared of his wife, it's yellow shirt)(Don't call Achi wife, hes a boy)(We're in a reality show not gender class)(Great job) While rehearsing. Looks like P's team is doing great
And the teachers looks impressed.

757
00:43:20,027 --> 00:43:22,443
(Is that Kru Vi that Kla Peek acted with before?)
Even though some changes are still needed.

758
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:23,676
(Kru Vivienne, Vichien Vongse Vacharavich, Acting coach)
(Yes, yes. I remember the pciture)
Korn.

759
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,853
Be a little cooler.

760
00:43:25,004 --> 00:43:26,556
Oh! Sure
Okay.

761
00:43:26,558 --> 00:43:27,783
Most.

762
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,040
But then what.

763
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:31,734
Don't forget
You won't forget right.

764
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,467
Kla, please see to everyone
Help them rehearse.

765
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:36,253
(Whats the show thinking. The coach can be bias)(Kla was chosen to take care of others, favourite kid?)(Are you going to drama with everything?) While Dew's team.

766
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,080
Looks like they are having some issues.

767
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:44,691
(Why is an acting coach here for dance class Dance)(You need to act when dancing) When our youngest contenstant isn't doing the character As the show has assigned.

768
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:46,020
(Did they cast #Youkilledmyfather boy as a joke? He can't do anything.)
Peek.

769
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:47,080
When you are stressed.

770
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:50,249
(It's true. Hes tensed like dancing in a funeral)

771
00:43:50,273 --> 00:43:51,427
(The above comment is too harsh)
It comes out like.

772
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:53,111
You are doing just for the heck of it.

773
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,549
(Or not true. He looks like he can cry all the time)(I don't know what to say)

774
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:57,253
(Again. Drama again)(Song is like from marvel movie)

775
00:43:57,277 --> 00:43:59,277
Do you really have a passion for this?

776
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:03,902
(Feel bad for Peek, he gets scolded everytime)(He's sad again.)(I feel bad for him. Im going to cheer him from now)

777
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:06,660
(The teacher is so mean. I'm gonna cry.)
Then please show it to me.

778
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
(Teacher's question is so direct. I like it.)
Cause I don't see it.

779
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,983
(Don't bash him. I feel bad)(He deserves it. Live also stiff, dance also stiff. I think he should leave)

780
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,007
Yes.

781
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
(I've learnt dancing with this teacher before. He's not mean but this time it must be really bad)(Is this scripted?)

782
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:18,411
(Choreographer is very kind. Thats why they got him?)(Peek, leave. Many people want to be in your place)

783
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:22,253
I don't know.

784
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,100
I tried already.

785
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:26,107
Why isn't it good enough.

786
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,773
How much do I need to do
To make it enough.

787
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,400
Damn it Peek.

788
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,633
Sleep first will you.

789
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:03,750
Rehearse again tomorrow.

790
00:45:06,758 --> 00:45:08,520
I don't want to lose another week.

791
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,345
Your problem is not with not rehearsing.

792
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:13,903
But you.

793
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,463
Are not in character

794
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:18,013
pretense.

795
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:23,840
Do you think Im pretending.

796
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:28,747
No.

797
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,669
Hey. Seriously.

798
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,190
I was born this way.

799
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:34,790
So I have to make it work.

800
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,843
It is a character.

801
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,903
Then when Most does things for you.

802
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:47,380
That is you finding your selling point?

803
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:48,837
You think.

804
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,326
When Most is outside.

805
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,473
He always plays lame jokes.

806
00:45:57,308 --> 00:45:58,308
Huh.

807
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:00,473
And Korn.

808
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:03,673
Do you think he will speak Esan
With people who doesn't understand?

809
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,620
Everyone finds a selling point
To create a story.

810
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
I see.

811
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,249
What do I sell?

812
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,733
Earth.

813
00:46:37,155 --> 00:46:37,680
Yeah.

814
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,041
Look.

815
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,293
Quick.

816
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:52,529
Hey.

817
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,219
Korn.

818
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,046
Are you being a medium?

819
00:46:55,424 --> 00:46:56,986
Are you possessed?

820
00:47:02,593 --> 00:47:03,780
Im in my character.

821
00:47:05,227 --> 00:47:06,643
The teacher told me to be cooler.

822
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:08,933
Really.

823
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,133
Seriously.

824
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,726
This is cool?

825
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,653
Oye! You lame
Hey.

826
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:15,897
You damn.

827
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:17,217
Out of character?

828
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:19,103
It can't.

829
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:21,007
Cannot.

830
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:23,313
You are sitting still like a stick.

831
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:25,827
Did Peek already eat?

832
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,849
Umm.

833
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,736
I saw him going to rehearsals since morning.

834
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:32,567
He hasn't eaten.

835
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,000
Why are you practising so hard.

836
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:02,904
Not going to eat food?

837
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:05,753
I already had.

838
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:07,127
Don't lie to me.

839
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,340
I know everything about you.

840
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:14,967
If you are not going to eat.

841
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:16,193
Then drink this.

842
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:19,373
Here.

843
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:20,720
Take it.

844
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,333
It's refreshing.

845
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,293
And also.

846
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:26,373
Getting something into your body.

847
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:39,673
Hows it?

848
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:40,703
Delicious?

849
00:48:41,173 --> 00:48:42,173
If you want more.

850
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:43,933
Theres more in the fridge.

851
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,856
If nothing else
I am going back to rehearse.

852
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,120
Peek.

853
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,910
Why are you rehearsing so hard.

854
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
Take it easy.

855
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:58,617
You can do it.

856
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Just dancing cutely.

857
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:02,654
And you are already cute anyway.

858
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:08,693
What cute.

859
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,242
Why.

860
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,880
Or you want me to say that you look horrible?

861
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:23,800
(Reaching for)

862
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:32,992
Look at the steps.

863
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
Give it here.

864
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,086
Let me show you something.

865
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:47,247
Look.

866
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:49,253
Here.

867
00:49:49,307 --> 00:49:50,307
See.

868
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:51,867
Everyone can do it.

869
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,709
It's not the same.

870
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:58,027
There is a pose to swing the hips.

871
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,579
What are you scared of.

872
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:01,153
Look at Earth.

873
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
He's a complete man.

874
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
But he doesn't care.

875
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
If you are not.

876
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,780
Then just do it.

877
00:50:10,013 --> 00:50:11,013
Theres nothing to worry.

878
00:50:18,813 --> 00:50:19,813
Or.

879
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:22,127
Are you?

880
00:50:23,507 --> 00:50:25,947
Thats why you can't dance
You are scared people will find out.

881
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:27,927
Not that.

882
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:28,991
Hey.

883
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,819
If you have anything.

884
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,220
You can speak to me.

885
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I won't tell anybody.

886
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Theres nothing.

887
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,444
If you want me to do like Earth
I can too.

888
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:42,107
Here.

889
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:47,387
Here.

890
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,667
If you want me to believe.

891
00:50:55,493 --> 00:50:56,933
You are going to have to try harder.

892
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
You weakling.

893
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:45,727
Again Peek.

894
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:47,064
It's not perfect.

895
00:51:51,926 --> 00:51:52,539
Again Peek.

896
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:53,682
Show me some bones.

897
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:00,733
Again.

898
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,660
Again Peek.

899
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,140
Again Peek.

900
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:05,816
Again Peek.

901
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:06,420
Again.

902
00:52:06,607 --> 00:52:06,987
Again.

903
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,220
Again.

904
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,053
- Again.
- More.

905
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,287
Shit.

906
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,311
Hey, really better Peek.

907
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:34,853
But I think it's not enough.

908
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,770
If we want to win.

909
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,367
It has got to be perfect.

910
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,120
Dew is going to come and see soon.

911
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,727
Can I have one last time.

912
00:52:45,113 --> 00:52:45,387
Come.

913
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,647
Hey.

914
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:48,300
Give him a break man.

915
00:52:48,826 --> 00:52:50,500
He hasn't eaten all day.

916
00:52:50,947 --> 00:52:51,252
Please.

917
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:52,500
Peek. Please.

918
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:54,073
For the team.

919
00:52:54,777 --> 00:52:55,777
Please.

920
00:52:57,734 --> 00:52:59,340
After Dew comes you can go rest.

921
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Okay.

922
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,131
I wasn't thinking anything that time

923
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:04,487
I wasn't tired.

924
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:07,087
I was only thinking
I want to do for Dew

925
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,333
I want to do for the team

926
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:09,900
I want to prove myself.

927
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:24,893
That's it Peek.

928
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:26,177
Amazing.

929
00:53:26,265 --> 00:53:27,425
So cute.

930
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:29,396
True. Really good.

931
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:31,036
If I didn't know you

932
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,280
I wouldve thought you were...

933
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:35,944
But.

934
00:53:36,453 --> 00:53:37,453
Who wouldve thought.

935
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:39,193
Something would happen.

936
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:42,467
Really good.

937
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,473
Peek.

938
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:47,533
Peek.

939
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:07,613
Good job.

940
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:08,733
Yes. Sync well.

941
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:09,827
P

942
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:10,993
Peek has fainted.

943
00:54:11,253 --> 00:54:12,253
What?

944
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,507
What's wrong.

945
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:23,824
Peek.

946
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,413
Nurse, where are you. Come here.

947
00:54:25,853 --> 00:54:26,853
Quick.

948
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:27,860
Ouch.

949
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:29,251
It hurts.

950
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:31,617
Is he all right?

951
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:37,073
Are you okay.

952
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:39,496
Oh.

953
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:41,347
Please let him rest for a bit.

954
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,759
And do not put any weight on the ankle this side.

955
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,980
If it gets swollen
Then he won't be able to dance on saturday.

956
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:56,007
(Y IDOL CREW)(Peek fainted, send the staff there now.)(Tell the others to wait in the room.)(Aom, tell Jim to set up the camera at the nurse room.)

957
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:57,814
(Y IDOL CREW)(If anything happens to them, we'll get in trouble)(Boss, don't pretend to be a good person)(This is a reality show, how can we not get a footage of this?)

958
00:54:57,838 --> 00:54:59,173
(Y IDOL CREW)(Jim is ready.)(The husband team is in front of the room, should we let them in?)(Wait for me, I'm coming)

959
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,197
Dew.

960
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:02,280
(Next Week)
It's my request.

961
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:03,853
Please don't change the steps

962
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,330
I don't want the team to be in trouble because of me.

963
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:07,573
Very good team spirit, Peek.

964
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,930
Oh! Dead.

965
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:10,033
Ouch.

966
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:11,360
- Nurse.
- Nurse please.

967
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,036
Don't you wanna win with me?

968
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
The game is on! Peek
