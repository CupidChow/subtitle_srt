Help? Bro, brother.

11
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,044
You get frightened really easily.

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,977
Ouch.

13
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,750

There will surely be drama.

Umm. One more left.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,555
Hey.

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,311
What the heck you doing.

22
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,044
This is against the rules of the show.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,377
Just a little.

No.

How's it going.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,688

00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:56,800
Most.

32
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,266
Please take care of me Most.

33
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:17,688
Sure brother.

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,222
Peek might want to win.

35
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,222
He's really good at playing games.

36
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,622
And are you angry at him?

37
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,266
That he stole your partner.

38
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,377
Staying away from Most might be good.

39
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,288
So Most will miss me.

40
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:38,688
The person who should be angry.

41
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,244
Shouldn't it be Kla?

42
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:53,222

Amazing.

Should we go with this song?

52
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,488
I think there should be
a verse where you can...

sing well.

Thank you.

61
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,644
I'm surprised that you chose me.

62
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,733
Why?

63
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,414
Well, I see that
you are very close to Kla.

64
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,333
Or Korn.

65
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,800
Didn't think you would choose me.

66
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,666
Honestly.

67
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,396
I really like to sing.

68
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,000
But I am not that confident.

69
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,244
Do you remember your live
And I came in to sing with you.

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,133
Aha.

71
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,955
That's it
I sang with you and I got more confidence.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,622
Oh.

73
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,834
I thought you had a fight with Kla.

74
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,950
Kla likes to annoy me.

75
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,170
So I wanted to try working with someone else.

76
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,844

You were too focused on singing high keys.

109

You didn't convey.

110

333
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,155
Trying to steal your scene here.

334
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,688
Hey.

335
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,460
Aren't you thinking too much.

336
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,800
Hes doing it for the team.

337
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,977
But only one person can win.

338
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:59,210
(Every Tuesday at 9pm, On TTV)

339
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,840
They look like real celebrities.

340
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,133
Your son was really good.

341
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,800
Face expressions and eyes
All on spot.

342
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,777
We are not Achi's parents.

343
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,333
We are Most's parents.

344
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,644
- I am Mosts's father.
- Yes.

345
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,800
The staff said that Achi's father isn't here today He's busy.

346
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,930
He's always like that.

347
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,970
Always busy. He's never free.

348
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,977
But the children are cute.

349
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,050
He knows it well
They always talk.

350
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,760
Singing competition.

351
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,130
Amazing.

352
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,090
- Really good.
- Hmm.

353
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,470
No ones giving in to one another.

354
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,650
Both of them, really good competition
Both are handsome.

355
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,220
Hows it? The show has already ended.

356
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
(How can he be okay, it was messed up)
(What can I trust about this industry?)
(Then who asked you to trust them)

357

(How can he be okay, it was messed up)
(What can I trust about this industry?)
(Then who asked you to trust them)
Not okay.

358

(How can he be okay, it was messed up)
(What can I trust about this industry?)
(Then who asked you to trust them)

359
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,820
(Gateway: Korn, damn it. Can't you hold your emotions
Can't go into the ad now, time isn't enough)

360
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,490
(Bank: Achi will handle it)

361
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,180
(- Aom: We are on trend 2.
- Gateway: This is good then, good drama)

362
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,970
(Gateway: Boss, get Earth Kla to standby.
Praise the moment of Achi and Korn, don't forget)

363
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,900
(- Boss: Don't they have to focus.
- Gateway: Oh you, do it so they want to service more.)

364

(Gateway: This week we need
to be on number 1)

365
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,310
(Next Break)
I might change the plan a bit.

366
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,133
You just go with the flow.

367
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,355
What.

368
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,050
And now the results...

369
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Are in my hands.

370
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,780
Wohoo.

371
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:54,450
No ones giving in to one another
Both of them really competitive and handsome.

372
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,330
Hows it? The show has already ended.

373

(What can I trust about this industry)
(Then who asked you to trust them)

376
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,950
Not okay that the show ended too quickly.

377
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,888
(The last moment was so cute.)
(Would be cuter if it was with Most)
Ah. Not okay because it ended.

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,844
(Y fans only come to cheer.)(How far will this industry go)
Because the happy moments always go by fast.

379
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,466

That's right Gun Aeng.

380
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:11,290
That's right.

381
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,740
Our next show is...

then go to the Voice, this is celebrity show)
Also ready.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,888

Right and they are.

384
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,210

386

Why is it like this Toon.

388
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,755
Here.

389
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,577
Did you see Korn and Achi.

390
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,977
The last moment.

391
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,000
The audience were screaming.

392
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,422
We already rehearsed well.

393
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,210
Mentors like it.

We also liked it, right?

396
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,444
We just do as we rehearsed.

397
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
Don't think about the other pairs.

398
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,733
Okay.

Hey.

Did you see me up there?

465

Listen to me.

479
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,866
I didn't mean to steal your verse.

When a lot of people were cheering up.

481

Don't be mad at me.

483

Really?

484
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,911
You don't say anything Peek.

485
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,590
You are another one.

486
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,577
If you didn't instigate me
I won't be over thinking.

487
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,290
Hold on.

488
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,550
How did I insigate you?

489
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,777
I only came to warn you.

490
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,844
But in the end
Didn't Achi do as I said.

491
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,377
Oh wow.

492
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,911
Were you that scared of loosing.

493
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,020
You want to find a selling point to create a story
It's your problem.

494
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,400
But what right do you have.

495
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,866
To destroy someone else's story.

496
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Wait.

497
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,311
Whose did I destroy.

498
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,111
And why did you kiss me.

499
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,288
We spoke about this.

500
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:02,600
The feels was right.

501
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,288
And what problem do you have.

502
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,220
Because of that moment, you won tonight.

503
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,444
I just can't kiss with anyone.

504
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,955
And I didn't allow you to kiss me.

505
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,466
You kissing me like this is harassment.

506
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,955
If I told the crew.

507
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,840
You would be doing against the rules.

508
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,888
But isn't it a game.

509
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,400
Everyone does it.

510
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
You want to play like this Peek.

511
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,288
Playing the game
Without caring about other peoples feelings.

512
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,688
Is this your truth.

513
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,622
Calm down Korn.

514
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,022
Yeah.

515
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,600
Someone else recognizes you now.

516
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,133
Good.

517
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,460
I won't be lonely anymore.

518
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,970
What are you saying?

519
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,400
About you playing the game.

520
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,444
It started since you hurt your leg.

521
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Hold on Achi.

522
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
What about the leg.

523
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:23,777
Peek.

524
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,466
Don't tell me that the leg.

525
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,222
Was really a lie.

526
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,311
Say it Peek.

527
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,200
Voice: Can we have all the idols in the main hall.

528
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,200
Voice: For the special surprise.

529
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,890
Woo.

530
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,430
(Gateway: Fans favourite person
got the trend up to number 1)
(Bank: Mom, they are fighting in front of the house, should we get the camera)

531
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,540
(Gateway: No need because foot of Peek
kissing Most can't go out)
(Boss: Means he can just go against the rules.
But FC needs to get their moment, like this?)

532
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,177
(Gateway: And that's showbiz, kids)

533
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,510
(Next Break)
Most, son.

534
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,488
It's money dad.

535
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:01,900
If I win, we would get lots of money.

536
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,720
Our situation will be better.

537
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Next time.

538
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,200
Don't mess with my life.

539
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Most, son, Most

540
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,600
*Chatting in excitement*

541
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,720
- Dad.
- How are you? Are you okay?

542
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:42,888
There he is, Peek.

543
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:43,822
Peek.

544
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:46,955
Peek.

545
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:52,355
Peek, I am here.

546
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,733
Dad, he's here.

547
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,444
Come here quick.

548
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:08,577
Quick.

549
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:12,688
Oye! My son. Oh.

550
00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:13,711
Come here quick.

551
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:16,933
Come here. Sit first.

552
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:19,555
Sit, sit, sit.

553
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,370
How are you.

554
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,210
Achi.

555
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,810
Your parents can't come today.
Do you want to go wait inside?

556
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,250
Oh.

557
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,850
It's okay

558
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,466
I will go out and stay by myself.

559
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,688
Why did you lie to me.

560
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,822
Calm down dad.

561
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,810
Didn't you say...

562
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,170
it was just a singing competition?

563
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,650
If I told you honestly
You would never allow.

564
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,370
Whatever I am doing.

565
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,955
Do you think it's fun?

566
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,777
Do you know what all I have to go through?

567
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,355
What I'm doing, I'm doing to help the family.

568
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,066
By kissing with guys on TV?

569
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,222
Hmm.

570
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,466
Have you ever thought...

571
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,266
if it was suitable?

572
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,511
I'm not your student dad.

573
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,133
And can't I teach my own son?

574
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:01,911
Huh?

575
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,444
Why didn't you think of me?

576
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,111
What if other relatives...

577
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,688
or the principal sees this,

578
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,770
what will I do?

579
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,888
Dad.

580
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,422
Softer.

581
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,311
Amazing.

582
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,530
Other parents, when they see their kids
They ask...

583
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,733
Are you tired? How are you?

584
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,777
But you.

585
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,066
You do like you're ashamed.

586
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,822
I'm not ashamed.

587
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,800
I just don't understand.

588
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,555
How did I go wrong?

589
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,770
Huh, how did I bring you up...

590
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,090
that you became like this?

591
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,977
Umm.

592
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,022
Ah.

593
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,400
Hello dad, hello mom.

594
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,355
Peek.

595
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,333
You ready?

596
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,288
In a bit.

597
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,930
The crew will come to interview.

598
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,800
This is money dad.

599
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,244
If I win, we will get lots of money.

600
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,022
Our family will be a lot better.

601
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,250
Please.

602
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,955
Help be nice to me for 5 minutes
At least in front of the camera.

603
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,088
You can hate me all you want.

604
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,444
I don't hate you.

605
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,155
Do this for me.

606
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,755
Do it for our family.

607
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,711
Next year you will be retiring.

608
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,644
We need money from this show.

609
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,533
Are you ready?
Mom, dad?

610
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,133
Ready.

611
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:03,955
Son.

612
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,422
Why are you sitting there.

613
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,130
Come here quick. Come sit here.

614
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,330
Come here, here.

615
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:15,511
Come

616
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,088
5,4,3,2

617
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,488
Mom and dad
Do you have anything to say to Peek.

618
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,844
I do.

619
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,888
Don't overdo son

620
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,800
I am so proud of you.

621
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,088
My son.

622
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,288
Oh, and.

623
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,450
Please support my son, everyone.

624
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,600
Do not forget to press like
Lots of likes.

625
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,488
I hope that you.

626
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,422
Succeed in everything you think of doing.

627
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,266
Can you say a little more please.

628
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,222
However, we are.

629
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,977
Always here to support you.

630
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,010
Keep fighting son.

631
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,511
Hearing like this, I am ready to fight.

632
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,222
Take care of yourself.

633
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,111
Can you?

634
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,450
Here.

635
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,466
You've lost weight.

636
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,930
Go home safe.

637
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,022
Um, yeah.
Go home safe.

638
00:44:42,022 --> 00:44:43,111
Um, yeah.

639
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,690
Oh, here.

640
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,111
Um.

641
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,530
I got this for you.

642
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,555
In case you missed my cooking.

643
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,822
Your dad is not angry at you.

644
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,355
He came here to cheer you.

645
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,888
You know! He was taking
hours to choose his clothes.

646
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:12,533
But...

647
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,844
After reaching here. Yeah.

648
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:16,444
He might...

649
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,044
Have been shocked.

650
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,866
Look at your face.

651
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,933
Sulking like a baby.

652
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,570
You're my son. You must be strong, okay?

653
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:30,422
Hmm.

654
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,644
Oh and.

655
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,200
Don't lose to anyone.

656
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,355
Do you understand?

657
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,490
Fight!

658
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:37,888
Yes.

659
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,555
Hm! This is it.

660
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Come here. Give me a hug.

661
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:44,244
Go home safely.

662
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,090
Sure.

663
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,355
Win and come.

664
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,866
I'm here for you.

665
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,488
Fighting.

666
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:54,050
I'm going. Bye.

667
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,933
Dad. Where did he go.

668
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,066
You know your father is a teacher.

669
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,733
And look
You got called into the principal's office.

670
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:50,730
Hmm.

671
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,090
Sigh.

672
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:59,666
Boys fighting these days
It's normal.

673
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,444
But this is not something to fight about.

674
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,266
Next time.

675
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,250
Tell me.

676
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:06,822
Huh.

677
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,644
Let them see me.

678
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,822
I guarantee.

679
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,170
They will never tease you again.

680
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:13,644
Why?

681
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,044
Who teased him?

682
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:15,690
Oye.

683
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,355
His friends, they teased him that he's gay.

684
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,410
Oh that?

685
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,044
The reason he fought with them
was because he was called a gay?

686
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,090
And you.

687
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,590
Stop doing those girly things.

688
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,022
Um.

689
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,288
Dad.

690
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:32,177
Don't make him feel worse.

691
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,533
He's already hurt.

692
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,111
And why are you crying.

693
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,511
Being Teacher Sakda's son.

694
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,600
You must be strong.

695
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,650
Come. Let's go. Let's have dinner.

696
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,610
Lotus root soup.

697
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,577
Your favourite, isn't it?

698
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,311
- Let's go eat.
- Come on. Quick.

699
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,050
Why are you crying.

700
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,010
Did it go bad?

701
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,530
I'm sorry.

702
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:51,970
I just don't want to see you sad.

703
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:56,088
I just came to know what all you've been through.

704
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,022
I understand you.

705
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,577
Really?

706
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,000
But I don't.

707
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,511
In this era. There are people who can't accept this.

708
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,955
If the show puts this on the highlight.

709
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,666
The viewers will think this is so cliche.

710
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:18,850
It's okay you.

711
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,450
Whatever the era is.

712
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,422
There are people.

713
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:24,850
Who understands.

714
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,450
And those who don't understand.

715
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,444
They were brought up that way.

716
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,000
It's not easy for them.

717
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,200
And they think it's easy for me?

718
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,370
Come on.

719
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,911
Give him some time.

720
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,090
Don't be angry at your dad, Peek.

721
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,890
I'm not angry

722
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,250
I just feel sad.

723
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,355
He acts like I don't mean anything.

724
00:50:06,466 --> 00:50:07,933
You have value Peek.

725
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,770
At least.

726
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:17,890
For me.

727
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,022
♪ The more I forbid
The more the heart resists ♪

728
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,090
♪ My heart is stubborn and refuses to listen ♪

729
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,700
♪ The more I try to force it ♪

730
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,530
♪ The more it defies me ♪

731
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,650
♪ And I end up thinking about you every time ♪

732
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,690
Hey.

733
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,810
Let me warm this for you.

734
00:50:49,155 --> 00:50:50,355
Your mom made it.

735
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,088
It's easy for you to say.

736
00:50:58,244 --> 00:50:59,822
Your family isn't like this.

737
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,333
Next time.

738
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,222
Don't mess with my life.

739
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,488
Focus on your work.

740
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,400
Peek.

741
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,333
You had to be this harsh.

742
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,022
I'm worried about you.

743
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,488
Why are you lashing at me.

744
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,555
I didn't even say anything about.

745
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,733
You messing with other people.

746
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,730
Honestly.

747
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,577
In this house.

748
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:58,930
Nobody wants you anymore.

749
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:01,955
Except for me.

750
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,711
If the day, I can't tolerate you anymore.

751
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,066
You will have no one else Peek.

752
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,644
Hello, can you hear.

753
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,488
Can you hear me.

754
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,577
Can you hear me.

755
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,911
You can't then that's it
I'm hanging up.

756
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,066
Bye.

757
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,290
Hello everyone.

758
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,044
Today we are not here in the afternoon.
But we are here at night.

759
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,511
Sundays like this.

760
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,911
We bring you all to look at the stars
No. Probably not.

761
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,444
Because I am here today
For the show.

762
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,890
Waii Jai Y Idol.

763
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,420
(Waii Jai Y Idol)

764
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,022
You all must be missing this.

765
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,533
- Do you miss it?
- We do.

766
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,844
The whole time you are in the camp.

767
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:01,890
You don't get to touch it.

768
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,044
(The rules are very easy)

769
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:08,133
(Right now the crew have hidden these phones
in different parts of the camp)

770
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,555
(Go and find it)

771
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:12,333
(If it's the one that can open and has signal)

772
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,177
(That is the right one)

773
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,111
(Who can bring it to Seoulsay first)

774
00:53:16,177 --> 00:53:17,600
(That person is the winner)

775
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,177
Therefore, now.

776
00:53:20,222 --> 00:53:21,488
If everyone is ready.

777
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,770
Go and give support to everyone. Let's go!

778
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,044
The privilege that Peek got last week.

779
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:31,266
Was really peak.

780
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,200
If I get the mobile phone.

781
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,355
I might get airtime like other people.

782
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,911
It's the final week now.

783
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:56,210
To play it just for fun would be.

784
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,266
Can't do it anymore.

785
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,170
Game on.

786
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,133
There is no friendship in the battle field.

787
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,822
If you can kill, kill
Who ever dies, let them be.

788
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,610
Hello Pond.

789
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:20,850
What are you watching.

790
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:21,930
Did I come disturb you?

791
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,111
Oh no
Just watching something interesting.

792
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,970
You came at the right time, K. Tai.

793
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:32,022
Um. Not sure if TTV is interested in him like me?

794
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,960
(He'll win the whole thing.
Who needs talent to be trended?)

795
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,700
(Love triangle. Is 3P a new trends in the BL World.)

796
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,910
(Y-Idol Crew)
(Gateway: Why didn't anyone get the footage
of Kla Peek fighting in the kitchen? Answer!!)

797
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,660
(Boss: It's past filming time.
We shouldn't invade their privacy)

798
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,130
(Gateway: Boss, he signed the contract.
They allow us to do everything)

799
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,300
(Boss: He signed the contract that no filming after 10pm
We created the rules, why are we breaking it?)

800
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,900
(Gateway removed Boss. Gateway invited K. Pond
K. Pond joined the group)

801
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,540
(K.Pond: Anyone else got any problem?)

802
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,180
(Next Week) What ever role you played
You were always taken, right.

803
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,010
Hey, Achi.

804
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,488
This time is too much.

805
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,844
I don't want you to do any more worse, Peek.

806
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,711
Peek, come with me.

807
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,955
If there is nothing, he should be back now.

808
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,155
He did against the rules twice.

809
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,177
There must be some penalty.

810
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:10,822
What did you speak to K. Pond?

811
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,266
You weren't punished, were you.

812
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,088
But you were taken, right?
