1
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:16,500
Done. Sweet as honey.

2
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,834
Thank you!

3
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:19,459
Thank you for what?

4
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm the one who had to thank you.

5
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:26,667
You took a good care of your skin.
It's easy to work with. Easy for make up.

6
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,876
Here's a picture of yesterday's work.

7
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:29,417
What?

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,644
See how it growed. So amazing.

9
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:32,111
(Anyone knows his social media account?)
See how it growed. So amazing.

10
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,533
(I think I'm falling in love.)
See how it growed. So amazing.

11
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:38,834
Add a little to the eye corner,
a little pink, it's a full ten.

12
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:43,667
You want him to hire you full time,
just say it.

13
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,334
Don't just beat by the bush.

14
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,751
P'Mod, she knows it all.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you dissing me?

16
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,292
Oh, no.

17
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:59,000
Is Pan better?

18
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,959
Oh, I'm OK now.

19
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,417
The director cut the scene so that you can rest.

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,125
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,834
Khun Koon, here's porridge and
Patongko that you requested.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,834
They are still hot.

23
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,834
He can't eat fried food.

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,792
Today there is a kiss scene.

25
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:23,584
But you said that Pan wants porridge.

26
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:27,083
Not today and today I haven't said a thing.

27
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:29,186
I will tell you when he wants it again.

28
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,334
So what is he going to eat today?

29
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,626
Anything. I'm not picky.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

31
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:41,876
Anything.

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,292
Yes, mam.

33
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:53,444
(Nott sent you a message.)

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,066
(What took you so long?
To get here. I missed you.)

35
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:33,755
(War of Y)

36
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,792
Can you do it?

37
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,999
Yes.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,209
Can you do it?

39
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,125
Yes!

40
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,751
Can you do it?

41
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,083
Yes, we can.

42
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,626
Yay!

43
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,125
Yes, now focus.
I'll go watch upstairs.

44
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,876
- Work hard, okay?
- OK!

45
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,375
OK.

46
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,834
Ok, ready?

47
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:30,918
Let's start. Three..2..1.. Action.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,834
Tim, run away.

49
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,751
How long must we run?

50
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,834
When I love a Mafia's brother.

51
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,751
I will protect you.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,209
OK. Cut!

53
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,918
It was good.
I think the vibe is going great.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I would like to add an extra shot.

55
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:43,834
Bew bends down and bite Gus's cheek.

56
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,000
Do it smoothly and sweetly.

57
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,709
Make him feel that
you both love and cherish him.

58
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:50,834
Get it?

59
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,484
Makeup, touch up.

60
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,509
Now it's extremely sweaty.

61
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,250
Make it neat.

62
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,459
Lighting team, let's get a little more light.

63
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,768
At this point, it's still not enough.

64
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,417
Make all the skin brighter and clearer.

65
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,959
Uh, wait.

66
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:05,292
Yes?

67
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:09,584
I think they are playing well.
Isn't it enough?

68
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,125
Well, it's enough, it's good.
And I gave them a pass.

69
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,500
But vibe is really good now, so.

70
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:22,209
I want to add an extra shot.
The customer asks for it too.

71
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,000
This couple is selling well.

72
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,500
Just a bit more.

73
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:38,584
Nong Pan?

74
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,542
Do you think Gus and Bew play well?

75
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,083
I think it's so so.

76
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:59,755
(Thank you for this.)

77
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:15,834
Do you and P'Tai want to drink water?
I'll go get it for you.

78
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,459
I will take plain water.

79
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,584
Alright, how about you?

80
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:28,417
Um, so give me green soda, red soda,
orange, and iced americano.

81
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,334
I want them all.

82
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,667
OK.

83
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,167
Just share.

84
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,292
I'll go help you.

85
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,626
Oh, it's okay.

86
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,792
Thanks.

87
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,667
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

88
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:58,500
Thank you, P'Pan.

89
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,667
Yes.

90
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,876
Oh, ready? Everything's ready.

91
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,626
Three..2..1. Action!

92
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,751
Cut!

93
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,417
Ah, both of them played very well. Good.

94
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:48,667
Good.

95
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,667
Very good.

96
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,000
Very talented, you all.

97
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,533
Pan, ah, how are you?

98
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:08,334
Yes?

99
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,709
How are you this scene?

100
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,918
I'm okay.

101
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,751
If you're not. I can postpone it.

102
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,417
Oh, it's okay, I can do it.

103
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:20,083
You sure? I can make it less intense.
Or we can just use cam angle to help.

104
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,083
Oh, no, really, I can do it.

105
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,000
You sure? Then, I'll wait and see.

106
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:25,667
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,375
Oh, okay, let's see.
Do your best.

108
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,000
Yep.

109
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Okay, let's go.

110
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,667
Lights ready? Camera? Smoke out.

111
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,209
Actor focus.

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,417
Ready, 3 2 1. Action!

113
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,542
Cut!

114
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,918
Good!

115
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,417
Very talented, very brave.
Thank you very much.

116
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,209
This scene, I'm sure that people will post about.

117
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,200
Another legendary scene. I'm sure.

118
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,734
Right, what do you think, Khun Tai?

119
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,709
Well, I think that's quite fine.

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,626
If we can act like this in every cue.

121
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,729
I think this scene, we will be famous.

122
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:36,834
Thank you.

123
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,000
Right? I think we are on the right path.

124
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,355
Yah? We're done. Next scene.
Set up the next scene.

125
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,022
Change set.

126
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,417
Fighting.

127
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,209
Good partner.

128
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,417
Good partner?

129
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,626
Pan.

130
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:28,209
Very good.
Go to the next set, hurry up.

131
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hurry up.

132
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:31,626
Oh.

133
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:32,459
Go.

134
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,977
Wait, where are you going?

135
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,209
Quickly, Nott.

136
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,100
Come help me.

137
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,367
- Bro.
- Untie this rope first.

138
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:39,709
Bro.

139
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,000
Hey, wait for me.

140
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:24,709
Still having headache?

141
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:41,834
Sorry,

142
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:50,209
that I was crazy and made you tired.

143
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
Is this a real or a fake Pan?

144
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,751
Or Nong Toh has not left the body yet?

145
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:18,999
Hey!

146
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,417
Don't have to apologize to me.

147
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:27,626
When you're crazy, it's cute.

148
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,311
When you irritated, it's cute.

149
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,244
When you're upset, it's cute.

150
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,577
And now you do this,

151
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,288
ever cuter!

152
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,417
If I can't help it, what would you do?

153
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,834
What?

154
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,229
If I can't help it, what would you do?

155
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:57,584
Ouch!

156
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:58,876
Pan.

157
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Don't you like to tease?

158
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,822
Director, Khun Khun passed this to you.

159
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,311
And Khun Tai too. In the room over there.

160
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,167
OK.

161
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,360
Don't forget to take it, Khun Tai.

162
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,417
OK.

163
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,626
Hello, I leave a small gift for you.

164
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,876
Please give Pan some love.
He's a little sick today.

165
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,955
But, don't worry about his spirit.

166
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:48,334
Well, if he is sick, I understand.

167
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,584
But thank him for acting his best.

168
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,751
If there is anything I can help you with,
you can always tell me.

169
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:08,209
Let's go.

170
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:09,959
- Don't forget to take it.
- Excuse me.

171
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,999
Yes.

172
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:15,083
Don't forget Khun Koon's gift.

173
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,709
Don't forget to get one.

174
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes, thank you.

175
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,459
One each.

176
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,626
Khun Toon, Khun Koon left a gift for you.

177
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,334
In the room.
Khun Toon, don't forget to pick it up.

178
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, thank you very much but it's okay.

179
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,733
(Koon: Was he that bad?
Buy presents for the crew then.)

180
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,288
(- Koon: Put them in the old boxes.
- Kartoon: Got it.)

181
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,059
(Next Break) This event is a battle of
the imagined couple, is it true?

182
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,542
Many people saw you two as the next Dew-P.

183
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,626
If we are the next,
then the original is outdated.

184
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,660
So this scene is another important scene.

185
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,020
I want this scene to come out very neat

186
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,580
because it's an NC scene.

187
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,100
- Uh, Bird?
- Yes?

188
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,220
What is NC?

189
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,500
Well, it's NO CHILDREN.

190
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,511
No children. Like no child?

191
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,020
Not suitable for children.

192
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:22,740
I see.

193
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Do you understand?

194
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,800
This is one of the important scenes,
like I told you.

195
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,340
Yes.

196
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,460
So you both must be like...

197
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,500
I don't want it to be just about sex.

198
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,500
It's about love. Get it, right?

199
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,580
It will take the relationship
between the characters to another level.

200
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,580
It's about Love. Various feelings inside

201
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,100
won't come out aggressive
like what we have seen.

202
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,780
OK.

203
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,620
Got it, right? Now, let's try this pose
and see what it's like.

204
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,620
What posture is good?

205
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
OK.

206
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,100
Oh, let's try,

207
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,540
Try put your hand up to the wall.

208
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,900
Try try try.

209
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,900
Raise your leg.

210
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,860
You don't have to lift your leg.
Raise your arms.

211
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,900
How to do it?

212
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,460
I'll show you what I want.

213
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:09,740
OK.

214
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,300
You turn like this.

215
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
Do this.

216
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,420
And I come in like this.

217
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,100
Wait. Nott, you try it with him.

218
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,500
Oh.

219
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
So you can get comfortable.

220
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:20,940
OK.

221
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,900
Come on. Do it like I did.

222
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,020
Don't forget that it has to be gentle.

223
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,340
Ah, let's try it out.

224
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,620
Then you go in.

225
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:31,820
OK.

226
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,860
You don't kiss him this time.

227
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,580
Don't kiss, right?

228
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,100
You will try to be provocative.

229
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,180
Tempting, provoking.

230
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,900
Use the feeling.
Caress here and there. The arm.

231
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
The whole arms.

232
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,980
Ah, understood?

233
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,580
I do.

234
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,900
OK.

235
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,620
So the team...

236
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:45,980
Ouch.

237
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,260
The make-up team come in.

238
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,940
Do some touch up.

239
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,950
Take care of the outfits.

240
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,060
Should I take off my shirt?

241
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,540
Focus. Don't forget that today...

242
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
we focus on the acting.

243
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,620
Thank you very much.

244
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Now let's start shooting.

245
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
OK.

246
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,620
NC. NC.

247
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,180
P' Bird, do I have to take the box out?

248
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,820
Come again?

249
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,580
Do I have to remove the box?

250
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,940
Was it in the shot?

251
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't think so.

252
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,100
If you don't see it, you don't have to remove it.

253
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
2, 1, action!

254
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,755
Oops!

255
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,711
Hottie. Hottie.

256
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,100
Let me post a picture.

257
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:13,688
Edit for me.

258
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,250
You want this? Bigger face?

259
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,140
Bigger face? Bigger face?

260
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,220
OK. OK. OK. OK.

261
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,940
Hey, you want this scene?

262
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:38,340
- Which scene?
- In the bedroom?

263
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes.

264
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:47,822
Nuea.

265
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:49,422
Huh!

266
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,222
We thank you very much for the past.

267
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:54,844
What's wrong, Toh?

268
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,100
Cut! So good.

269
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,580
Make up team! Touch up.

270
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:17,240
Well done! One take and pass!

271
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
You..

272
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Huh?

273
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,380
Haven't been posting much stories lately.

274
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,220
Because I didn't go anywhere,
only work and work.

275
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,700
Hmm, so you didn't see anyone?

276
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,220
Only this person.

277
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,780
If you're bored, you can see someone else.

278
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
And if I am not bored?

279
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Pan?

280
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,940
Have you ever thought about it for fun?

281
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,820
If we stop here,

282
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
how will it be.

283
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Stop what?

284
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Stop

285
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,180
looking for anyone else.

286
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,440
Just having the two of us like this.

287
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Why would you think that?

288
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,900
Well, we've talked, haven't we?
That our story ends in this room.

289
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:03,688
Sleep now.

290
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Get up.

291
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,066
(It’s here.)
HI HI Hello Hello Hello.

292
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,555
(Finally.)
HI HI Hello Hello Hello.

293
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,066
(I’m so excited.)
HI HI Hello Hello Hello.

294
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,933
(Dew, my baby.)
HI HI Hello Hello Hello.

295
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:44,888
(- P, my baby.
- I’m gonna faint.)

296
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:45,860
(- My baby!!!)
- He's so cute with that red bowtie.

297
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,100
(Their first event together this year.)
Welcome. All the press and the fans.

298
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,420
(Thank you, Coolza!)
Welcome. All the press and the fans.

299
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,380
(I’m giving away 200 baht)
Welcome. All the press and the fans.

300
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,260
(I’m gonna cry.)
Welcome. All the press and the fans.

301
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,940
(I missed them.)

302
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,540
(Will Love Trick get renewed?)
This is COOLZA.

303
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,260
(Where’s Nott and Pan?)
This is COOLZA.

304
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,933
(Where’s the event?)
This is COOLZA.

305
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:53,420
(This looks like their wedding.)
This is COOLZA.

306
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,688
(- I’m here to witness their love.
- When will Nott and Pan get on stage?)

307
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:56,300
(Coolza, you’re the best.)

308
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,940
(Can I still go to the event?)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

309
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,660
(He’s cute. I want him.)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

310
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,020
(What a cool event.)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

311
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,740
(Did you get our foot support?)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

312
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,420
(Since when the live started?)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

313
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,860
(Did Nott and Pan leave?)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

314
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,300
(P is handsome.)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

315
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,900
(I’ll drink Coolza until I get diabetes.)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

316
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,420

I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

317
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,860
(Who are they? I don’t know them.)
I, Sprite will take everyone to COOLZA
together, with P and Dew.

318
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:02,220
(Here for Nott and Pan.)

319
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,460
(P has gotten even more handsome.)

320
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,980
(Sharks bite, but I like you.)

321
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,340
(I’m jealous of those who get to go.)

322
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,700
(Nott and Pan?)

323
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,133
(There’s always Coolza in my fridge.)

324
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:05,900
(I’m here to observe.)

325
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,380
(They’re so cute.
Check out my teddy bear store.)

326
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,740
(Coolza, your event is always cool.)

327
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,180
(It’s hot in Chonburi.)

328
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,580
(My baby’s so cute.)

329

(Is this a Likay performance or what?)
Give us COOLZA. Group shot.

464
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,340
(Fight all you want, but business owners
get the last laugh and money.)

465
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,700
(That wasn’t BDSM. Are all BL fans stupid?)
How are we feeling?
To meet the legendary and the new gen.

466
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,380
(BL shows don’t have to contribute
anything to the community.)
How are we feeling?
To meet the legendary and the new gen.

467
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,820
(Do shows starring straight couples contribute
anything to the community?)
How are we feeling?
To meet the legendary and the new gen.

468
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,420
(If it weren’t for BL shows,
no one would’ve accepted you.)
How are we feeling?
To meet the legendary and the new gen.

469
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,300
(People are quiet when it comes to marriage equality
despite the popularity of BL shows.)
How are we feeling?
To meet the legendary and the new gen.

470
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,820
(BL fans, stop being stupid please.)

471
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,140
(Your community only has voice because of BL fans.)
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

472
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,900
(Can you take a screenshot? I can’t.)
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

473
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,380
(I don’t want BL shows. I want equality.)
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

474
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,660
(Nott and Pan’s fans,
can we do a get-together?)
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

475
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,460
(Who are they? I don’t know them.)
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

476
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,780
Alright. Next up, it's the interviewing time.

477
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,280
(Thank you for watching. Get ready for
our new flavour for Coolza. Soon.)

478
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:41,700
Is this event a battle of a shipped couple?

479
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm happy with them
that their efforts have paid off.

480
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,620
(These two couples declared war.)

481
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,060
Many people see Pan and Nott
to be the next Dew-P.

482
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:55,220
If we are the next gen,
then GEN 1 must be outdated.

483
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:58,510
(The second generation is here.)

484
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,060
(Say goodbye to the first generation?)

485
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,060
We are us. Do not compare us to the other.

486
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,060
Call it, a new era.

487
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,400
(A new era begins with
a new popular ship couple.)

488
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,380
I would like all my fans to please continue
to love these new gen for a long time.

489
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,140
Thank you very much P'P
for wishing us with your fans.

490
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,060
And I hope that our era

491
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,420
will last as long as how P'P and P'Dew did.

492
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:37,860
(The war has begun
for these brand ambassadors.)

493
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:42,733
(I’m a new Coolza member.
Nice to meet you.)

494
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,177
(P tagged you in a post.)

495
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,155
(Welcome a new member
to our Coolza home.)

496
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,660
(Next Break) I'm going to visit my mother-in-law.
I must have something with me.

497
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,700
There is no one in your house?

498
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,020
Your dad's pressure has gone up.
Your mother has been watching for two days.

499
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,511
(Sorry.
We’re out of stock for Coolza drinks.)

500
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,480
(Koon sent you a message.)

501
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,110
(Where are you, Pan?)

502
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,980
Did you tell me that I don't have work today?

503
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,810
It's really urgent.

504
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,190
Mr. Suthat is one of the executives of TTV.

505
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,350
He wants to meet you.

506
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,150
You're lucky that

507
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,730
I always have your clothes.

508
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,810
Thank you.

509
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
How do I look?

510
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Good!

511
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,230
Alright, Sai.

512
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Yes.

513
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,150
Nong Sai, I have an appointment with
Nong Pan today.

514
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,730
Pan, this is Sai.

515
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Hi.

516
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,650
Do you know her?

517
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,150
Khun Sai is an executive

518
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,020
of COPY B Company.

519
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,980
The biggest billboard producer in Thailand.

520
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,150
I have seen some of my ads.

521
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,060
I have to thank you very much.

522
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,520
I'm the one who have to thank you.

523
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,480
You are very famous now.

524
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,770
People have been contacting me to fight for you.

525
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,190
Thank you.

526
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,690
I'll have to go now.

527
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,500
OK. Bye-bye.

528
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Hello.

529
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,850
Hello, Mr. Suthat.

530
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,730
Please.

531
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,770
Thank you!

532
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,270
What do you want to have?

533
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,100
Seafood? Alaskan Crab?

534
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,650
No.

535
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,980
I think we have crab.

536
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,100
You don't like it?

537
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,230
Are you allergic to crab?

538
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,150
I think we avoid seafood

539
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,400
and have cold cut instead. Good idea?

540
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
You remembered!

541
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
As he said.

542
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,650
OK.

543
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,640
Handsome, talented,

544
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
and smart.

545
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,640
Do you like reading books?

546
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,770
This one likes to read very much.

547
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,400
Lot of books in the bedroom.

548
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,650
You are oveexaggerting.

549
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,230
Actually, I only read in my free time.

550
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,650
Good boy.

551
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,430
Both handsome and talented.

552
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm sorry, but you have an urgent call.

553
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,650
Well, I already told you
that I'm not taking any call today.

554
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,850
Well, this one is really urgent, I'm sorry.

555
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,730
Please excuse me. Sorry for this.

556
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,770
Not at all.

557
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you very much.

558
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,350
He's not talking about the contract.

559
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,940
Who's going to talk about the contract here?

560
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,840
You will have do it at his building.

561
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,440
Today he just wanna see you.

562
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:56,755
(Mom, do you want durians?
Mom, did you eat dinner?)

563
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,333
(Mom, I have a few day-offs.)

564
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,688
(I think TTV is signing me.)

565
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,177
(What’s up?)

566
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,844
(Just thinking about you.)

567
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,488
(What’s with the quick reply?)

568
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,577
(Was I supposed to wait
before I replied?)

569
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,577
(No, it’s just that my mom
didn't answer my texts.)

570
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,822
How is it going?

571
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,420
How many hours have you not replied?

572
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Umm.

573
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,850
It's been several days.

574
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,060
Are you free tomorrow?

575
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
I'll go pick you up.

576
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,844
Khun Chalerm sent this?

577
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,770
Yes.

578
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,640
Pharaoh is about to get a drama job.

579
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,770
So I asked him for a skin care kit.

580
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,980
Just an extra, I think

581
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,300
you don't have to do this much.

582
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Where are you going?

583
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,480
See Nott.

584
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
You go out with Nott often now.

585
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,170
Who said that he doesn't want
to be a shipped partner forever?

586
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
I did.

587
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,400
I will not be a shipped couple forever.

588
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,150
I'm going to be in the TV channel soon.

589
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Nong Pan,

590
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,650
Do you want something to eat?

591
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,690
I bought unsweetened soy milk for you.

592
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,850
It's okay, I'm leaving now.

593
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,230
Thank you.

594
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:05,022
You ready?

595
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,600
(Dew started a live broadcast.)

596
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Ooh.

597
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,400
Comments keep popping up.

598
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:34,480
(You’re cute.)

599
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,100
(You light up the world.)
I don't know if I can say this.

600
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,810
(Is TTV signing a new actor?)
I don't know if I can say this.

601
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,460
(All I see is cuteness.)
but TTV will launch.

602
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:36,660
(I want you all to myself.)
but TTV will launch

603
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,730
but TTV will launch

604
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
a new actor.

605
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,900
A signature shipped couple.
Anyway, don't forget to follow me.

606
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Ouch!

607
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,190
What is this?

608
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,730
Oh! Go away.

609
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,050
Get up.

610
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,911
Where to?

611
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Home.

612
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,310
Let's go.

613
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:01,950
Let's go.

614
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,060
Go.

615
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,020
Let's go.

616
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,650
Let's go.

617
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Shall we?

618
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
What is that?

619
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,770
Visiting my mother-in-law,

620
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,100
there must be some gifts.

621
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Thank you.

622
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,520
What are you doing?

623
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Go away.

624
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,440
Man,

625
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:43,980
Pan,

626
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,670
they're messed up.

627
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Oi.

628
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Complaints.

629
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,270
Just a little mess.

630
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
So.

631
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
No one at home?

632
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
Do you have the keys?

633
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,650
Well, they just changed the key.

634
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,310
Let me ask mom.

635
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,730
Yes!

636
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh, Pan?

637
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,730
Uh.

638
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Good morning, uncle.

639
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,650
Did you see his parents?

640
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,930
Oh, you brought your lover.

641
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,350
Do you see my father and mother?

642
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,850
He ain't your faggot couple, ain't he?

643
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,150
Right?

644
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,350
Grandpa, we are actors.

645
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,900
We can play any role.

646
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,730
We can play a monk.

647
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,770
A lady boy.

648
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,500
Or a thief that hits an old man's head?

649
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,650
Ouch!

650
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,250
So do you see my father and mother?

651
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,190
Oh, they are at the hospital.

652
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,710
Your father's pressure has gone up.

653
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,900
You mom went to look over.

654
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,350
He didn't tell you?

655
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Oh!

656
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Thank you, uncle.

657
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,100
Would you like some fruits?

658
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,770
Yeah, I can take it.

659
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh!

660
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Two bags.

661
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:24,200
Do you want them?

662
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:25,844
If you insist.

663
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,622
Give me.

664
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:29,666
Bye now.

665
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,066
(What’s happened to Dad? Where are you?)

666
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,060
(I’m home.)

667
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,777
(Dad’s fine. Don’t come.)

668
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:10,288
(There are people. It’s embarrassing.)

669
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,933
(Mom: Take care of yourself, Pan.
Listen to Koon.)

670
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,022
(Mom: I can’t give you anymore money.)

671
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,311
(- I’ll make sure to earn enough for you.
- I’ll wait for your series.)

672
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,180
(Next Break)
At least you know

673
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,510
that if you have no one else,

674
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,850
you still have me.

675
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,560
Can I stay with you tonight?

676
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,810
Are you sure?

677
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,020
Your dad's blood pressure has gone high.
Your mom went to watch.

678
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Didn't he tell you?

679
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:25,550
Pan. Pan. Pan.

680
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,930
Thank you very much for today.

681
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,090
Tell me, how are you today, baby?

682
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,970
You don't have to call me that.
There are no fans around.

683
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,720
Well, thank you very much for today.

684
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Are you tired?

685
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,090
Tired? No. I had so much fun.

686
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,850
Plus it's worth it.

687
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,550
What's so worth it?

688
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:12,550
It's worth it that now you know that
even if you don't have anyone,

689
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:14,930
you still have me.

690
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,850
Believe me,

691
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,680
that I will be the person who is not mean to you.

692
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,300
Be patience. You will be a big actor soon.

693
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,930
Then your mom will be proud of you.

694
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,800
She'd brag to the whole district
until you're so bored.

695
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,090
Well, good night, take a rest.

696
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,890
Bye.

697
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,090
Are you OK?

698
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,430
Can I stay with you tonight?

699
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
What are you waiting for?

700
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,260
I love you.

701
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,640
If we just stop now,

702
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:25,550
and don't look for anyone.
Just us like this and so on.

703
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,970
Are you sure?

704
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:27,400

Our good news with a new actor debut.

706
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,890
Wow. Wow. Wow.

707
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,220
Well, let's start, shall we?

708
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,790
First one, Khun Nott!

709
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,720
The BL series actor

710
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,930
has signed a contract with TTV.

711
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:59,390
Woo!

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,930

You're in trouble too, aren't you?

716
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,750
If you don't want to stay, go.

717
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,600
I want to know if the series go on without me,
how many people will be watching.

718
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,850
I used to see you
as a boat to get me forward,

719
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,970
but today if that boat is useless.

720
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,100
I just don't have to keep it.

721
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,720
I must be wrong to have
fallen in love with you.
