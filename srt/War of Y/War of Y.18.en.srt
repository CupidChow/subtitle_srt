Okay kids. That's enough.

10
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:23,876
Let's go eat something.

11
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,607
Today we have curry noodle soup too.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,266
- Curry noodle soup?
- Yes.

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,577
Hurry and go.
Otherwise it'll all be gone before you get there.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,155
You guys can go first.

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,153
Actually I'm spicy enough today.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,083
Oh! What the hell?

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,911
- Lets go.
- Lets go eat.

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,733
- Lets go everyone.
- You can take the lead.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,288
Whats with him? Just let him be.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,244
Hey.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,022
You came together?

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,911
Yeah.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,066
Fern's motorbike broke down.

24
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,177
So I went to pick her up.

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,555
Next time you can tell me.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,866
I can go pick you up.

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,377
No need to trouble Achi.

28
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:20,792
It's okay.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,644
I like to get coffee near there anyway.

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,866
Is the coffee there that good?

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,600
Oh! And I was waiting
to have coffee with you.

32
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,266
So...

33
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,666
You guys have already eaten together.

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,311
We already ate.

35
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,377
But we can eat with you again.

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,711
- Okay?
- You're so good at eating.

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,688
I'm greedy.

38
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,366
(Law of feelings)

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,709
Are you feeling tense about the scene?

40
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,622
Yeah.

41
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:03,409
I'm scared I won't do well
and waste other people's time.

42
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,733
You can do it the best.

43
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,733
I know I can.

44
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,266
But how will it come out?

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,311
No matter how it comes out.

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,822
I'm still your buddy anyway.

47
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,355
Don't be stressed.

48
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,088
If this was a Y series,

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,044
I would've pulled you close and kissed you already.

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,644

New, New. I think we should change the
camera lens to get a better shot.

66
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,377
You can do whatever you want.

67
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,466
Hey, camera operators.

68
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,511
Both of you, let's change the camera lens.

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,266
Camera 1, you do wide frame, keep it wide
And the other one, do the narrow frame.

70
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,577
Focus on the actors. Do it properly.

71
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,222
(Incoming call: BOY TTV)

72
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,333
Hello.

73
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:42,177
Hi New. Heave you seen the news?
The hashtag about banning you is going viral.

74
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,355
I've already seen it.

75
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,822
What happened there?
Why aren't you doing the task you're assigned to?

76
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,800
It was during break time.

77
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:52,696
Stop making excuses.

78
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,622
I'm not making any excuses
But I'm having troubles too.

80
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,088
Troubles?

81
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,688
Then don't direct.

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,800
It's not like that.

83
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,377
I'm not troubled because of directing.

84
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:11,888
Then do a better job, I don't want to
see anymore news like this coming out.

85
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,866
Okay. I will do better.

86
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,200
Most.

87
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,066
Yes?

88
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,577
If you believe you can do it
You'll be able to do it.

89
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,511
You must believe in yourself.

90
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,977
About your safety, don't worry about it.

91
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,111
- We have the medical team here to support.
- Okay.

92
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,155
If you can't hold out any longer, just stop.

93
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:00,444
Don't force yourself. Okay?

94
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,133
- Sure.
- Good luck.

95
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,155
Ready? Alright. 3

96
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,933
2 And action.

97
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,244
Cut and print.

98
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,022
Hey. He already said cut.

99
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Most.

100
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,666
- Most.
- Most.

101
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,955
- Most.
- Most. Hey!

102
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,288
Most. Come here, this way.

103
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,244
- Is it done already?
- Yeah it is.

104
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,866
You scared me there. Come up.

105
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,844
Jeeze.

106
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,177
Ugh!

107
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,911
I thought you drowned in the water.

108
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,088
You were so good today.

109
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,822
I told you that you can do it.

110
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,333
I could do because I had you as my encouragement.

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,711
- Stop it.
- Oh.

112
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,366
- What about me?
- Aren't we your support?

113
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,755
- What about me!
- Good job son, you were very good.

114
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,888
- It's done already.
- Let's change the scene. Next scene.

115
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's go.

116
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,311
Come on. Get up.

117
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,955
Change the scene.

118
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,459
Let's go.

119
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,955
Help me up.

120
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,709
You two. We have a little problem.

121
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,577
It's... I want to add something.

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,377
Right now, the characters have
just passed through a crisis.

123
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,977
And it's a turning point for both of them.

124
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,333
They start to realize how
important the other is to each of them.

125
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,422
But in the script, there is just conversation
It doesn't express anything.

126
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,755
I think we should let the characters like...

127
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,577
Let them do what they want to do
And see what we can explore from there.

128
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,200
You can do it right?

129
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,022
- Okay?
- Okay New. Sure.

130
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,488
Come on.

131
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,022
Get ready.

132
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,022
Can I get some smoke?

133
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:12,926
Alright.

134
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,800
That's enough. Let's start.

135
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:15,834
Three

136
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,222
two, and...

137
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,755
Action.

138
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,155
How are you feeling now?

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,155
Do you know...

140
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,266
when I was underwater...

141
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,955
what I saw?

142
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,155
I saw you.

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,955
It made me realize...

144
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,866
Even if this world is a horrible place.

145
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,911
You will never be like that for me.

146
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Let out the emotions.

147
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,488
That's it.

148
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
You did a good job today.

149
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,400
Good job?
Really?

150
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,866
Yeah.

151
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,466
If I did well, don't I get a reward?

152
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,933
What reward?

153
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,755
A National award?

154
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,511
Y series actors like us can only dream of those.

155
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,177
Can I get a reward for doing well in the scene today?

156
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,622
Can I?

157
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,533
Stop fooling around.

158
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,266
I'm just kidding.

159
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,200
This is more than enough.

160
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,800
Can I get a power charge?

161
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:08,876
You can come out now.

162
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,088
Is Most okay?

163
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,377
Yeah, he's fine now.

164
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,466
He must be feeling better now.

165
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,466
That's good
He had all the hard scenes today.

166
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,688
Are you worried about him?

167
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,377
Umm. Yeah I am.

168
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,044
What about me?

169
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,800
Aren't you worried about me?

170
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,200
Of course I am.

171
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,955
How was it today? Are you tired?

172
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,111
I'm so tired.

173
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,800
Can I get a power charge from my girlfriend?

174
00:15:58,577 --> 00:15:59,200
Yes you can.

175
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,044
Let's go.

176
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,333
Be careful.

177
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:19,266
Is it okay?

178
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,222
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

179
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:25,777
Go

180
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,889
(#Ypoll)
(Acting as lovers on screen
can make you feel it off screen too)

181
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:31,333

(1. They can.)
(2. They can't. It depends on feelings)

182
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,733
(Next Break)
The coffee shop you were telling me about...

183
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,066
is this one?

184
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,222
I just came to buy coffee.

185
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,066
I saw that it was close to Fern's condo
So I invited her to come.

186
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,810
Hey, did you wait long?

187
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:16,444
Here.

188
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,555
- I ordered you your favorite drink.
- Thanks man.

189
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,888
You came alone?

190
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
Yeah. I already had plans with you.

191
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:29,777
Why would I bring my boyfriend?

192
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,044
If he came he would just annoy me.

193
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,555
Are you still dating the same person?

194
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,240
Yes, the same one. Why?

195
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,070
No one except for Kong can tolerate me.

196
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:45,155
Most.

197
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,088
How's your Y series going?

198
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,577
How does it feel to be a shipped couple?

199
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,600
It's okay.

200
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,333
New.

201
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,422
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

202
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,955
When you and Kong were flirting.

203
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,466
How did it feel?

204
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:24,622
Huh?

205
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,380
Hello Fern. What would you like today?
Your usual?

206
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,311
- The same.
- Sure and what about you?

207
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:35,400
Can I eat you?

208
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,288
You're nuts!

209
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,140
- Wait a second. I'll be back.
- Sure.

210
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:45,200
Hey.

211
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:49,800
Stop playing.

212
00:18:55,822 --> 00:19:00,044
The coffee shop you were
telling me about... is this the one?

213
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:01,755
Yeah.

214
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,022
So why are you here together?

215
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,955
I came to get some coffee.

216
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:17,800
I saw that it was close to Fern's condo
So I invited her to come.

217
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,600
I didn't know you were close by.

218
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,266
Then ask in the Line group next time.

219
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,140
So I can let you know where I am.

220
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,911
If I invited would you be able to come?

221
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:29,755
Hmm?

222
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:32,088
Why not?

223
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:33,711
Hey Most.

224
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:42,333
Yeah.

225
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,355
I'm going back to my friend.

226
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,311
Okay.

227
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:58,777
Most. Wait.

228
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:01,844
Well...

229
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,630
Me and Achi...

230
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,222
It's...?

231
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,511
Since we are together.

232
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,911
Let's make some content.

233
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:16,444
Sure.

234
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,488
Hold on.

235
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,288
Come on

236
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:28,150

00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,822
"SS The Series!"

238
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:51,933
We're here my lady.

239
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:55,800
If my driving was good
Please give me a 5 star rating.

240
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:57,911
Yeah.

241
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:05,177
Get home safely.

242
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,533
Bye bye.

243
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,466
Bye.

244
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,690
Hey, it hurts.

245
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,050
Achi, sit properly.

246
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,333
Its hurting.

247
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,030
You should hurry and go.

248
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,822
There are lots of mosqitos here
You'll get bitten.

249
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,133
Yes maam.

250
00:21:58,863 --> 00:21:59,863
Ouch! That hurts.

251
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,133
I'm hurt too.

252
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,570
What's hurting?

253
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:05,590
Stop it.

254
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,190
What are you doing?

255
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:09,866
Most.

256
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,155
Most!

257
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,911
Damn it New. You got here quickly.

258
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,410
I didn't have to stop and
drop off anyone like you.

259
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you for driving my car back.

260
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:39,466
Hey Most.

261
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:42,088
I think you're head over heels.

262
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:44,066
What do you mean?

263
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:47,244
You left your car to go drop someone else.

264
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:48,911
Tell me.

265
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,244
Who do you like?

266
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:56,777
The guy or the girl.

267
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,267
You don't have to think too much.

268
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,244
If you already feelings for one of them,

269
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,755
they'll keep growing.

270
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,940
You just have to accept that you really like them.

271
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:19,120
Love is all the same
There’s no difference.

272
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:20,610
Don't think too much.

273
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,977
Don't be stressed.

274
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,555
Hey, why are you making that face?

275
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,622
You want some?

276
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:32,330
Take it. Take it all
What are you waiting for?

277
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,900
Take it. Let's get drunk.

278
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:38,060
Yeah. So you don't over-think.

279
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,600
Good.

280
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,000
Drink till you are drunk.

281
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,444
Yeah. And stop thinking too much.

282
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,066
Are you okay?

283
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,288
Of course I am.

284
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,488
If we want to win, we gotta do it.

285
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,844
It's good that you think that way.

286
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,933
I heard you crying when you were on the phone.

287
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:08,733
Why are you making yourself even more tired?

288
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,177
Honestly.

289
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,866
I think you don't need to play the game.

290
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,090
You should just do your best.

291
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:16,533
That's it.

292
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,200
You can easily win the competition.

293
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,177
I told you that you can do it.

294
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,710
Because I have you as my encouragement.

295
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,977
If I did well, don't I deserve a reward?

296
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,466
Whatever I'm like,
I'll be myself with you.

297
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,511
And you need to be yourself with me.

298
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,177
If you need anything you need to tell me.

They are here too.

Hey. Never mind.

I can do it myself.

You can keep leaning on me in the car.

00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,111
I'm your #littlebear too.

484
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,777
- Little bear?
- Yeah.

485
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,350
If I strangle you, will you die?

486
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,000
Hmm.

487
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,111
Yon can try!

488
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,911
Let's go everyone.

489
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:41,466
Give Most and Achi some privacy.

490
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,800
Come on.

491
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,111
I really want to th...

492
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,622
It's my pleasure.

493
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:15,825
Anything for you.

494
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,481
- Here..
- It hurts.

495
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,266
Here, strangle.

496
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:27,881
- You really want to do it?
- Of course not.

497
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,311
If you really did it then
what would happen?

498
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:33,948
(#Ypoll)
(Actors get a job because of?)

499

(#Ypoll)
(1. Talent 2. Publicity)

500
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,911
(Next Break)
Let's go. We have other shows to go on.

501
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,600
You have been on 10 shows already?

502
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:44,121
But still only a number 5 trend.

503
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,814
You guys are good.

504
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,311
Oh. Achi. Most.

505
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,222
Oh hey.

506
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,900
Congratulations on getting getting to
number one on trending.

507
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,888
Remember this moment well.

508
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,066
Come on. Lets go.

509
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,311
- I'm tired.
- Of course you are.

510
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,666
We've been on over 10 shows today.

511
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,777
Wow.

512
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,387
You guys have been on 10 shows already?

513
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,755
But still only a number 5 trend.

514
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,444
You guys are good.

515
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,777
Let's go.

516
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,622
We have other shows to get to.

517
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,266
What's the hurry?

518
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,666
- We have to go on another show.
- Really?

519
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,740
Better luck next time.

520
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,980
See you later.

521
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,133
See you.

522
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:14,588
Why are you so heated?

523
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:16,533
Calm down.

524
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:21,333
How can I be calm?

525
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,485
Didn't you see how they looked at us?

526
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:26,581
They were looking down on us.

527
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:28,995
(Who's alone? Looking for a friend #Achi'slittlebear)
(#EarthKorn anyone here? I'm at the front)

528
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,875
(What time will they come out?
I'm rushing there #Achi'slittlebear)

529
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,715
(Where is the fan gathering?
Can someone tell me #Achi'slittlebear)

530
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,455
(#P'sStars I'm at the front with the board)

531
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,169
(Everyone please move for the staff.
Don't block the door #Achi'slittlebear)

532
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,822
(So excited. Bought new lens just for this #Achi'slittlebear)

533
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:37,222
We are really sorry P for bringing you through the fire exit.

534
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,511
There are a lot of FC's downstairs.

535
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,133
Are you okay to go down through the fire exit?

536
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,600
Sure. No problem.

537
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,333
Then lets to.

538
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,755
Wait. Everyone.

539
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,266
Take a picture and post on your social media.

540
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:54,355
Thank your FC for coming.

541
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,400
Sure.

542
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:58,974
- One moment please.
- Certainly.

543
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,622
Oh! What are you all doing here.

544
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,911
Really sorry Pia.

545
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,622
There are a lot of FC's downstairs
So we have to use the fire exit.

546
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,644
- Excuse me.
- Please.

547
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,688
Sorry again for causing trouble.

548
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,000
No problem at all.

549
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,688
Excuse me.

550
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,466
Sorry.

551
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:32,213
See you.

552
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:37,444
I'm really sorry.

553
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,888
We just have a lot of FC's.

554
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,755
Bye Pia.

555
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,177
Bye.

556
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,040
See you guys later.

557
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,444
- Do they really have that many FC's?
- As many as we can see.

558
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,133
They're trending on twitter too.

559
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,155
Let's go Pia. Don't waste time.

560
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,168
(Achipisit: Thank you for today.
I promise to not disappoint anyone #SSTheSeries)

561
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:11,358
(Most: Whose Fc is that, so cute. Got us
trending right after the live ended.
Three claps for you. Thank you so much #SSTheSeries)

562
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,481
(Earth: Thank you guys! And please stay tuned for #SSTheSeries)

563
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,355
(Korn: Thank you for watching the live
and thank you for coming to see us #SSTheSeries)

564
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:48,674
(Fern: Are you tired?)

565
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:51,507
(Fern: Have you gotten home?)

566
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,111
Hey. Who are you chatting with?

567
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,088
Thank you very much for today.

568
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,800
For coming to drop me off.

569
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,844
No worries.

570
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,511
I told you.

571
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,222
I do it willingly.

572
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,577
Oh, are you going to go back already?

573
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,666
So you can go rest.

574
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,666
You use me and now you're sending me away?

575
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,296
Not like that.

576
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,577
If you want to stay. Let's go to the room.

577
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,044
Then...

578
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,899
Lets go and play upstairs for a while.

579
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,955
Play what?

580
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,111
What are you going to play?

581
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,800
Don't think too much.

582
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,081
If you already have feelings with someone.

583
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,044
they'll keep growing.

584
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:55,355
You just have to accept that you really like that person.

585
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,977
It's just you and me here now.

586
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,044
I want to kiss you.

587
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,177
Can I kiss you?

588
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,933
I've never kissed a guy before.

589
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
If it wasn't for acting.

590
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,111
Neither have I.

591
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,570
But I really want to kiss you.

592
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,800
Can I?

593
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:44,172
You can try!

594
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,044
Now that you've tried it, do you like it?

595
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:42,207
(Recent calls: Achi (52))

596

if you have to be quiet about it?)

(1. Yes 2. No)

598

(Next Week)
Fern, why didn't you cheer?

599
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,355
Your role is to be an FC.

600
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,133
Not a jealous wife like this.

601
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:00,867
You should stop being mean to me.

602
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,577
You got me and now you're going to leave me?

603
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,755
Fern is acting weird these days.

604
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,333
It's like she's jealous.

605
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,504
Jealous of who.

606
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,577
I'm never like this

607
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,377
I don't know what happened today.

608
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,022
Me and Most were just doing that for content.

609
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,063

How can we compete with other couples?
