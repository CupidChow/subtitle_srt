00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,111
that from now on

157
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,066
I will focus only on work.

158
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,377
And not disappoint anyone.

(Detective Entertainment)

163
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,222
Everyone. The news
that we've been following up closely.

164
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,222
To sum up, Fern wasn't born a woman
and she isn't pregnant.

165
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,888
We have to believe what Achi says.

166
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,666
And they've already had a press conference.

167
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,866
They've stated that Fern is no longer part of the series.

168
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,444
We have to wait and watch what happens next.
Sending support to the team.

169
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,977
That's all for today. We're taking our leave now.

170
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,044
See you again next time. Bye.

171
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Have we broken up?

172
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,000
When were you going to tell me?

173
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,688
I should've been the first to know.

174
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:33,222
And where did you disappear to?

175
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,533
I didn't go anywhere at all.

176
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:39,622
I was in the same place all along.

177
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,088
Did you even try looking for me?

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,088
And how did you know?

179
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
In the past,

180
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,288
Was it only for content?

181
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,577
Not everything is about content.

182
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,755
Like me being your FC

183
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
That wasn't a lie.

184
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,466
Come to think of it.

185
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,222
What you said is true.

186
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,177
When you said I know.

187
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,288
I think it's true.

188
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Because...

189
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,020
We are both the same.

190
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Thank you.

191
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,288

193

Two. And.

194

Action.

195
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,660
You were scared it won't be real.

196
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,711
So you tricked me into loving you?

197
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,555
Who's more important?

198
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,155
Work is the most important.

199
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,088
Okay. Let's cut.

200
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Most, are you okay?

201
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,133
Okay. Then.

202
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's change the scene.

203
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,444
We can shoot this another day.

204
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,933
Okay?

205
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,311
- Hey. Don't worry.
- Chill.

206
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:08,111
Don't think too much.

207
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,844
Okay.

We can shoot again some other day.

What about you?

312

I had my answer from the moment they asked.

313
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,155
Since when did you become so good at saying sorry?

315

00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,200
Most importantly.

438
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:37,222
Thank you Achi.

439
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,000
If not for you.

440
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,533
I wouldn't be here today.

441
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:46,980
I want to tell Achi that, you've been.

442
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,000
(Oh my)
(I'm crying)
(I missed these two so much)
I want to tell Achi that, you've been.

443
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,155
(Do a show together please)

444
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:51,177
(Most and Achi forever)
My motivator.

445
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,488
(Please do a season 2)

446
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:53,622
(I'm weak for his accent)
Pushing me.

447
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:54,266
(Is Achi crying?)

448
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,888
(I want to hug him tight)
(Can I still go to the award show?)
Getting me closer to my dream every day.

449
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,066
Thank you.

450
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Thank you very much Achi.

451
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:05,711
And this award.

452
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Also belongs to you.

453
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,311
(I can tell they love each other)
(I'm crying)
(Their hashtag reached no. 1)

454
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:10,240
Achi

455
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
(I love #SStheseries the most)
(I've been his fan since the beginning)
Even though...

456
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,466
(I've listened to his music. It's good)
(The Achi who allegedly knocked up a girl?)
(Make a new series for them, P)
Sing Swim The Series was my first series.

457
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:26,530
(I'm crying)
(He won but he looks sad)
(I didn't know him before this)

458
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:27,844
(Love his northern accent)
It was filled with happiness.

459
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:29,555
(Please marry me so I can listen to you speak every day)
(I'm his fan now)

460
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:31,133
Filled with good memories.

461
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,355
(I want to hug him)
(Love you)

462
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:33,733
And great experiences.

463
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,710
(Is he retiring from acting or what?)
(I went to school with him. He was lovely)

464
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:40,600
(I'm crying like a baby)
(What?)
(Eh?)
(Does that mean...)
But now I want to grow as a musician.

465
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:44,600
(There will be no season 2?)
(What about our season 2?)
(They'll replace him?)
(What?)

466
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,911
If I have the chance.

467
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:46,400
(Most!)
(I don't like this)

468
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Next year...

469
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:49,844
I would like to come receive an award again.

470
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,022
(This is unfortunate but I respect his decision)

471
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:52,733
(What about Achi?)
(Did he just retire from acting?)
As the singer for one of the series.

472
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,960
(I'll look forward to your new music)

473
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
(I'm speechless)
Thank you.

474
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:58,111
(Go if you want to)
(Now everyone is shocked)

475
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,000
(Now it's sad)
(I'm sad)
(I didn't expect it to be this dramatic)
(I can't watch this anymore)
And finally the award that everyone has been waiting for.

476
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,044
(Will there be more surprise?)
(Who will win the biggest award?)
(I'm watching this for the first time)

477
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,666
(War of Y should've been nominated too)
(Which award is this again?)
(I'm exhausted)
Who is the greatest of Y actors?

478
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,666
(Gus and Bew's fans, are you still here?)

479
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,930
(the CG is good)
(Trend the hashtag on twitter please)
The name of the winners is now in my hands.

480
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,600
(International fans can't watch?)

481
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,860
(It's time for the Greatest Y)
(It's coming)
(They're announcing it earlier this year)
(Fingers crossed)
(I want Punn to win)
(The biggest award)

482
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,060
(Will he win again)
(Can we still vote?)
(After this, I'm going to bed)
(For Y Series)

483
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,111
(Let's gooo)
(Twitter is on fire)
(Someone saw Fern. She went to an interview)
(A lot of good actors this year)
(Dew is cute)
(The presenter is cute)
(His suit looks itchy)

(What can expect from this kind of award show?)
(Oh my)
(What's this?)
(Oh my)
From Mafia Baby Season 1 & 2.

486
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,311
(Who's Nott?)
(Nott as in Nott and Punn?)
(He still gets nominated?)
Thanks for all the chances I've gotten

487
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:47,130
(But I thought he left the Y industry?)
(This is very confusing)
(Punn and Nott are back)

488
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:47,844
Achi.

489
00:34:47,844 --> 00:34:48,288

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,511
From Sing Swim The Series.

492
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,111
(Why did he get nominated?)
(I wonder what would Fern say about this?)
(I heard he's a sissy)
(Achi has the best performance this year)
The rising actor

493
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,488
(His big brother is hot)
is also one of the nominess.

494
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
(I met him in person. He's lovely)

495
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,155
P Atichon.

497
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,333
(What?)
The role that is still on everyones mind.

498
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,466
(P again?)
(He's the best Y actors)
Bringing him into our nominee list once again.

499
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,755
(P is winning this)

500
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:22,888
And the winner for 13th Y Galaxy,
The Greatest Y award goes to.

501
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,720
(Let P win, please)

502
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,044
(P is everywhere)
P Atichon,

503
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:30,977
(I want Dew to give him the award)
(He went above and beyond with this)
(His fans are rich so this doesn't surprise me)
(See?)

504
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,340
Congratulations.

505
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,666
(Twitter is on fire)
(And that's what you call legend)
Congratulations.

506
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,860
Wow, I want a hug too.

507
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,377
(He won and he didn't even play a Y role this year)
(He did a Y series once
and the world decides to give him all awards)
(They're hugging)
Wow, I want a hug too.

508
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,066
(Dew, come back)
(I'm having goosebumps)
(My god)
You stay back here, Let them be.

509
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,711
(They hugged!)
Congratulations.

510
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:51,710
(They're my comfort couple)
(He swept everything this year)

511
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:56,960
(I bet his house is full of awards)
(But it's getting tiring, don't you think?)
(If your fans are rich, you win, plain and simple)
(Stop calling it the "Greatest" award if it's fan-voted)

512
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,333
(Dew gave him the award)
Thank you for the award and the great honour.

513
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,560
(He's forever in my heart)

514
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,355
(I want to see them together in a show)
(Will TTV let Dew star in a Y series?)
Even though this is my third time here.

515
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:03,644
(But they're famous, undoubtedly)

516
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:04,733
I'm still very excited.

517
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,730
(Achi deserved it more)
(So, you win if you get the most votes?)
(I'm with you all the way, P)

518
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,680
(He won three years in a row?)
(And he should continue to win for another ten years! Love you, P)

519
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Do you all know?

520
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,311
(What's wrong with votes when the award
is for popularity?)
(He's so handsome)

521
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:12,777
When I'm stand here.

522
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:13,640
(Rich and handsome!)
(My favorite son-in-law)

523
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
What do I see?

524
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,600
I see new stars.

525
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,888
Old stars.

526
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,816
If you don't wanna stay, then leave.

527
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,155
Stop thinking that you are the best.

528
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,933
There are people out there
who are greater and better than you.

529
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,360
Some are still sitting in the same chair.

530
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,777
Some have been replaced.

531
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:37,244
I see the crews, the managers.

532
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,244
Who work behind the success of many shows.

533
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,600
Do you all know me and Toon...

534
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,444
Never signed a contract?

535
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,720
Our contract is based on trust.

536
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,711
Thank you both for being with us.

537
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,977
Oh.

538
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,400
I see new stars with passion to work in the industry.

539
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,822
I want to decided my own fate.

540
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,866
Not let it be decided by just anyone.

541
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,066
(He said it best)
(That's why he's CEO of Pioneer)
That they pretend to be someone they're not.

542
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,066
What I want to tell everyone is...

543
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:15,222
this industry is beautiful.

544
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:17,955
But each individual...

545
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,977
(P, you've grown a lot this year)
(We should dub him the president of Y series)
is also beautiful in their own way.

546
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,600
(The most touching award show!)

547
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Therefore...

548
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
(He never disappoints)

549
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,622
Love yourself.

550
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,520
(He's so real for this)
(I'm so proud of you)

551
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
(You're right, baby)
And one day.

552
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
(He's been doing this for so long
He knows everything)

553
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,911
People will love you.

554
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,377
Actually for me,
The entertainment industry is just the same like any other.

555
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,288
We all have responsibilities have duties we need to do.

556
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:49,920
Some people can stay for long.

557
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,911
But some come and go.

558
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,555
There are dark sides.

559
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:59,000
And it hurts us a lot.

560
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,155
But it also gives happiness.

561
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,733
And gives motivation for many people.

562
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,044
I'm not surprised why people love it here.

563
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:13,080
Before going.

564
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,333
I want to announce that.

565
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,750
(I'm on my third tissue box!)

566
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,840
(I love how Dew looks at him)
(I'm your fan forever, P)
I do not want to be nominated for The Greatest Y again.

567
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:22,422
(Oh my)
(I'm not surprised)
(Is he for real?)
To give a chance to the new stars out there.

568
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,555
And lastly.

569
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:33,622
I have a surprise for everyone.

570
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,200
(I almost had a heart attack)
(Seriously?)

571
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,644
(Is this a joke? Are we supposed to laugh?)
Please, let's watch the pre-recorded video together.

572
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:41,577
(At least it will be interesting next year)
(He doesn't want to be nominated because
there isn't enough space for more awards home)
(What surprise now?)
(This year is full of surprises)
(I think I have a headache)

573
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:42,711
(Enough surprise, please)
(Reporters will have a hard time tomorrow)

574
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,155
The coma case patient.

575
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,200
(What)
(What's this?)

576
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
His mother wants to pull him off life-support.

577
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,888
(Is that Dew?)

578
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:50,777
(It's Dew's voice)
(Is that Dew?)
But his boyfriend wants to keep him alive.

579
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:51,480
(Dew and who?)

580
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,422
(What are they doing at the shrine?)
(I'm confused)
If only we had equal marriage rights,

581
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,177
(I'm holding my breath)
(Maybe this is...)
This would have never have happened.

582
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,066
(Oh my)
(What is this?)
(P and Dew?)
(P and Dew, right?)
Those who make the rules,
They only think that...

583
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
(They're in a new show together?)
A marriage bill

584
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,755
(Mom!)
(I'm dead)
Is the same.

585
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,155
(I've read the novel this is based on)
(The novel is famous)
(They're at it again)
That's why we are behind...

586
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,000
(Are they for real?)
(They didn't have to attack me like this)
It's almost the same.

587
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,840
(He'll break twitter with this)
(This woke up the BL fan inside me)

588
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,044
(They produced it themselves too)
Listen to me Ton.

589
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:09,000
(Oh, this is fun)

590
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,266
We can be disappointed.

591
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:12,480
(This is insane)
(I love this)
(Now everyone is shocked)

592
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,000
(I'm back on this ship, guys)
(They're back for the throne)
But don't lose hope.

593
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:18,170
(He won't be nominated for "The Greatest Y"
but he will take home different awards)
(They'll win for this next year)
(I want to watch this already)
(This is crazy)
(P and Dew, you're so rude for this)
(I've read the novel)
(Love Truck: Doctor, I Brought You Some Love)

594
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,170
(The novel is so good)
(People will turn it into a drama)
(Love Truck: Doctor, I Brought You Some Love)

595
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,170
(But I thought the author said
there wouldn't be a TV show for the novel?)
(And it will air during prime time!)
(Coming soon on TTV
after the nightly news)

596
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,170
(A BL show during prime time!)
(They used to hate it so much.
Now they're airing it during prime time?)
(This is so funny)
(Coming soon on TTV
after the nightly news)

597
00:39:40,622 --> 00:39:44,130
(P Atichi refused to receive
more nominations for the Greatest Y Award)

598
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,288
(TTV's new BL show starring P and Dew
will air during prime time)

599
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,800
(1. #PandDew 2. #PAtichon 3.Love Truck Is Now a Series
4. #YGalaxy 5. #I'm your star, P)

600
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,960
Y series directors these days
don't care about plot.

601
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Is it true?

602
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,422
Just kissing and taking off clothes are fine.

603
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,000
- Congratulations with the Greatest Y award.
- Thanks Dew.

604
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,666
Even you've seen what this industry wants.

605
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,400
It's not talent or hardwork.

606
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:39,840
It just wants glamour.

607
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,866
Whatever that takes it higher.

608
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:44,888
The world is bad.

609
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
But you know right?

610
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:49,444
That I will never do that to you.

611
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,155
What the hell is wrong with you?
I don't understand.

612
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,533
- You are already the center of attention.
- It's correct that you don't understand.

613
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,280
You are not in the same position as me.

614
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,088
Whatever Koon did, I don't agree with it.

615
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:05,155
If you want any help, you can tell me

616
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:06,466
I will help you.

617
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,133
The faker it is, the more juicy it is,.

618
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,666
The more people like it, right?

619
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,355
So here it is.

620
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,711
Who said this job was easy?

621
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,000
I really want them to come and try it.

622
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:17,533
We have to be happy for others.

623
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,066
Even though we are crying inside.

624
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:21,422
So much pressure.

625
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,955
Even though you fake it to make money.

626
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,622
Do you know, you ruined my life.
Damn it.

627
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,600
You can't even sing properly.
Getting me scolded by my boss every day.

628
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,888
It's a competition. Lock or not lock, it's the same.

629
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:36,488
There are so many ways.

630
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,466
For them to get what they want.

631
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,844
Am I ready to be your idol. I think...

632
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,911
It depends on whose Idol I'm being.

633
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,311
If it means being an idol for people here.

634
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,155
Then I must know how to fight obstacles.

635
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,755
Then I can't be your idol.

636
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,400
Why can't we be in a relationship?

637
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,222
You are a Y series actor right.
Won't it be too selfish for Korn?

638
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,200
You are here to be an idol.
To inspire others.

639
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,720
But in the end, you guys act like this.

640
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,955
How can you be inspiration for other people?

641
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,711
Sometimes we need to force ourselves to do things.
In order to reach our goals.

642
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,200
No one would be so lucky.
To get to do thing they want to.

643
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,266
Let's do our best with this.

644
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,511
Let the world know, that you.

645
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,320
Can stand here. It's your place.

646
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,155
Let me tell you a trick.

647
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,955
When acting.

648
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,666
You need to be reborn.

649
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,444
You are not you.

650
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,133
You have to leave yourself behind.

651
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,733
And be reborn as the character

652
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:04,200
(#Yoll: Do you believe? If we say that all the stories in War Of Y are real)

653
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:09,920
(#Yoll: 1. Yes 2. No, I don't want to believe they're real)
