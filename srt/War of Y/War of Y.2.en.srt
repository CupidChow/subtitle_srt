1
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,542
Oh..

2
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,500
You still keep this one?

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,577
Today 10, tomorrow 100.

4
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,459
P'Candy, you're super high.

5
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:32,084
Ah, ah, ah.

6
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:37,583
What are you eating? You know how?
It might give you diarrhea.

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,600
If I got diarrhea,
I'll just go to the hospital.

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,600
Oh, Mod!

9
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:46,500
Yes.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,044
For today's scene,
don't touch branded items.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,933
So, how am I going to shoot?

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,288
That's your problem. I'm just warning you.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,800
Or you want to see the contract.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,977
Well, P'Candy,
you don't need to do that.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,422
This is nothing.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,866
It's something.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,488
What if Nott missed a presenter gig
because of this scene?

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,511
It's a stupid way to throw away money.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,777
I won't say it twice. Get it done.

20
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,251
Yes.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,155
(Pan sent you a text)

22
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,488
(Don’t forget what I told you.)

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,533
Sister?

24
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:34,490
Yes?

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,888
I would like to see all the outfits.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,644
That Nong Pan will wear.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,422
Yesterday they made him wear brick orange.

28
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,444
It's not good for him on camera.

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,888
Uh, but it's the same outfit from the fitting day.

30
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:53,422
I know, but it came out not pretty.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,244
You're going to let him

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,822
got killed by your costumes
while I just sit and watch?

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,422
I'd like to see all the outfits.

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,822
Thank you.

35
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,875
Yes.

36
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,334
Be careful.

37
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,667
Fuck.

38
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:42,499
Hello.

39
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,709
Hello.

40
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:44,959
Hello.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,667
Hello.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Have you eaten yet?

43
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:47,711
Want some?

44
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,917
OK.

45
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,499
Here.

46
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:56,084
Bew, Gus, if you're done,
pay your respects.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,666
Hi.

48
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,459
Come.

49
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,542
Pan?

50
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,917
Be careful of getting chocked.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,222
It will be irritating.

52
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,600
(War Of Y)
(Episode 2)

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,933
Do you know who came today?

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,355
How'd I know? Tell me.

55
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,251
Don't be a drag. I wanna know too.

56
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:03,376
You really want to know?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,792
Khun Tai, the producer from TTV.

58
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,822
He wants to make BL series.
He's here to take a look.

59
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
Huh!

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Perfect. I'll do my best
to clean my brush.

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,555
We must do our best
in case we get a job in a big channel.

62
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,022
Yea.

63
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:23,625
I'm with you.

64
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,750
Yes.

65
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,977
Khun Pan, I'll go wash my brush.

66
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:30,209
What are you waiting for?

67
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,459
Go. Go. Go.

68
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:43,170
(Tai, TTV Producer)

69
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,170
(Tai Pathai Chamnanchart)

70
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,170
(Nickname: Tai
Profession: Producer for TTV)

71
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,444
(Spouse: Wassana Chamnanchart
Previous works as follows...)

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,666
Listen carefully, it's a little detailed.

73
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,577
Let's put your hands here.

74
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,667
Oh, like this.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,866
Then you purse your lips in

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,555
and slowly walk in, walk in,

77
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,209
walk slowly, walk slowly,

78
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,244
Closer, closer, closer.

79
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:07,917
Close to a kiss.

80
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,459
And then slowly go down
down, down, and down,

81
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,542
Biting lips, ah.

82
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,577
Look at him, look at him.

83
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,580
Yeah, we have to feel...

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,334
Bird..

85
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,111
Oh, Tai!

86
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,466
Hey, everyone.

87
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,711
Khun Tai, the producer from TTV.

88
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,022
He will have a visit.

89
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,644
And, this is.

90
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:27,870
Khun Koon.

91
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,292
Miss Candy.

92
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,084
Nong Nott

93
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,777
and Nong Pan.

94
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,288
Why didn't I know you?
Everyone is so famous.

95
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,422
Not that much, but.

96
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,488
Y-Destiny series that P'Tai produced was really fun.

97
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,933
I watched every episode.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,977
Y-Destiny?

99
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,844
I didn't produce it.

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,777
Oh, it's written on Wikipedia, right?

101
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,577
My latest story is You Never Eat Alone.

102
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,266
I watched that too. So much fun.

103
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,418
Addictive.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,583
Bird?

105
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,466
And when are you done?

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,251
10 PM according to plan, unless...

107
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:11,009
It's around 10 o'clock.

108
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:15,418
But if you're gonna shoot more scenes,
it's gonna be a little late.

109
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,542
Huh?

110
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,688
This crew is so good.
No problem with cue.

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,822
Do you know if it's TTV,

112
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,355
it's very difficult to find a queue from big actors.

113
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,400
Well, let's take a picture.
And go in front of the monitor.

114
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,377
Good luck. Concentrate.

115
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,542
I will.

116
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,333
Ah, quickly.

117
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:43,418
Sit.

118
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,251
Ah, quickly.

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,555
Actors concentrate.

120
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,111
Actors ready?

121
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,292
Yes.

122
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Ready!

123
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,333
Okay, now we're ready to shoot.

124
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,911
3, 2, 1. Action!

125
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,251
Phone cue.

126
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,625
Cut!

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,533
Huh, why?

128
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,422
Nott, you can't hold the phone.

129
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,499
Oi.

130
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:16,376
Or.

131
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,333
Pan holds it instead?

132
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,088
Pan can't either.

133
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,444
Huh? Pan can't hold it either?

134
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,711
So, Mod, wait...

135
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,688
Oh, put the phone to your ear.

136
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,500
Okay.

137
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,167
Can you?

138
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,666
Too close.

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,711
Pan just take five for a while.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,244
- Thank you!
- And then, stunt grab the phone.

141
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,800
Come on, stunt.

142
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:45,660
Go on.

143
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
Urm, this is not okay either.

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,244
No again?

145
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,292
Umm.

146
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,622
Put your phone on a tripod and put it aside.

147
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,955
Let the actors talk like that. In the frame.

148
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,533
- Ok.
- Like this, ok.

149
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,844
Ready? Smoke machine! Make up!

150
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,583
Touch up! Be ready to take another shot.

151
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,466
Thank you.

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,834
Clean it.

153
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,167
Thank you.

154
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,955
Come out, Hurry up.

155
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,422
Concentrate.

156
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,911
Come on, ready?

157
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:40,800
3, 2, 1. Action.

158
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,959
Phone? Cue?

159
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Hello.

160
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,866
Everyone is safe?

161
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,311
Cut! Pass!

162
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,292
Hello!

163
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,511
Good.

164
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,792
Good take.

165
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,709
Thank you.

166
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,126
Here's the ice.

167
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,376
OK, thank you.

168
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,066
This shooting crew has ice cubes?

169
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,222
Oh, I actually bought it.

170
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,540
In case, people want to have some.

171
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,542
You're so kind.

172
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,376
Thank you.

173

What are you doing? It's too much.

189
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,933
What's too much.
We are a shipped couple.

190
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,044
Or you care about him?

191

Don't talk about other people.

192

If you really have a brain,
learn to think a little.

193
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,459
Or you gonna be an imaginary couple
for the rest of your life?

Hey, Pan.

198

Quit it,

It's been 5 years.

280
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,844
I went to pay pilgrimage in Ayutthaya
and met him there.

281
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,777
So I asked his parents permission.

282
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,955
Good for you to ask him to come.

283

Not deceiving him here.

284

Now there's lot of scammers.

285
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,200
Even my own channel often got impersonated.

286
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,733
When she talked to my parents,

287
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,150
they are secretly afraid.

288
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,444
But fortunately, P'Koon smooth talked it out.

289
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,822
So my parents trusted me to come
and live with Khun Koon.

290
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,400
Good.

291

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,066
What are you laughing at?

338
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,888
- Nothing. I just wanna help.
- Help him.

339
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,866
Come on, let's try one more time.

340
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,355
He must survive.

341
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,911
Tim, ran away.

342
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:27,508
(Next Break)
Let's go baby, this is not our place.

343
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,711
Is he usually like this?

344
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,220
Not really.

345
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,822
I think it's not good
for national TV drama.

346
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,534
Hey.

347
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:13,742
Huh?

348
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,367
You remember how many years
we've known each other?

349
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:22,826
Three years maybe.

350
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:31,492
So from now on,

351
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:35,325
no need to like my post
or any other service.

352
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:36,909
Stay away from me.

353
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,866
What the fuck is this?

354
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,951
Come on, do as I say.

355
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,034
Let me explain this scene a bit.

356
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,283
This scene won't be very difficult
but listen carefully.

357
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,867
It will be a love scene.

358
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,951
Trying to make things right.

359
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,992
So Nott will lie flat on the ground first.

360
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:03,076
Pan hunches down.

361
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,159
And then Nott come up to kiss.

362
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:07,200
To make up things
with your lover, ok?

363
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,159
OK.

364
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

365
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,118
Huh?

366
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,951
What boyfriend? He's still a virgin.

367
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,617
A virgin, oh?

368
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,511
Oh, ok. Virgin it is.

369
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:25,220
If so, this scene.
Pan, remember that

370
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:28,242
you two are dating,

371
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,325
so you have quite some time together.

372
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:34,992
I want lot of action, like a lot.

373
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,367
Wait, wait, wait.

374
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:41,909
Can we don't do too much?
I think this is too much.

375
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,617
He never have a boyfriend.
He couldn't do it.

376
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,409
But this is season 2,
how about some character development?

377
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,488
Or give people the same boring kiss?

378
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,742
Who will remember?

379
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,325
It has to be this.

380
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:56,617
Can you do it, Pan?

381
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,866
- Yes? I believe this is good.
- Yes.

382
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:02,450
Nott?

383
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:03,659
I'm fine, bro.

384
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,333
I'll kiss so hard that no one forgets.

385
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,200
Can you do it?

386
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:17,575
OK, we'd better prepare.

387
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,409
Focus, we're ready to shoot.

388
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,034
I'll wait and see this scene.

389
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:25,742
OK.

390
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,530
Let's shoot.

391
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:12,492
Do it for me.

392
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,377
(BL shows are just
a bunch of fan service scenes.)

393
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,370
(Why do they make this kind of show?)

394
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,911
(All they care about is money.
They're willing to be irresponsible.)

395
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,355
(- It feels awkward to watch.
- This is irresponsible.)

396
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,466
(- The bar is in hell.
- You know this is queer bating?)

397
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,600
(The industry keeps
getting worse every day.)

398
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,666
(- It does not good to the community?
- Uncomfortable to watch. #BanTheShow)

399
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,533
(Do their fans actually like this?)

400
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,909
Hey! Pan!

401
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,800
Pan!

402
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,125
Pan, Pan, are you ok?

403
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,242
Oh my gosh.

404
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,534
What's wrong, Pan?

405
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:05,575
What's wrong?

406
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,444
I'm okay.

407
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,955
I'll take him to rest a bit.

408
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,511
He can't take it anymore.
Let's go take a rest.

409
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,111
Take a break.

410
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,242
Nott, Nott, what's wrong?

411
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:21,784
I'm fine.

412
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:22,951
You sure?

413
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,577
Yes.

414
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:25,909
Take care of yourself.

415
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,822
Oh, I feel dizzy. What is this?

416
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,000
Just postpone this scene.

417
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,159
Yes.

418
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,812
- Shoot it another day, change the set.
- Change the scene.

419
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,422
Change again, another change.

420
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,742
Nong Pan,

421
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:46,951
are you okay?

422
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:48,826
Want to go back home?

423
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,511
I'm fine.

424
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,450
Are you sure?

425
00:30:57,742 --> 00:30:59,826
I'll go talk to the director for you.

426
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,088
Rest a bit and then back to shoot, OK?

427
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,422
Rest a bit.

428
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,200
How are you doing?

429
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,577
Gotten better?

430
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,288
I have an inhaler. Do you want it?

431
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,325
Bew,

432
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:41,659
let's go.

433
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,577
This is not our place.

434
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,575
Do you want it, P'Pan?

435
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,933
No, Bew.

436
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,288
Go.

437
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,933
Bird?

438
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,700
Is he usually like this?

439
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Usually,

440
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:16,534
not like this.

441
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:17,992
He.

442
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,118
Always puts everything in.

443
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,240
So he doesn’t like love scenes?

444
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:31,283
Umm.

445
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,700
At first I was eyeing in this one.

446
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,488
But if he's gonna be like this,

447
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,159
I think he's not suitable for TV drama.

448
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:49,784
Let's go.

449
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,155
Get inside.

450
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:51,534
At first I was eyeing this one.

451
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,466
But if he's gonna be like this,

452
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,034
I think he's not suitable for TV drama.

453
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:24,111
(Don’t forget about the IG photo ad.)

454
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,022
(It’s late but I can enjoy it
because it’s Bonus.)

455
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,600
(There are barely any calories.)

456
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,644
(#Bonus, Delicious and Slim
Tag me in your post if you’ve tried it.)

457
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,377
(It’s the second post from him
Nott doesn’t like.)

458
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:45,867
News in: a shipped couple falls apart
due to love scene on set.

459
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,177
(Next Break) (It’s the second post from him Nott doesn’t like.)
Nott hasn't liked 2 posts of Pan.

460
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,617
People will think it's them.

461
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:55,034
For real, why do you want likes or
to service the fan that bad?

462
00:36:55,283 --> 00:36:57,492
Everything that I did, it's all me.

463
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,283
What fucking service are you talking about?

464
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:07,600
(War of Y)

465
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:14,955
(War of Y)

466
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:19,634
Nong Pan, your skin is dry

467
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:22,009
and your eyes are swallen.

468
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:23,799
You've been filming a lot, right?

469
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,967
I'll curl your lashes
to make the eyes look less swollen.

470
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:30,300
Oh, but still handsome.

471
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:31,634
Very handsome.

472
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:38,342
You're very handsome, can I take a picture?

473
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,009
Yes, you can.

474
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,509
Can I? No problem, right?

475
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,777
I think it's better for me to pay, P' Hua.

476
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,577
I don't want to take advantage of you.

477
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:52,092
Right, P'Koon?

478
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:54,925
P'Hua came to us for free.

479
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:58,799
And he is a well known artist, so no problem.

480
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,676
P' Hua, shoot away.

481
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:01,842
OK?

482
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:03,009
No problem.

483
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:04,009
No problem.

484
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,092
No.

485
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:07,259
Do handsome shot.

486
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,066
Turn a little.

487
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,842
Good, good. This corner is good.

488
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:13,175
Oh, handsome.

489
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,259
Now turn this side.

490
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,384
So handsome. On camera, so handsome.

491
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,300
This angle he looks so great, right?

492
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,134
- Okay, okay, I got my handsome shot now.
- Thank you P'Hua. Thank you.

493
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:25,710
Can you wear it?

494
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:27,384
It's a little tight here, P'Koon,

495
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:28,842
but wearable.

496
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,842
Why is he wearing that?

497
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:36,342
That was worn by you?

498
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:39,718
I remember that but why is he wearing that?

499
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:42,634
Why can't I?

500
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,533
Or do you want to wear it again?

501
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,842
I don't like sharing things with anyone.
Especially with you.

502
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,822
Pan!

503
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:55,509
Nong Pan!

504
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:59,050
- Pharaoh will take a review for it.
- Take it off.

505
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:02,718
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I don't get it.

506
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,111
Whatever we did,
the journalists will only be interested in you.

507
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,311
You don't understand is right.
Because you are not in the same spot as me.

508
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,422
It's okay, let's go change.

509
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:18,467
P'Koon.

510
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:19,799
Come on, let's go.

511
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,333
Okay now? Just stay here.

512
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:23,467
- P'Hua, let's go.
- OK.

513
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:24,634
See you babes.

514
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:25,718
Hello.

515
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,634
Pan, wait here. I will be back.

516
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,092
OK.

517
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,092
Oh, hello.

518
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:04,799
- Hello.
- Hello.

519
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:13,920
Wait here.
I'll take care of the parking ticket.

520
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,800
- OK.
- OK.

521
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,090
Have you stop being crazy?

522
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
Who is crazy?

523
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,311
It's you, who is crazy.

524
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:55,175
Why do you want likes, want to
service the fans that bad?

525
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:57,842
Aren't you tired at all?

526
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,842
What service? What are you talking about?

527
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:06,066
I liked your picture because I wanted to.

528
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,551
I take care of you, I compliment you.

529
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,217
Everything that I do is all me.

530
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,342
And you're saying I'm servicing the fans?

531
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:18,210
You're the one who know best

532
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,092
the reason why I did what I did?

533
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:28,175
Or is it you who did it to service?

534
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,676
Nott and Pan, over here.

535
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,200
OK.

536
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,222
OK.

537
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,200
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

538
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:48,842
Please.

539
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:07,134
- Shall we?
- Yes, please.

540
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,460
Please.

541
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,459
Let's go find something delicious to eat.

542
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,244
- OK.
- Please.

543
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,644
Wait a minute.

544
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:34,488
What's your name?

545
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
My name is Life.

546
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,342
Life?

547
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:45,311
Hey.

548
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:48,009
The Don't wanna Gossip Page posted a stupid post.

549
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,217
Gossips!

550
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:53,800
There's a shipped couple falled apart

551
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:55,634
because of the love scene on set.

552
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:59,175
Hint: they are a couple
currently filming a series together.

553
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:02,842
Usually they are sweet
but now haven't liked 2 IG posts.

554
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,095
If you know who they are, don't need to tell me.

555
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:06,467
I don't want to get sued.

556
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,883
Who are they, P'Koon?

557
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,355
Can I not go in?

558
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:14,759
I have a headache.

559
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:17,311
Wanna puke.

560
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:20,217
Do you want medicine?

561
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:24,718
Hey.

562
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,134
We have to go.

563
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:27,634
If we don't go in,

564
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,200
people will think that we were not invited.

565
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:35,880
Even if you have to carry a breathing aids,
you have to go.

566
00:43:36,384 --> 00:43:37,384
Please.

567
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:41,750
Go faint in the event

568
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:43,777
so people can see.

569
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:44,799
Hey.

570
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,250
- Let's go.
- P'Pan, Hello.

571
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:49,634
Hi.

572
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,866
Hi.

573
00:43:51,488 --> 00:43:54,710
See, I told you he had to be invited.

574
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,259
Well, I didn't see him in the dressing room.

575
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,200
Or is he VIP?

576
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:09,925
Please come in.

577
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:10,800
OK.

578
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:11,384
Yes.

579
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:12,842
This way.

580
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,592
(It’s here!) (You made me wait.) (Can you be more punctual?) (#Pan, Nott’s baby) (Will we get to see their interaction?) (How many couples are there?) (Who are the other boys?)
Hello.

581
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:49,300
(Please show me more of Nott and Pan)
(#Nott Pan)
(I’m tired of his fans.)
Oh, wow, love the energy.
Welcome everyone to.

582
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:54,009
(Don’t do this again. Some fans of a certain actor don’t know how to behave.)
the Exclusive Live Event with Mangmoom.

583
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,044
(- Type 1 if you’re here for Gus and Bew.
- So many reporters.)

584
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,977
(As if we want our baby to work
with your no-name fave.)

585
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,977
(I don’t know anyone
except Nott and Pan.)

586
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,400
(- Is that one of Koon’s boys?
- Who’s the cutie with chubby cheeks?)

587
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,466
(Nott looks like a businessman.)

588
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,577
(Are you sure this is an event
and not their wedding? #Nott and Pan)

589
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,200
(- Is it them? The Rotten Couple?
- Pan is cute today.)

590
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,533
(- Matching suits? So cute.
- Pharaoh looks good, too.)

591
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,266
(Did they make up? It’s been a while
since they liked each other’s post.)

592
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,466
(- Gus and Bew look good together.
- Gus is cute.)

593
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,022
(That couple tries so hard.
Our faves don't have to.)

594
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:13,020
(- Nott and Pan made up?
- Oh my god. Cute.)

595
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,511
(There should be more men like Nott.)

596
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,466
(Is this event to show they’re
still friends?)

597
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,377
(They wouldn’t be this cute
if they’re fighting.)

598
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,333
(Thank you haters for being so
interested in our faves.)

599
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,777
(You should trend your fave’s hashtag.
- I love this couple the best.)

600
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,134
So.

601
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,488
Pan, Nott, stepped up a bit.

602
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,066
Oh yes, yes, please.

603
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,866
Err.

604
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:29,799
Pharaoh, take a step back.

605
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:31,750
No, no, Pharaoh,

606
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,000
move up like before, it's good.

607
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:37,072
Go back a little more, don't overlap.

608
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,711
Like before is good.

609
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:42,092
Please don't overlap shoulders,
step back.

610
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:45,799
Okay, okay now? Mamas, can we?

611
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:48,676
Okay, take photo, beautiful.

612
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,333
See? Mamas arraged them.

613
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:52,967
You will get nice picture for sure.

614
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:56,259
Mafia Baby Season 2, how is it going?

615
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,333
Well, we are at 30 percent done.

616
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,175
We have shooting every day now.

617
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,800
And in this season, I heard that there will be
a very intense love scene.

618
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:07,842
Is this true?

619
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,688
Hey, where did you get it from?

620
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:12,762
I think you'd better wait and see in the series.

621
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:17,509
And is it true that behind the scene,
you two fought a lot that

622
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,467
the shooting team had to stop.

623
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Is it true?

624
00:46:29,592 --> 00:46:30,342
That's funny.

625
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:31,676
Where did you get it?

626
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Well,

627
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:35,799
we saw that Nott hasn't liked
2 posts of Pan's already.

628
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,259
So people think you're fighting.

629
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,551
Oh.

630
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,467
Is that it?

631
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,622
Come on, let me stop the news.

632
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,300
Here.

633
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:53,634
Hmm.

634
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:54,901
And if you're still not satisfied,

635
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,955
I'll unlike old photos and
like all new photos, all right?

636
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,050
OK?

637
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:01,175
It's not just Pan's.

638
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:03,689
I didn't like a single one of my friends'.

639
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:07,050
I wonder if I have news fighting
with other friends too?

640
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:22,217
Hey!

641
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,217
- Nong Pan.
- Pan.

642
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,092
Nott.

643
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,300
Stop taking pictures.

644
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:27,467
Help.

645
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:29,259
Pan.

646
00:47:45,634 --> 00:47:46,634
You woke up?

647
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:57,194
You woke up or you pretended the faint?

648
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:00,467
How about the event?

649
00:48:07,444 --> 00:48:08,577
Give it back.

650
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:10,670
Answer me

651
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:12,812
that you really fainted or just pretending.

652
00:48:20,842 --> 00:48:22,759
I cared about people on the internet so much.

653
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:25,488
So do you even care about yourself?

654
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:28,092
Your body, your mind.

655
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:31,217
How can you leave it like this?

656
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:36,134
Hey, Pan.

657
00:48:39,092 --> 00:48:40,883
You are the only one in this world

658
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:44,342
that built a wall around yourself.

659
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,592
For real, are you really happy?

660
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:51,134
Pan.

661
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,485
We've known each other for a long time.

662
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,799
I know you don't trust anyone.

663
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,333
But can you trust me?

664
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,177
Why do you act like you're alone in this world,

665
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,577
even though I'm right here.

666
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,288
Can you let me into your world?

667
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:37,050
Well, I'm just tired.

668
00:49:40,955 --> 00:49:43,288
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.

669
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:45,000
Why?

670
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:47,718
When we service, we get insulted.

671
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,977
When we don't serve, we get insulted.

672
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:54,634
And what kind of a shipped couple
do they want me to be?

673
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:58,925
Why all I did seems so wrong?

674
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,466
Or just being me,
is the reason that they hate.

675
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,866
Enough, Pan, enough.

676
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,134
That's enough.

677
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:28,888
The world is just as bad as it is.

678
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,555
But do you know

679
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,511
that I won't treat you badly.

680
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,133
(Pan Passed Out)

681
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,088
(According to his manager, he’d been working
a lot and didn’t get enough sleep)

682
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:03,844
(He was working for a new show
while attending events. Take care, Pan.

683
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:04,967
(Who?, Ignore him if you don’t like him.
There’s no need for harsh words.)

684
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:07,050
(Next Week)
Many people are seeing Nott and Pun

685
00:51:07,092 --> 00:51:08,592
as the next Dew-P.

686
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:10,300
If we were the next,

687
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,600
so the original must be outdated.

688
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,955
There are no people in this house?

689
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,355
Your dad's blood pressure has gone up.
It's been 2 days. Your mom is at the hospital.

690
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:20,844
Can I stay with you tonight?

691
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,022
Are you sure?
