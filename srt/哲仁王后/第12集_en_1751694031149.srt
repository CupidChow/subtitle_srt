1
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,510
(This drama is purely fictional. The characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,040
It's you

3
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,580
You are that guy.

4
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,920
I absolutely can't forgive

5
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,900
I must take your life

6
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,850
(Episode 12: Sword Dance)

7
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,800
(Episode 12)

8
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,440
Do you understand now?

9
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,060
Who is the owner of this palace?

10
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,300
I thought you were my prey and almost shot you.

11
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Aren't you regretting that you didn't hit the target?

12
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,630
You misunderstood

13
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,100
You better remember where you are now

14
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm going to change my clothes.

15
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,740
It's your highness

16
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,850
I need you to do something in Yijinfu

17
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,570
Do you have to be so cruel to Hongyue?

18
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,090
What's wrong with me

19
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,510
Do you have to kill her?

20
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,580
After killing her, why do we have to throw her into the well miserably?

21
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,440
To threaten me

22
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,600
Are you going to do this to an innocent child?

23
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,990
I killed her

24
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,130
How could you have such a big misunderstanding?

25
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,520
If it weren't for cooking

26
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,540
I won't endanger any life.

27
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,010
The body found in the well was just a coincidence

28
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,630
Or someone is alienating us.

29
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,870
Keep denying it.

30
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,200
I'll only get angrier

31
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,560
It's really driving me crazy

32
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,300
It's really not me

33
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,590
Why do you always think so bad of me?

34
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,350
Because you've always been like this

35
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,970
What I Know About Kim So-yong

36
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,210
Fully capable of doing this

37
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,620
I don't even know myself, do you know me so well?

38
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,350
Who liars most often deceive

39
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,650
It's yourself

40
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,450
You always deceive yourself

41
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,800
Can you understand yourself?

42
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,810
You and I have now truly crossed the river of no return

43
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,470
I won't care anymore no matter what misunderstandings you have about me

44
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,690
It's up to you.

45
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,220
Who shot it?

46
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,730
We have been chasing for so long, who dares to...

47
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,210
The winner is decided

48
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,640
Let's go back

49
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,360
It's the queen

50
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,850
Blood

51
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,850
I go

52
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,850
Are you crazy?

53
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,930
It hurts so much

54
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,900
Forgive my fear

55
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,480
My hand slipped

56
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,010
I go

57
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,320
Are you okay, sis?

58
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,680
It's painful even if it's cotton.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,210
Yipin, what are you doing...

60
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,570
Let me give an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

61
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,770
You are dead

62
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,910
Huh

63
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,910
I will bear with it today for the sake of the three concubines.

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,940
After all, he is in a high position

65
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,080
That's right

66
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm going to Heejeongjeon

67
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,470
But

68
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,460
I have to accompany you to change clothes...

69
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,410
Things are not good recently

70
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,090
I can act alone.

71
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,540
Those who are gathered here today

72
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,100
You should think that the Lord is a powerful person.

73
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,260
Always following the Lord

74
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,710
The title of Jiang Hua Shao Ye

75
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,460
Will become just gossip

76
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,010
The reason why the Lord insisted on holding a banquet

77
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,010
In order to change his position in the court

78
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,840
When he was preparing these things

79
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,110
Brother, what on earth did you do?

80
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,780
I am afraid

81
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,250
only

82
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,060
I have also prepared a gift for my lord.

83
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,420
Please wait and see.

84
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,520
Then your gift better not disappoint me

85
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,080
One point for Concubine Hong

86
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,600
Two points for Concubine Yi

87
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,620
Concubine Min Shu

88
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,050
Concubine Yin Shu also scored four points

89
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,090
Empress of the Middle Temple

90
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,210
very

91
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,400
So the winner

92
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,360
The Queen Mother

93
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,470
Please ask the Queen Mother to present the award

94
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,790
Just enjoy the process.

95
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,000
Did you practice secretly?

96
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,730
It's just that I'm better at performing on the spot.

97
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,200
So the actual combat is stronger

98
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,830
Congratulations, Madam

99
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,710
Congratulations, Madam

100
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,380
Cunning Woman

101
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,050
Now we are going to the main hall to attend the banquet.

102
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,560
There's still some time before the banquet starts.

103
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,730
Take a break before going again

104
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,170
Hunting must be tiring.

105
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,590
It's the Queen Consort

106
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,820
It hurts, right?

107
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,180
This one?

108
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,860
I finally understand why Eunuch Jin was so scared.

109
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,150
Niangniang

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,360
Go to the Dazaodian and change your clothes.

111
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,260
Just go back and take a rest

112
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,260
yes

113
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,640
It still hurts a bit now.

114
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,390
The banquet is about to begin

115
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,000
Why did Yipin do that?

116
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,780
Someone must be trying to drive a wedge between us.

117
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,300
Who is it?

118
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,020
Those who know the evil fate of the well

119
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,370
There are three types of history since ancient times

120
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,810
The most vicious rumor in the palace

121
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,020
The secret fight between women

122
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,030
Power struggles in the imperial court

123
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,250
Finally,

124
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,140
Poison

125
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,930
Is that why Choi Sang-Gong keeps mentioning poison?

126
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,020
I have lived in the palace for decades.

127
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,410
I've seen all kinds of poisons.

128
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,160
Taking away lives

129
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
A drop of deadly poison

130
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,410
Slowly let the poison disguise as a hidden poison that causes death

131
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,860
There are many cases where the cause of death has not been determined.

132
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,350
But he was definitely poisoned to death.

133
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,820
Yes, the palace is too dangerous.

134
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,040
Now it seems that the person who just looked like Han Shizhang

135
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,730
Yes, that guy.

136
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,220
Didn't see

137
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
I ran away immediately

138
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,760
Are you sure?

139
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,590
yes

140
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,310
Let me catch you.

141
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,720
Choi Sang-Gong

142
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,050
Who was that guy who just whispered to him?

143
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,950
Go and ask around.

144
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,080
I guess that guy's last name is Han

145
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,720
I can bet two dragon balls that I don't have

146
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,000
The party is about to begin

147
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,030
Won't start

148
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,050
As long as that guy is still rampant

149
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,230
What

150
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,280
Then wait for the experienced

151
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,980
Damn

152
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,210
How did this development relate to my experience at the time?

153
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,580
Exactly the same

154
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,390
That guy Cheoljong knows nothing.

155
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,520
It turns out that people still have to live their own lives so that they wonâ€™t regret it.

156
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm going to be myself and ignore it

157
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,910
But that guy clearly added something to the water just now.

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,960
Could it be poison?

159
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,250
Really not.

160
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,030
No matter how dangerous the palace is

161
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,830
It couldn't be a group poisoning.

162
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,380
No

163
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,630
You see, anxiety and fear are contagious.

164
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,490
I go

165
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,830
where are you going

166
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,680
I go to crime scenes to secure evidence

167
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,130
That's the Dazao Temple.

168
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,270
My heart was swaying back and forth, causing my feet to go astray

169
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,810
Let's go together, my lady.

170
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,650
Why does it smell a bit like grass?

171
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,370
What did he add?

172
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,120
No, my lady.

173
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,710
Right?

174
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,290
How to do this

175
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,770
Your Highness

176
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,990
I've tried my best to prepare

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,290
But the party is about to begin

178
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,630
The materials have not arrived yet

179
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,260
The materials will come even if it is a little late.

180
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,850
Trust me, don't give up.

181
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,960
Then I'll think of a way.

182
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,510
Just give up

183
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,240
You'll be much freer if you give up, you fool

184
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,520
nave

185
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,560
You know this won't work.

186
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
Instead of struggling like this

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
It will only make you and the people around you suffer.

188
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
You mean

189
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,720
Do you want to be bullied like a corpse all the time?

190
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,420
I can't do this

191
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,800
I will try my best

192
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,970
If I am causing pain to the nave

193
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,050
Then forget it.

194
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,380
That's right

195
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,250
We have a no touch relationship

196
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Ok I understand

197
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,240
Niangniang

198
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,570
Why do you say such insincere words?

199
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,430
What is insincere?

200
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,700
Even if I say nonsense, I say it from the heart.

201
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,710
I never say anything that I don't mean.

202
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,840
You are worried

203
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,450
Seeing His Highness trying so hard, I'm afraid he'll get hurt.

204
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,470
Oh, what do you know?

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,800
The most useless thing in the world is to worry about celebrities

206
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,940
And Wang

207
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,540
Every time you want to hide your true feelings

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,540
I'll say something weird like this

209
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,550
The water is poisonous.

210
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,980
Hello

211
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,230
Waiting for an experienced person

212
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,220
Just here.

213
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,040
not good

214
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,110
Did you escape?

215
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,270
Always pretending to be so professional

216
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,560
Just live for yourself

217
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,340
So what should we do at today's banquet?

218
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,140
Your Highness works so hard.

219
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,520
Without ingredients, the chef ran away again

220
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,920
Already finished playing

221
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,920
You mean

222
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,920
Do you want to be bullied like a corpse all the time?

223
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,650
I can't do this

224
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,010
I will try my best

225
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,650
Oh, really.

226
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,430
Hong Yan, thank you for your hard work

227
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,950
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

228
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,120
Hard

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,980
What's the name of the person who just left?

230
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,570
Why do you ask this?

231
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,820
Because I have to ask

232
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,340
I can't just tell you

233
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,450
oops

234
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,600
Leaving a scoundrel-like lady

235
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,330
Alone in the palace

236
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,110
I don't know what trouble will happen.

237
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,830
Oh, long time no see.

238
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,710
Because I have a cold

239
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,110
Borrow it, thanks.

240
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,280
Mimi is rice

241
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:15,910
Come soon

242
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,360
Hey, my old customers.

243
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,140
A lot of good stuff just came in.

244
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,930
Now is not the time

245
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,900
You got the wrong person.

246
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
oops

247
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,100
yes

248
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,070
Damn

249
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,240
Damn

250
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,820
Why are there so many temptations today?

251
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,640
But I, Choi Sang-Gong, will never waver.

252
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,080
Shang Gong

253
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,810
What can I do for you?

254
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,910
He actually hid such great strength.

255
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,400
Always pretending to be unknown

256
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,970
Your body must feel very uncomfortable.

257
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,490
How did you endure it?

258
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,300
I'm used to it so it doesn't feel strange.

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,230
I see

260
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
Is this all I can give you?

261
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,340
The man in the magic mirror

262
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,060
Is it really not you?

263
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,640
Really, I said it wasn't me

264
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,900
to be honest

265
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,190
Although this person who carved with a knife

266
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,700
Really like me

267
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,090
But unfortunately, this is not me

268
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,500
It's great to be able to sign the name of someone who looks so similar

269
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,940
I feel honored

270
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,470
Where is it

271
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,480
I said

272
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,360
This man is among the maids

273
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,820
Is it that popular?

274
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,110
It's more like a craze than a popularity.

275
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,900
I didn't know I was so popular

276
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,700
oops

277
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,490
What is the name of such a distinguished person?

278
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,700
Last name: Han

279
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,750
The name is Shen Yan

280
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,230
So you are

281
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,190
Han Shimeng

282
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,410
Don't forget

283
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,480
When the atmosphere of the banquet reached its climax

284
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,540
When the Lord rises

285
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,260
At that time

286
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,330
When you take out the account book

287
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,580
Hey little girl

288
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,140
I have something to trouble you.

289
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,480
Can you give this to that person?

290
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,730
Who is it?

291
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,170
That's her

292
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,580
Oh, okay.

293
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,660
grown ups

294
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,980
The young master asked me to give this to you.

295
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,210
I have something to say in the name of my family.

296
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,140
I'll wait for you at the pavilion.

297
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
No

298
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,420
Did you find anything?

299
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,360
You are here

300
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,120
I have something to tell you

301
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,600
So I took the liberty of asking you to come here

302
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,700
For me, family

303
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,400
As important as my life

304
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,090
but

305
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,690
After countless troubled nights

306
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,530
I have decided

307
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,160
Choose something more important than family

308
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,960
If my family disagrees

309
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,520
I'm giving up my family

310
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,630
From now on I

311
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,740
I just want to be your flower boy

312
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,610
You now

313
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,050
Are you kidding me, Busy Man?

314
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,430
You are...

315
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,060
There was such a transportation accident.

316
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,590
What did I do again?

317
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,070
Oh my stomach

318
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,050
Stick out your tongue

319
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Stretch out a little more

320
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,930
My belly

321
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,700
It seems that he ate poisonous herbs.

322
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,410
Probably

323
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,720
Grind the marijuana leaves into powder and pour it in

324
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,760
I said everyone

325
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,170
no

326
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,050
Will the imperial physician come in person?

327
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,210
The Queen Mother asked me to come.

328
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,210
My aunt asked me to look at the drinking water.

329
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,240
I found out someone put some poisonous weeds in there.

330
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,290
This drinking water...

331
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,220
It's a drinking water problem.

332
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,750
How can it be so normal to wait for an experienced person?

333
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,920
As I look like a very sensitive type

334
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,060
If you are nervous, you can't even drink a sip of water.

335
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,500
Obviously looks like

336
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,320
Can fall asleep even when there is gunfire all over the sky

337
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,090
How can a royal doctor be so incapable of judging people?

338
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,690
I am an imperial physician, not a fortune teller.

339
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,930
But

340
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,250
I am a famous doctor.

341
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,480
It's hard to recover today.

342
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,720
Even if the ingredients come

343
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,320
These experienced people look like this

344
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,760
Which guy is it?

345
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,540
Guy I haven't seen before

346
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,560
Did you poison him?

347
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,830
I'm here for this party.

348
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,730
A specially invited expert sent by the master

349
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,360
His name is Li Shengli

350
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,580
Come save this hellish kitchen

351
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,650
for you

352
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,440
Anyone who sees it knows it's the queen

353
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,930
Isn't it?

354
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,570
How can you tell it's the empress? Looking at that man

355
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,460
I really don't have the eyes to look at people.

356
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,200
Now I am watching the dancing lady carefully. Why is she looking for her here?

357
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,620
The official lady

358
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,650
In the amusement park.

359
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,710
Isn't it?

360
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,880
tomato

361
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

362
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,860
This is a persimmon. You are a persimmon because it only grows for one year.

363
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,670
Where did the country people come from?

364
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,700
A person who is called an experienced person may not even know the age of a persimmon.

365
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,160
hateful

366
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,790
How dare you call a guy

367
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,930
Is it not okay for experienced people to call each other guys?

368
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,050
Isn't it?

369
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,310
Yeah, you guy.

370
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,350
That's not right.

371
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,260
What kind of skilled worker is this guy who left the kitchen and ran away?

372
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,260
What are you saying?

373
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,850
I don't have a stomachache

374
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,040
I thought that no matter what kind of ingredients I had, I would go to the inner farm.

375
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,560
Inner farm?

376
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,630
The King's Vegetable Garden

377
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,030
I don't know anything

378
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,000
See what's there

379
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,310
The beginning of cooking

380
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,770
Start by finding good ingredients

381
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,530
Next to the King's Garden

382
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,500
Is there no king's chicken coop?

383
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,370
If you have eggs, you can cook anything.

384
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm starting to growl with hunger so soon

385
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,350
It seems to be for the banquet food

386
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,470
I've been hungry since yesterday.

387
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,260
I know I'm hungry

388
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,540
This means that the Minister of Personnel is also like this.

389
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,370
In a little while

390
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,660
The banquet that the master is so persistent about is about to begin

391
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,240
Looking forward to it

392
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,880
The banquets at Cheong Wa Dae always have a theme.

393
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,100
Because it's not just a dinner party, it's a political occasion

394
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,820
What is better?

395
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,170
What is the purpose of today's banquet?

396
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,890
What's this

397
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,970
There are also food recipes made by His Highness himself.

398
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,050
List of people attending the banquet today

399
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,070
This is the food recipe I have only heard of.

400
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,240
Will match the ingredients

401
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,490
Making new food recipes

402
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
how's it going

403
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm too embarrassed to see you.

404
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
Encountered a thief

405
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,860
Food is not the goal

406
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,120
It's finally started

407
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,490
Didn't you say we're going to have a banquet?

408
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,560
Just presenting a few?

409
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,620
Is this a dining table bed?

410
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,450
(The food served to the king at a national banquet)
Is this a dining table bed?

411
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:41,640
(The food served to the king at a national banquet)

412
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,250
Could it be
(The food served to the king at a national banquet)

413
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,470
(The food served to the king at a national banquet)

414
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,280
Is this all?
(The food served to the king at a national banquet)

415
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,520
Is this all?

416
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,200
There must be others.

417
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,210
Your Highness

418
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,660
What's going on

419
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,510
Every year, the people cannot get enough food.

420
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,080
Most died of hunger.

421
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,700
In order not to forget such hardships

422
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,410
today

423
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,090
Prepared a simple

424
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,570
The meals people eat

425
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,020
Although the idea is good

426
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,780
But this is not the level of simplicity

427
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,770
Even if it is right to teach the ministers

428
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,110
For those who have come from afar

429
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,280
The adults of the three families

430
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,060
It's a bit unreasonable to give such a hospitality

431
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,260
That's right

432
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,290
You have to treat guests like this.

433
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,310
It's a punishment.

434
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,500
Although food is insufficient

435
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,110
My thoughts are profound

436
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,610
I hope you understand

437
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,140
(30 minutes ago)

438
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,510
Like this through

439
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,270
What is this graffiti?

440
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,750
Give me the potatoes

441
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,800
Let me show you

442
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,450
The big needle has only now found its original position

443
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,750
What

444
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,210
Now

445
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,070
Light the fire and pour the oil

446
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,410
Oil

447
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,830
Dare

448
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,680
My precious needle exploded.

449
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,070
I'll clean it for you.

450
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,830
What a big needle that is!

451
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,190
This is a 50-year-old acupuncture technique passed down to me by my master.

452
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,230
Come come come

453
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,220
If it's 50 years, then all that should be used has been used up.

454
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,860
No, I can't use it again.

455
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,150
I will pass it on to my apprentice.

456
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,950
Don't push me

457
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,380
alright

458
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,800
It looks good with a piercing in the middle

459
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,930
In the middle of the potato

460
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,340
Evenly fried in a short time

461
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,720
How did you come up with this novel cooking method?

462
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,040
Street food is a battle against time

463
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,390
An emergency like today is just right.

464
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,040
Street?

465
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,510
There is this thing

466
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,960
It can be said to be a battlefield of taste

467
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,980
It's food for surviving in very intense places.

468
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,130
Come

469
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,520
for you

470
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,550
Skin it

471
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,490
Me?

472
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
So who's coming?

473
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,030
It says it needs a mat

474
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,280
I'm here to see how the banquet is being prepared.

475
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,500
Cut it cleanly

476
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,120
Cut as thinly as possible

477
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,960
The end should be pointed

478
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,580
Because it is convenient to string the potatoes in.

479
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,680
Take some out. The fire is too big.

480
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,450
yes

481
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,200
The fire here is a little stronger.

482
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:34,960
yes

483
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,950
Come Come

484
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,610
Everyone pays attention

485
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,990
Today we made

486
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,560
More than just food

487
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,870
It's the president's face.

488
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,480
What I mean is

489
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,560
This is the Lord's face.

490
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,770
Is this level okay?

491
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,620
Niangniang

492
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,980
Not a chef

493
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,370
Let me see

494
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,530
well done

495
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,820
They need to understand my purpose.

496
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,240
This is

497
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,990
Plain

498
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,590
Food for the people?

499
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,000
Your Majesty, don't you know what the people are eating these days?

500
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,930
(Dragon Beard Potato)

501
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,970
No matter how well-intentioned

502
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,170
Welcoming such precious guests

503
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,190
You can't treat it with negligence.

504
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,360
so

505
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,100
Although the material is simple

506
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,450
But the meal was prepared in a very fresh style

507
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,480
The first course of the banquet

508
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,050
Made from potatoes

509
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,620
This is

510
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,580
Potatoes?

511
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,230
Not your average potato

512
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,900
This name is

513
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,780
Spray dragon beard

514
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,260
Dragon Beard Potato

515
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,770
Because it looks like a dragon's beard

516
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,460
So it is called dragon beard potato

517
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,100
Eaten on special days

518
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,960
Special food

519
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,570
It's just potatoes.

520
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,530
What dragon are you talking about?

521
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,350
Too exaggerated

522
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,450
If there is no potato

523
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,660
More people lose their lives every year

524
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,840
Rough-grown potatoes

525
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,760
It can grow well even in bad soil.

526
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,560
Easy to store

527
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,380
Thatâ€™s why it became the staple food of hungry people.

528
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,470
This fresh product saves people's lives

529
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,300
You can't say it's just potatoes.

530
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,880
Try it.

531
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,420
This is so delicious

532
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,580
This is the first time I've experienced this taste.

533
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,500
It seems our council is very hungry.

534
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,980
Is this a potato?

535
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,370
The three seasonings served together

536
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
Green powder is used

537
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,070
The Nanyang Hong family is located here

538
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,500
Venus leaf of Hwaseong Palace

539
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
Made with Chili Salt

540
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,260
Kosher salt

541
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,690
The red powder is

542
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,170
Using Barley Flower Sugar

543
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,590
What are you talking about barley flower candy?

544
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,570
If the barley flower is so luxurious

545
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,660
There's no need to worry about any danger.

546
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,820
It is the food that people usually eat.

547
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,280
Staple food ground into powder

548
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,550
Mixed with wild grapes grown at the gate of the Yin family in Popyeong

549
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,010
Producing beautiful colors and aromas

550
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,190
The yellow liquid is peach juice

551
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,720
This is where the Yongxing Min family is located.

552
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,270
Made from the finest peaches

553
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,200
The theme of today's banquet is

554
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,070
and

555
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,980
Although politics divides people

556
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,450
But good food brings people together

557
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,170
Let this place shine

558
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,280
The fusion of the three excellent families

559
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,810
I hope you all enjoy this delicious

560
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,190
Sweet Potato Zucchini Eggplant

561
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,780
After all the cutting and frying

562
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,980
Boil with broth and eggs and add tomato puree

563
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,860
A fresh experience of eating with a bowl

564
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,510
It should be surprising

565
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,420
Is it still far away?

566
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,440
Still a long way off

567
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,640
Meat powder plus soybean powder

568
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,860
Mix almost all the powders in the world together

569
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,470
Now waiting for the skilled hands to make

570
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,510
It is the centerpiece of today's banquet.

571
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,450
knew

572
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,150
What are you doing?

573
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,780
You have to use as much strength as I do.

574
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,490
This is the joint for the shoulder and wrist

575
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,850
Very bad action

576
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,610
Let you come with force, force

577
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,720
Use your shoulders and wrists to mix the powder.

578
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,140
master

579
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,680
All ready

580
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,530
Yeah

581
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,680
OK

582
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,010
It would be a shame if there was no meat at the banquet.

583
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,350
Plus the unconventional hamburger meat

584
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,970
Staple food completed

585
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,920
This is a comprehensive food

586
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,510
Starving for a year

587
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,390
The red color of this product, called the sweet of the year

588
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,120
It is also what the Japanese soldiers are pursuing.

589
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,160
How can it be so soft?

590
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,500
Steak?

591
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:04,800
How is it possible?

592
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,760
The meat is clearly out of reach.

593
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,930
I mean, people won't have meat during their hunger period.

594
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,400
In the words of the Qing Dynasty

595
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,140
There is a saying that dragon meat is in the sky and donkey meat is on the ground

596
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,240
Here is one more reason.

597
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,000
barley

598
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:26,970
bean

599
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,000
Soft Shell Meat

600
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,940
Belly

601
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,290
Put together,

602
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,120
Wheat Bean Soft Belly

603
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,350
McDonald's

604
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,820
Just like real meat

605
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,380
The taste is also very good and very filling

606
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,520
Can you still say that?

607
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,900
It's done

608
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,540
Pre-made pigments plus decoration

609
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,010
A treat for the eyes

610
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,810
The point of dessert is

611
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,440
Enjoy it with your eyes and mouth

612
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,080
This color

613
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,500
If you add a little surprise on top of that

614
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,200
The perfect party ending

615
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,010
(Baochun Yokan)

616
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,200
Although it is beautiful
(Baochun Yokan)

617
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,310
Although it is beautiful

618
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,000
But it's just the yokan that you can eat very often.

619
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,870
It seems that this magical scene has to be seen to the end.

620
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,990
This is not just convenient to eat

621
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,370
It is also a fortune-telling item with fortune written on it.

622
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,650
Because I embrace spring

623
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,160
So it is called Spring Yokan

624
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,150
The beautiful wish that your future will be spring

625
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,510
As the party ends

626
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,770
Check your fortune.

627
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,650
What fortune is this inauspicious in a sacred job?

628
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,030
(One more)

629
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,330
One more

630
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,920
Another one?

631
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,020
Next opportunity

632
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,280
(Next chance)
Next opportunity

633
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,560
(Next chance)

634
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,170
(null)

635
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,650
My waist My waist

636
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,400
I'm going to die.

637
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,700
Seriously, alternative materials

638
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,560
Put my soul in it

639
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Oh, I'm dying.

640
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,860
Did it. Did it.

641
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,440
Did it. Did it.

642
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,040
Do you know what I'm thinking now?

643
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,720
I know I feel the same way.

644
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,590
Fish cakes. I'm thinking of fish cakes now.

645
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,150
The Imperial Chef Who Was Almost Killed by Qin Shi Huang

646
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,360
Invented fish cakes the night before

647
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,400
I thought it was just luck but it wasn't

648
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,920
It must have come to mind after the last struggle

649
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,400
Inspiration for those who give up

650
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,270
It's not something that comes easily.

651
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,320
MILF

652
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,010
I'm going to be angry.

653
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,720
Drink this to moisten your throat

654
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
Her surname is Han

655
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,550
Your last name is Han, right?

656
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,510
Yes

657
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,340
The name is Shimeng Han Shimeng

658
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,020
Why is Shi Meng's name so exotic?

659
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,920
Han Shenmeng

660
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,260
Yes

661
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,920
But what is this

662
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,930
Nothing is a queen

663
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,920
I happened to leave the palace and go to Han's house

664
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,350
I looked through his family tree.

665
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,530
It is indeed a fake family tree bought with money.

666
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:47,280
Very much like Han Shizhang's ancestors

667
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,110
Because it's a fake yangban class, I won't bring them with me.

668
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,910
They use this dirty trick to pull the strings

669
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,260
My lady, now is not the time.

670
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
If you're away for too long, something bad will happen.

671
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,960
Yes, yes, Choi Sang-Gong has worked hard.

672
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,340
Let's go.

673
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,250
Madam, slow down.

674
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:02,940
Go fast

675
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:03,640
Niangniang

676
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,970
MILF

677
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,550
What happened?

678
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,720
Now there's something going on in my stomach

679
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,980
Folk art farm music performance

680
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,640
What happened?

681
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,570
So the water hasn't been thrown away yet?

682
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,210
What is that water?

683
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,660
That's water mixed with poisonous weeds.

684
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,310
Poison

685
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,270
Choi Sang-Gong

686
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,820
Here it comes

687
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,750
Yes, of course I'll come.

688
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,230
This is a banquet to celebrate the recovery of the nave.

689
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,280
Watch carefully from now on

690
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,110
What consequences will your actions have?

691
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,220
Cooking is not an ordinary thing.

692
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,180
There is no place that doesn't hurt

693
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,070
Plus, the head chef is good at suppressing me.

694
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,590
This is damn

695
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,850
Come on, come on

696
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,610
Any more potatoes to shave?

697
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,210
Choi Sang-Gong, please save Choi Sang-Gong.

698
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,770
Thanks for your hard work

699
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,310
sorry

700
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,160
Wearing a ghost mask with an old scar on the jaw

701
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:23,090
Excuse me

702
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,850
Wait a moment

703
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,100
sorry

704
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,800
It's not that you look so uncomfortable

705
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,590
Give me acupuncture and moxibustion

706
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,200
Prescribe the antidote again.

707
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,490
Don't interfere.

708
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,480
I'm the leader here.

709
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,830
Okay, okay.

710
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,490
This is a stinky hand in the royal kitchen

711
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,770
In the hospital, it's the golden hand.

712
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,200
There is a place for everything, for people.

713
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,210
But the big needle is more suitable for the royal kitchen.

714
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,410
Said it wasn't

715
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,870
There is nothing better than a big needle to prick potatoes

716
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,600
I'll use this.

717
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,270
What can't you touch?

718
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,110
Scraped potatoes are better.

719
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,340
I'll use these.

720
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,700
No, no, no

721
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,590
hot

722
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,390
Niangniang

723
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,760
The music in my stomach has stopped now.

724
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,230
Now is not the time

725
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,280
Niangniang

726
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,430
Choi Sang-Gung

727
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,630
It's not impossible to recover so quickly.

728
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,400
Strong Woman

729
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,410
Damn

730
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,450
Oily smell

731
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,660
Why did you take so long?

732
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,170
that

733
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,370
sorry

734
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,660
It was my hand that slipped and shot the arrow towards the nave.

735
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,490
No injuries anywhere?

736
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,710
Yes no

737
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,300
Hunting is just tiring.

738
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,820
Fell asleep while changing clothes

739
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,240
Really

740
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,390
apron

741
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,910
When did the Queen Mother prepare?

742
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,560
Wait

743
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,590
Your Highness has worked so hard to prepare this banquet.

744
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,820
Now is the time to highlight His Highness

745
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,950
I would like to take this opportunity to

746
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,670
Because I understand that people are hungry and don't want to be full

747
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,200
Those who set an example for scholars say

748
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,160
We will implement a reduced meal plan starting from today's banquet

749
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,540
(Reduce the amount of food on the imperial table and set an example for the people)
We will implement a reduced meal plan starting from today's banquet

751
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,000
Reduced Meal

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,600
(Reduce the amount of food on the imperial table and set an example for the people)

753
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:10,620
What does this mean?
(Reduce the amount of food on the imperial table and set an example for the people)

754
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,430
What does this mean?

755
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,220
The king has always been in times of difficulty for the country.

756
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,990
Reducing food on the royal table

757
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,050
Share the suffering with the people

758
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,560
The purpose of reducing food intake is to share the difficulties faced by the country

759
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,690
Things to solve together

760
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,620
Like now

761
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,210
Food that can save dozens of people

762
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,330
It is a sin to become a piece of meat to please the tongue

763
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,330
So no matter who is in the palace

764
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,700
Bringing meat to the table will be punished

765
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,630
Not only meat, but also a sumptuous table is prohibited

766
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:53,590
Ministers are no longer allowed to enjoy drinking, singing and dancing

767
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,810
Stop the partisanship

768
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,900
If you disobey, it will be understood as a willingness to be punished.

769
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,390
Your Highness

770
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,350
Minister Jin Zuogen is terrified

771
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,130
Will report the sad news

772
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,800
They all hide their identities.

773
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,220
Criminals hiding in the Guards

774
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,690
To be by your side and protect you

775
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,370
So I created a fake identity.

776
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,330
When I got there, I twisted off the head and hid it.

777
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,680
It's time for pheasant neck

778
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,740
I should think that they are the backbone of strength that I have cultivated.

779
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,910
To uproot them and tear them into pieces

780
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,540
So that they can no longer get up

781
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,480
In such a good occasion

782
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,580
What are you doing?

783
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,260
Do you know what their true identity is?

784
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,960
A family with a rebellious background

785
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,380
A thief who robbed the literati

786
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,290
A person wanted for using critical writings in the public

787
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,300
They are all people who are dissatisfied with the court.

788
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,540
Hiding his identity

789
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,260
I will guard you by your side.

790
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,510
This was created for the purpose of rebellion.

791
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,820
Because this matter is very serious and urgent

792
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,660
I'm in such a hurry

793
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,660
impossible

794
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,170
This is someone's murder.

795
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,160
My warrior guard creates a flaw

796
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,250
A trick to threaten me

797
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,240
Someone's words

798
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,970
Who exactly are you referring to?

799
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,820
For example, General Kim Jakeun

800
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,180
Murphy

801
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,010
Do you believe in the backers of those three families?

802
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,030
Just a few words

803
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,550
Do you really think they'll stand behind you?

804
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,690
How stupid!

805
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,400
Please wake up from the illusion

806
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,540
Bold

807
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,980
How dare a mere official insult me?

808
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:23,630
This is beyond disloyalty and is treason

809
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,010
You are very unlike His Highness now.

810
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,150
Please calm down

811
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,470
How dare you order me, the king,

812
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:42,970
Your Highness, it seems like you have someone else you trust.

813
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,510
But if the limbs are cut off

814
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,480
That thing is useless.

815
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,140
Please forgive me for not being able to defeat the hot-blooded

816
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,420
And pay the price

817
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,820
The criminals were beheaded

818
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,340
Your Highness

819
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,710
I will use military law to control

820
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,580
Those who are plotting rebellion are no longer under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Guard.

821
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,730
So it has to be handled by the Yijinfu

822
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,210
Your Highness

823
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,120
Should the Guard Battalion handle this?

824
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,360
No, Your Highness

825
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,220
The Royal Guards General

826
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,540
Now you know the identities of these people, right?

827
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,800
It's possible that all the guards are rebels.

828
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,270
Violations of the Guards Camp will be dealt with in the Guards Camp

829
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,240
This is inappropriate.

830
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,080
Please think twice, Your Highness.

831
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,470
Please think twice, Your Highness.

832
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:56,810
Disband the Guards

833
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,720
It is possible that the Royal Guards General will also be implicated.

834
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,560
but

835
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,790
If you will deal with sinners

836
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,280
If you give me carte blanche

837
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,740
From now on, Your Highness, you must abide by your promise not to do anything

838
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,960
I'll stop here.

839
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,960
It turns out everything

840
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,590
It's useless.

841
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,410
What are you going to do, Your Highness?

842
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,080
knew

843
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:11,750
I've given full authority to the training general.

844
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,500
Pray to the four gods who rule the land

845
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,030
and the god of millet, who is in charge of the five grains

846
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,490
The Grace of Siam Vientiane

847
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:49,000
The seeds planted in the ground grew luxuriantly.

848
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,620
Willing to serve the people

849
01:03:52,180 --> 01:04:00,150
Live without hunger thanks to the mercy of God

850
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,720
Please

851
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,130
Your Highness

852
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,430
Your Highness

853
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,270
(Preview of the next episode)

854
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:41,810
Hearing loss due to the explosion

855
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,610
cut

856
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,710
There must be no problem.

857
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,470
Of course

858
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,050
No one else

859
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,990
I chose the way to live

860
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,160
So you don't die either.

861
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,770
Dust off quickly.

862
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:52,830
Let me hit you on the back of the head

863
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:53,960
What's even more frightening is

864
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,590
The Enemy Within

865
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,350
Niangniang

866
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,480
His Highness

867
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,670
His Highness, that's him, right?

868
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,100
I request to withdraw my power from behind the scenes

869
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,000
Lord

870
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,580
It was this entire palace that killed Kim So-yong
