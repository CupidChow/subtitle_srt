1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,940


2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,220
   
    

3
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,210
   

4
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,970
  If you don't feel comfortable saying it, how about our own secret sign, 

5
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,040
  - lIke this? 
 - What does that mean? 

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,600
 It means what I'm saying right now is a lie. 

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,210
  That's what it means. How about it? It's not hard. 

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,000
  I see. The king doesn't lie. 

9
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,890
   

10
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,190
This little one hasn't done anything wrong!

11
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,370
 The smell of alcohol and a strange fragrance... 

12
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,980
 She didn't drink poison. 

13
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,850
With these tiny hands,

14
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,570
how could you make her drink poison?

15
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,040
 Her hands are warm. She's alive! 

16
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,380
It can't be!

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,590
Dam-hyang!

18
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,870
Goodness...

19
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,980
- Sir. 
 - You're here.

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
Here you go.

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,470
We can't just dump her on the mountain.

22
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,560
I will only be comfortable holding a funeral for her.

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,670
There.

24
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,910
- Then farewell.. 
 - Farewell.

25
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,420
What happened to Dam-hyang? She's all right, isn't she?

26
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,530
She probably has made it safely out of the palace by now.

27
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,820
I've petitioned for her mother to be released as a government slave,

28
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,620
so that they can live together away from Hanyang.

29
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,840
She's going to meet up with her mother!

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,770
She was so worried that her mother only had four fingernails...

31
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,890
I'm so happy for her! It's great!

32
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,680
How did you do it? Did you use sleeping medicine?

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,770
I made her drink a paralytic concoction.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, the thing that Great Physician, Hua Ta, used during surgery?

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,320
You know about it?

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,630
Of course, I do. I watched "Three Kingdoms for Children" many times.

37
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,040
Three Kingdoms for...?

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,320
But you should have told me your plan sooner.

39
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,900
It was an urgent situation and too dangerous for many to know.

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,340
Did you receive news from Byeolgam Hong?

41
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,950
Yes, Sire. The child escaped safely.

42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,360
Great job.

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,410
Putting your life at risk to save one servant was reckless.

44
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,280
She's not just a servant.

45
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,960
If I were to give up on that child,

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,210
it would become too easy giving up 10 or 100,

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,550
or all my subjects in the future.

48
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,010
  Cheoljong... Here, I thought he was just an idiot. 

49
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,460
 He's a total idiot! 

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,630
Don't think such amazing thoughts. You won't live long.

51
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,240
It's not my goal to live a long, shameful life.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,710
Those are some great values that will help shorten your lifespan!

53
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,850
- Who do you think would do this— 
 - She's saying "thank you."

54
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,640
Her words are vastly different from those of others.

55
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,450
The Queen's Dictionary is useless! How full it is with your liberal and incorrect translations!

56
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,730
- Did you see it? 
 - You put it there for me to see.

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,150
By the way, was the queen's position always this dangerous?

58
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,370
Why is everyone out to get me?

59
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,510
I will make sure something like this doesn't happen again.

60
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,710
No, I'm going to do it my way.

61
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,640
The best defense is to attack.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,860
 From today on, the crazy bitch in this palace is me. 

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,020
   

64
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,320
Did you try to get rid of the queen?

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,400
The queen is the king's person.

66
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,850
She handed over her clan's embarrassment and weakness to the king.

67
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,960
She fell for the king and turned her back on her own clan.

68
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,240
There is no way that's possible.

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
I know you don't want to believe it.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,140
The fact that the queen you worship so much

71
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,720
is just a foolish woman who struggles with the love for a man.

72
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,750
Ever since the moment I stepped into this house,

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,400
I have done everything possible to receive recognition from you, Father.

74
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,460
It wasn't only so I could remain in this household.

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,990
I wanted to be like you

76
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,610
and respect you.

77
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,910
However, the moment you tried to harm the queen,

78
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,030
you were no longer my father.

79
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,140
Whoever tries to lay a hand on the queen,

80
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,990
will lose their life.

81
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,810
Return home whenever you wish.

82
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,610
Even if you do not see me as a father,

83
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,730
to me, you will always be my son.

84
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,610
 Who could it be? The person who hid the ledger in Daejojeon. 

85
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,340
 The most likely candidates are these two people who hold a grudge against me, although I've done nothing against them. 

86
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,560
 Queen Dowager Jo and Jo Hwa-jin. 

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,890
 In terms of motive, Jo Hwa-jin is likely to be the culprit. 

88
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,590
Thinking of her vigor during Surit-nal, it's undoubtedly her.

89
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,200
But Jo Hwa-jin hasn't come to Daejojeon lately at all.

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,280
Thinking of movement, then the culprit should be Queen Dowager Jo.

91
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,540
 Here... 

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,370
It's suspicious that she has recently visited me more frequently than ever.

93
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,460
And for sure, Queen Dowager Jo also has a clear motive.

94
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,480
Then indeed, is it Queen Dowager Jo?  What a racoon-like...

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,620
If so, how could that ledger possibly fall into Queen Dowager Jo's hands?

96
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,270
That is the mystery.

97
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,010
By the way, what is this ledger exactly?

98
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,800
I didn't hold any shamanistic ritual today, though.

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,130
I apologize for my ill manners the other day.

100
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,220
I don't think you lower your head for no reason.

101
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,730
What is the reason?

102
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,750
As expected, Your Highness the Queen Dowager

103
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,840
catches on quickly.

104
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,170
I thank you for agreeing to come to this difficult meeting.

105
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,600
You might have realized based on today's events,

106
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,130
now is the time to save the noble class first, rather than your own family clan.

107
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,660
If you don't have lips, your teeth will suffer. 
  (T/N: meaning the inseparable relationship of two parties) 

108
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,210
If any one of these two families gets ruined,

109
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,100
it won't be easy for the other to be intact either.

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,820
Therefore, I'd like to suggest "Grand Pardons"

111
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,990
for the promise of concord between our two families. 
 - Grand Pardons?

112
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,170
Both clans have many family members with talent

113
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,860
who lost their governmental posts just because of some momentary mistakes.

114
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,680
So, with "Grand Pardons,"

115
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,460
we are going to pardon those talents' crimes.

116
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,440
So, it's a kind of token to signify the promise as well as a congratulatory gift.

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,400
What do you think?

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,010
Would you like to come together?

119
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,090
 Although it was the Minister of Military who committed the embezzlement single-handedly,  

120
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,780
 I can't say that my sin not to control him properly is small either.  

121
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,190
 Therefore, I, your humble subject, Kim Jwa-geun,  

122
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,400
 is requesting your approval to allow me to resign from being General of Military Training... 

123
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,850
This is not the end for me.

124
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,460
As long as I am alive.

125
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,990
Eat slowly.

126
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,070
Are these side dishes enough for you?

127
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,160
If I were shameful, the food shouldn't be going down this easily.

128
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,650
Why on earth did you run away?

129
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm sure that I provided for you plenty during your time here.

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,070
That's because—

131
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,110
Mother?

132
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,890
Mother.

133
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,410
You did well, my Dam-hyang. You did well.

134
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,030
Mother.

135
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,910
It's all right.

136
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
It's all right.

137
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,590
We should at least do our best and smile,

138
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,900
so Her Majesty won't be sad endlessly.

139
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes.

140
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,170
 Your Majesty, it's time to wake up. 

141
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,400
Your Majesty.

142
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,170
Were you not able to sleep at all?

143
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,930
What will we do if your body falls ill?

144
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,750
I had too many thoughts so I wasn't able to sleep.

145
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,100
By the way, they probably slept well right?

146
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
Who are you referring to?

147
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,290
The people who threw such big shit my way.

148
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,150
Last night will be the last time they sleep in peace.

149
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,600
So I hope they slept well.

150
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,610
- Court Lady Choi. 
 - Yes.

151
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,120
Send someone to my father and tell him I want to see him here.

152
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

153
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,030
 Your Majesty, your father is here. 

154
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,900
Already?

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,250
I was just about to go find you.

156
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,030
I see you came to me instead.

157
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

158
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,920
I came to see you on my own.

159
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,620
- Last time— 
 - Last time—

160
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
Oh, you first.

161
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,990
- No, no you first, Your Majesty. 
 - No, Father, you speak first.

162
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,750
- I apologize for last time. 
 - I apologize for last time.

163
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,330
- No, no, I'm sorry. 
 - No, no, I'm sorry. It's all right.

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,200
They say you can't deceive your own blood.

165
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
You're right.

166
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,780
I—

167
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,090
The reason I wanted to see you... is because of the ledger.

168
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,870
You knew?

169
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,530
Everyone seems to be freaking out because of it. What kind of ledger is it?

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,420
The wrongful actions of our clan are recorded in there.

171
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,160
 The Ansong family's records. That's why Cheoljong was trying to retrieve it. 

172
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,310
I also came to talk to you about the ledger.

173
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,770
The ledger disappeared during your stay with the king.

174
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,310
I have been suspecting the king thus far.

175
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,560
However, recently one of my trusted servants ran away from home.

176
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,330
Thankfully he was caught and when I asked him why he ran away he said

177
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,950
the night before the ledger disappeared, he let Eui Bin into the house.

178
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,870
As our whole house was being flipped upside down,

179
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,260
he ran away thinking some kind of trouble happened so I only just recently found out.

180
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,600
I apologize, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,870
This isn't something you need to apologize for, Father.

182
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,320
Now I see,

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,410
the puzzle is complete.

184
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm sorry?

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,070
 Sister Sunwon (Grand Queen Dowager), who personally f***ed me over.  

186
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,920
 Today, I prepared ice more valuable than gold.  

187
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,460
 Queen Dowager Jo, who got around to f***ing me over.  

188
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,810
 - I will serve you soon— 
 - I need to try it now. 

189
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,250
 And Jo Hwa-jin, who made this all very f***ed-up.  

190
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,260
 You tell the king yourself. 

191
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,140
 Is that a threat? 

192
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,490
 I completely understand 

193
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,980
 what you want.  

194
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,620
Father, there's somewhere I need to go.

195
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,670
Where?

196
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,890
To open up the gates of hell.

197
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,570
 I'll show you all 

198
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,790
 exactly who you messed with.  

199
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,700
My daughter, who used to be like a sika deer.

200
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,530
How could she change this much when she hasn't even been that long in the palace?

201
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,380
I know they say that parents don't know their child,

202
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,640
but a sika deer?

203
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,690
If you had to compare her to an animal it should be a wild horse.

204
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,200
My daughter is a wild horse?

205
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,980
  A Māori clan tattoo, a peacock feather, 

206
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,910
 and a Devil wearing Prada. 

207
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,440
 Things that are strong are beautiful. 

208
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,490
  Today, I am wearing the world's most beautiful battle armor. 

209
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,360
How is it?

210
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,050
I like it. Revenge is fun when it's glamorous.

211
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,180
   

212
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,090
What do you think you're doing right now?

213
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,200
Not everything is as it seems.

214
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,390
If you want to know what's inside, you must cut the stomach in half.

215
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,400
I thought it was a potato as it seemed,

216
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,290
but you completely deceived me.

217
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,330
It's not right to cut it open blindly without trust, is it?

218
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,090
You should first check whether it's a potato or a sweet potato before cutting it open.

219
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Now, you can never restore it, can you?

220
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,050
 Here is the beverage, Your Majesty. 

221
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,350
The reason why I prepared this brunch today is

222
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,650
because I'd like to return the precious thing

223
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,050
that Your Royal Highness bestowed on me.

224
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,170
How nice the taste of the beverage was, from last time!

225
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,070
It was so nice you wouldn't have noticed even if the person next to you died while drinking it together.

226
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,980
Please try it.

227
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,330
I'm not thirsty though.

228
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,850
Considering my effort to prepare it, why don't you at least taste it?

229
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,600
I said I don't want to!

230
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
I've gone through a lot to prepare it, though.

231
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,030
Well, if you say so...

232
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,280
Indeed, ice tastes the best when I crush it with my teeth.

233
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,530
I told you before,

234
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,950
that I would help you every day so that you can stay young and healthy for all your life.

235
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm thinking to keep doing my best going forward.

236
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,000
When one begins to suspect everything, including food, drinks, and cosmetics,

237
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,090
her life will become like hell soon, you know.

238
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,440
Since your husband started his own rule, you're now acting up, trusting in his power.

239
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,710
Do you think your position as queen is still safe when you turn your back on your clan?

240
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,190
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager,

241
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,350
neither the clan nor my husband is what I'm trusting.

242
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm acting up because I'm trusting myself.

243
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,280
- Ah, that's right, Head Eunuch.  
 - Yes, Your Majesty?

244
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,740
For a while, I've neglected my work to focus my study on producing my heir.

245
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,270
How neglectful I've been in my king's role.

246
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,610
So, hurry up and go report back.

247
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:23,110
R-Report back...  Your Majesty, to whom are you referring to...

248
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,330
You know... the person you always go report back to.

249
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,210
Oh, you bastard!  You know what your sin is!

250
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,400
Your Majesty! I've committed a grave sin, please kill me.

251
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,300
What's wrong with you? I wasn't talking to you.

252
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,310
Now, my life is yours, Your Majesty.

253
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,280
I don't need such a thing.  Where could I possibly use your life?

254
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,200
Please... Please kill me, Your Majesty.

255
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,100
Oh, dear! I told you, I don't need it.

256
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,340
Head Eunuch, what else can you possibly do? You had to do whatever your superior ordered you to do.

257
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,870
Please, I'd rather you get angry at me, Your Majesty.

258
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,500
You're scarier this way...

259
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,240
With such a weak nerve, what kind of spy can you be?

260
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,060
I have to stop by somewhere before the council meeting.

261
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,140
Head Eunuch, go to Injeongjeon first. 
   (The Great Throne Hall) 

262
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,360
Oh, dear! Read that kind of thing secretly.  Our dear Head Eunuch was so shocked.

263
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,020
   

264
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,450
Have you been well overnight?

265
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,810
Do you think that's the proper attitude to greet an elder with?

266
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,690
Since the accessories on my hairpiece are so heavy, I can't lower my head.

267
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,980
This is a sacred place where we hold rituals for previous kings.

268
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,540
What I'm saying is that it's a discourtesy to come here donning such extravagant style.

269
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,220
If you want to get a refund, you should dress up as much as possible. That's the common rule.

270
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh my, look at me! I forgot to light incense for the former king.

271
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,750
Dear me, smearing my certificate from Cheonghak Manner School...

272
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,820
Please stop.

273
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,800
I usually follow Confucianism thoroughly,

274
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,580
so I can't help myself if I'm not following the protocol of manners.

275
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,470
I told you, don't touch it—

276
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,680
There is an item you left behind in my room.

277
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,900
You frequently visited me without notice and invaded my privacy,

278
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,350
but ultimately, that was the reason.

279
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,820
What are you doing now?

280
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,050
I told you, getting a refund.

281
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,630
I should return the big f*** I received.

282
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,050
Where did you learn this kind of ill manners?

283
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,330
You recklessly slander your elder and talk back at every word.

284
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,270
You were always arrogant, but today you are even worse!

285
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,280
Indeed, you can't hide the fact that you grew up without a mother, is that it?

286
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,240
What the... Mother-in-Law!

287
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,700
If I'm mannerless because I grew up without a mother,

288
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,310
then are you mannerless because you're living without any children, Old Woman?

289
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,840
Gosh, it's hot!

290
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,650
Ah, I was too pissed off to endure those hot things.

291
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,150
I almost burned up that royal portrait of your dear son.

292
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,010
My Queen! You've gone crazy!

293
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,530
Of course, I've gone crazy.  Very much, at that.

294
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,310
Among all these crazy bitches, I think I'm the craziest one.

295
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,780
So, you'd better watch out.

296
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,060
If you touch even a single hair of mine...

297
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,590
you will never be able to see your son's face again.

298
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,140
It's not the queen I should worry about, but other people.

299
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,630
The best defense is to attack, she said.

300
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,470
    
 Aigoo, I didn't see our dear Eui Bin there.

301
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,900
How dim your presence is.

302
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm going to skip stones. Will you join me?

303
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,700
You can enjoy it by yourself.

304
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,110
The ledger. I know you took it.

305
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,470
Thanks to that ledger, I almost died too.

306
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,220
Tell me.

307
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,730
Is that what you want?

308
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,510
Did you really not kill Oh-wol?

309
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,170
No matter what I say, you only believe whatever you want to believe.

310
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,180
You believe I'm trying to steal the king from you and I killed Oh-wol and put her body in the well.

311
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,310
Only then, I'll be the evil bitch who deserves to die.

312
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,160
Because you're the kind and pitiful victim, right?

313
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,980
This is why cosplaying a victim is scary, because you don't even realize... you're becoming a monster.

314
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,200
Look in the mirror and see how hideous you are.

315
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:25,340
Grab me yourself and pull yourself up, because I'm not in a generous mood right now.

316
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,600
When I fell into the lake in front of your eyes,

317
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:54,170
maybe you could've grabbed me too, don't you think?

318
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,590
With this, I've proved that I'm a better person than you are.

319
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:15,050


320
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,060
Kim Jwa-geun, the former General of Military Training, 
    

321
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,020
resigned himself?

322
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,980
The process of his impeachment was getting delayed, so I was just about to hold all you ministers responsible for it.

324
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,150
What a shame... (I didn't get to do that).

325
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,400
Oh dear, that was a slip of my tongue.  I was going to say, "What a relief."

326
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,700
- The next agenda item is— 
 - Today, there is something I must proclaim in front of you.

327
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,890
I'm making a government office to set the disorder of the three major tax systems right.  (Land/Military duty/Government loans) 

328
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,300
Its name will be Office of Correction for the Three Taxes.

329
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,160
Office of Correction for the Three Taxes?

330
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,520
It will make the law relevant to this issue and prepare the solution to correct the fundamental problems.

331
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,770
Its role will be to straighten out the three major tax systems.

332
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,820
Joseon is a country where people live off agriculture.  Farmers must survive first for the country to survive.

333
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,360
Therefore, a local government official's exploitation of them is an act that ruins this country.

334
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,940
So going forward, that will be punished as severely as treason.

335
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,030
We must be cautious when we install a new kind of government office.

336
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,450
So, first, after listening to our thoughts, the ministers—

337
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,360
When we carry out a rightful deed, there shouldn't be any compromise.

338
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,680
What I'm saying is that I will no longer try to please you ministers.

339
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,840
In addition, my ancestor, King Sunjong's name will be

340
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,620
promoted to King Sunjo, following the rule of  "Jo for contribution and Jong for virtue." 

341
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,500
Today of all days, the king is very aggressive.

342
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,850
Your Majesty, today there is a new appointment to be announced.

343
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:24,620
Royal Secretary, your tongue also slipped.  It should be "the suggestion of appointment."

344
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,070
The seat of Minister of Military is vacant now,

345
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,560
but the crisis in military power can be led to the crisis in the country.

346
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,940
Therefore, we've confirmed this appointment urgently through the emergency committee.

347
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,950
Minister of Military, enter the room.

348
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:09,800
I, Kim Byeong-in, Minister of the Military, greet Your Majesty.

349
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,580
What's scary about Kim Byeong-in is that he can even embrace the Jo family.

350
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,010
Numerous appeals to demanding the Grand Pardons are pouring in from both families.

351
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,710
That must also be Kim Byeong-in's action.

352
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,950
It won't be easy to ignore so many appeals like those, eh?

353
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,630
If it goes wrong, this might give an excuse to the entire noble community to protest.

354
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,480
Since your own rule began, we can do what we wanted to do,

355
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
but it's still hard to stop what we don't like.

356
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,680
It's true that the best defense is to attack.

357
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,930
Now, the key is who will make a faster and more fatal attack, rather than keeping in check.

358
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,870
We don't have time to find the right people.

359
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,480
For the Director of Office of Correction for the Three Taxes, Brother, please take that position.

360
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,720
Officer Hong, you should take the role of the royal inspector, specially appointed by me

361
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,570
and travel around investigating the three provinces where the public unrest is.

362
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,550
So, it's a business trip to the countryside again.

363
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,250
Please do your best.

364
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,180
Why is it that you two are more often staying in the palace ordering me around with your words

365
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,980
while I'm running around by myself.  Is it just me feeling that?

366
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,460
What do you mean, by yourself?  Always, my thoughts are with—

367
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
Once your mission as the royal inspector is completed, a vacation might—

368
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
I'll work on the preparations for the business trip.

369
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,360
M-Might be...   I said a vacation might be given to you.

370
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,990
I'm sure that he didn't hear the rest of the sentence.

371
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,540
How foolish he is...

372
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,930
Your... Majesty... The queen... letter...

373
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,320
I'm not going to bite you, come over here.

374
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,830
H-Her Majesty the Q-Queen sent a letter.

375
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,830
Are you not feeling well?

376
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,000
You're too weak...

377
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,370
The thing called revenge is... I thought it would feel as if a burden would be lifted off.

378
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,290
But it really feels like that.  So thrilling!

379
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,870
His Majesty the King arri—

380
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,670
You're here?

381
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,050
You look especially glamorous today.  This style also suits you well.

382
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,520
At first, fashion isn't complete until the face is done. Now, whatever it is I'm wearing, it suits me well.

383
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,380
Who knew that even the body of a queen would look good on me.

384
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,250
I really can't get used to this.

385
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,990
The reason I wanted to see you was...

386
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,660
to form an alliance.

387
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,930
My clan must have abandoned me, thinking we're already allies anyway.

388
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,550
So, I have nothing to lose here, do I?

389
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,830
Becoming my ally means that you will become the Kim family's enemy.

390
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,060
Since my clan abandoned me first,

391
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,490
now it's my turn to abandon them.

392
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,960
If we share the same enemy, aren't we allies?

393
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,750
♫  If it feels like nothing goes as you wish  ♫

394
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,950
♫  Don't think anything else, but just listen to this  ♫

395
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,020
♫  I'm Patrasche who can eat only by running crazy in this life  ♫

396
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,900
So be it.

397
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,790
From now on, you and are no longer in a "no touch" situation.

398
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,150
Okay, from now on, "no touch" is forbidden.

399
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,330
♫  For the goal, ye, run like a rabbit, so hurry, to me  ♫

400
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,190
According to martial arts movies, they usually put drops of their blood in alcohol and drink together.

401
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,600
But in this era, such an unhygienic method is a bit of a no-no,

402
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,630
so let's just drink tea and share the camaraderie of allies, simple and pure.

403
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,240
♫  Think back about myself before blaming the world  ♫

404
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,950
♫  If I change, the world will change too  ♫

405
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,120
- This is... the camaraderie of allies?  
 - Yup.

406
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,630
This is how it's usually done. Bottoms up!

407
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,270
Oh, well...

408
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,390
♫  Even if you fall, don't settle, stand up again  ♫

409
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,310
Now we've formed an alliance, so let's get rid of some bothersome questions before moving on.

410
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,600
Why did you try to kill me?

411
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,830
You're right.

412
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,080
As this is a matter we must discuss one day.

413
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,400
I thought you eavesdropped on our discussion about assassinating your father.

414
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,970
Even so, how could you... He's your father-in-law.

415
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,070
To me, he was just one of the corrupted people.

416
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:11,400
What a heartless bastard.  But then again, it's not surprising since you were trying to kill your wife, too.

417
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,870
You're a serious killer of your wife's family.

418
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm sorry.

419
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Although these excuses seem meaningless now,

420
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,220
there were many misunderstandings and circumstances.

421
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Okay.

422
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,380
Then, you now owe me one.  Until you pay me back that debt, you're not forgiven.

423
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,550
So what are you trying to do?  Strengthen royal authority?

424
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,820
Royal authority is just a tool to fix this broken country of Joseon.

425
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,980
I believe that the world never changes fundamentally.

426
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,830
So, to be honest, I like your tool more than your goal.

427
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,340
If your royal authority is strengthened, I'll become more powerful, too,

428
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,810
and then they won't be able to touch me as they please.

429
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,300
I'm well aware of the fear that the threat of death causes.

430
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,830
Although you pretend to be strong, in fact, I'm sure you're afraid.

431
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,080
I don't know... Maybe it's because I already died once,

432
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,930
but I hate getting stepped on more than dying.

433
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,790
As long as I can chew and shred those shoes which are trying to stomp me to death,

434
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,520
even if I have to die, I will probably die smiling.

435
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,230
Your Majesty, it's time to cook a meal for Grand Queen Dowager.

436
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,950
Oh, in the same vein,

437
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm taking my leave to go chew.

438
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,560
 I will die smiling. 

439
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Die smiling...

440
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,170
My Lord, My Queen's father.

441
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,360
Oh, oh, Byeong-in.

442
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,500
No, our dear Lord Minister of the Military.

443
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,760
- Are you teasing me?  
 - No way, how could I?

444
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,880
Please call me comfortably as you always do.

445
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,330
To be honest, I've waited for you,

446
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,690
as there is something to tell you about the queen, my So-yong.

447
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,840
I also have something to tell you regarding Her Majesty the Queen.

448
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,720
Where did I put it?

449
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,160
Where is it?

450
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,520
I saw it.

451
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,320
You rascal!

452
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,930
You haven't worked in this royal kitchen long. How dare you use that knife already!

453
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,250
Well, we didn't behave like that when we were young.

454
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,800
These days, even if I ask the young cooks to go for a drink after work,

455
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,350
they are always running away, saying they don't want to.

456
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,460
Geez, why do they hate drinking with me when I'm buying for them?

457
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,760
I feel the same, I can't really understand the young palace maids these days either.

458
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,880
When I tell them to come about 2 hours late, they really come 2 hours late.

459
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,510
Oh, dear!  They should've come at least 15 minutes earlier.

460
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,780
- Those young kids these days... 
 - Those young kids these days...

461
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,740
To Tongmyeongjeong. 
   (Grand Queen Dowager's quarters) 

462
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,480
What the... There is one more revenge match left.

463
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,600
Revenge pancake? 
  (Both "match" and "pancake" share same phonetic word - "jeon") 

464
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,810
 It would be better to pay back in kind, wouldn't it? 

465
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,860
 A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, and a eunuch for a eunuch... 

466
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,300
Then... Bracken?  Job's tears? 
 (T/N: Traditionally thought to decrease virility)  

467
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,400
Bracken and Job's tears... This pancake uses a lot of ingredients that are good for health.

468
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,020
 But by feeding them, what time will it be done? That's a long term plan taking too much time.  

469
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,690
Let's go wild.

470
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,580
Castration.

471
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,510
Castration?  I've never heard of such an ingredi—

472
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,940
Ah, castration.  Using such a rare ingredient...

473
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,380
I didn't come to burden you.

474
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,630
I am a man who knows how to give up.

475
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,150
I'm sorry.

476
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,180
Don't be, please.

477
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,730
For the last time, may I ask you one thing?

478
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,590
- Yes.  
 - My Lady, why...

479
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,580
why do you not like a man with ambition?

480
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,600
While living in the palace, I've known too many men with ambition,

481
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,320
and even the difficult end those men had.

482
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,860
I find that scary and undesirable.

483
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,320
Thank you for answering my question.

484
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,530
If I can dare to wish something for you, My Lady,

485
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,080
I wish...

486
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,540
that your bright smile lasts forever.

487
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,620
Oh, my friend.

488
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,160
- It's over, isn't it? 
 - Everyone knows you have senses as sharp as a sickle.

489
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,680
You're really quick at sensing things.

490
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,550
When you cry like this, who wouldn't know?

491
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,250
Don't look at me.

492
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,660
I don't want to show my state like this to anyone.

493
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:01,290
Then, go over there and cry there by yourself.  People might think that I made you cry.

494
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,110
No, it's not me.

495
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,300
I will no longer cry.

496
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,150
Giving up my feelings cleanly is also a part of love, isn't it?

497
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,950
Maybe it's something harder to do than continuing to love.

498
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,590
You're almost like a poet.

499
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,950
Let's go.  Stop crying!

500
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,440
So she insisted on serving this table to me after all?

501
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,940
This sinister picture is...

502
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,070
Oh my! It is so beautiful.

503
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,800
Court Lady Chun, you'd live even if you were poisoned.

504
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,970
Since you can't read the room.

505
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,470
Your compliment is so sudden!

506
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:21,070
Your Majesty, I offer you my greetings. I'm Sim-ong of the Han family.

507
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,430
Didn't we meet elsewhere?

508
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,660
I'm frightened!

509
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,850
I'm sorry... No, no.  Forgive me.

510
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,390
Instead, would you like to tell me something else?

511
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:46,000
For example, "I deserve to die."

512
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,830
Thanks to you, I flew all of the popcorn that I worked so hard to make.

513
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,620
I literally flew them in the sky.

514
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,530
I didn’t know you were the queen, I really didn't know.

515
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:03,590
That’s... why I committed such an offense.

516
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,210
Oh, you didn't know I was the queen!

517
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:13,340
- Then, why did you run away? 
 - Oh, well. I did it because such an invaluable person was chasing me.

518
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,710
I was surprised. That’s why I did it, there’s no other reason.

519
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,580
Okay.

520
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,360
In fact, Mr. Han,

521
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,570
- I summoned you to give you a seat in the government. 
 - Eh?

522
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:39,310
It's a good position. You’ll have that position for your whole life and don't worry, you won't ever be fired. You’ll be well paid, too.

523
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,220
- But in return, there’s something you’ll have to lose. 
 - Pardon me?

524
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,800
What am I going to lose?

525
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,830
Although we had a very brief meeting, I could see that your physiognomy is perfect for this position.

526
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm grateful, Your Majesty!

527
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,820
So... be my eunuch.

528
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,400
What!

529
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,440
Wait a second. Stop. One second.

530
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:15,380
Your Majesty, please withdraw your decision. Your grace is immeasurable.

531
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,970
Wait, but why are you doing this to me?

532
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,350
First, for pretending to be a noble with fake identification.

533
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,010
No... this isn't your fault. We should blame society for discriminating against those who aren't nobles.

534
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,780
You're correct!

535
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:37,390
Again... First, for pouring poisonous herbs into the water in the royal kitchen and ruining the king's banquet.

536
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,760
Second, for having a bad descendant.

537
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,450
D-Descendant...  Maybe you spoke wrong, didn't you mean my ancestors?

538
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,430
No. I'm sure.

539
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,660
You have a bad descendant.

540
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,070
But a d-descendant is...

541
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,860
Y-Your Majesty! Your Majesty, if I become a eunuch, I can't even have any descendants.

542
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,350
I can't have any descendants.  Hey, eunuch, do you have any descendants? No, right?

543
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,130
I'm telling you, I won't be able to have any descendants!

544
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,430
 Your Majesty! 

545
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,570
Your Majesty, the Lord Minister of the Military came.

546
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,550
Your Majesty.

547
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,970
 Ansong Kim family.  He's definitely in the same conspiracy with all of them.  

548
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,210
 But my father is also a member of the Ansong Kim family. Wait, I just said "my father" too naturally.  

549
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,480
Emotional transference is too serious here.

550
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,580
I belatedly figured out what happened to you after I had had an audience with you.

551
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,630
I didn't know you had gone through such a big incident...

552
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,060
So, you're saying you had no idea that they were trying to kill me?

553
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,950
I'm neither my father's person nor the Kim family's person.

554
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,420
 However, you can be free from neither of them.  

555
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,980
You will come to know that in the end.

556
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,380
Is he my enemy or my ally...

557
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,880
God...

558
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,610
Damn it!

559
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:54,400
Even so, how could they... to my queen?

560
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,460
Kim Jwa-geun, that bastard!  Immediately, I will—

561
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,080
On top of that, The Office of Correction for Three Taxes?

562
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,870
In the end, that is also a scheme to use the corruption of local government officials as an excuse

563
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,610
and bring our family down, I presume.

564
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,570
Please do not be concerned.

565
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,150
If he tries to call it exploitation and tries to find fault in it,

566
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,950
no one will be free from accusation.

567
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:29,150
Even if it's only for protecting themselves, all of them have no choice but to protect those local government officials, too.

568
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,660
So, The Office of Correction for Three Taxes will end up as an empty shell.

569
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,410
Even if we momentarily join our hands with them, don't even blink your eyes in front of Queen Dowager Jo.

570
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,860
With her smiling face, she's always harboring a knife behind her back.

571
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,200
I'll keep that in mind.

572
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,780
- Court Lady Chun. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

573
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,430
Take the table out and call Nurse Park.

574
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,010
Yes, Your Highness.

575
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,330
Have you already finished your meal, Your Highness?

576
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:07,080
I don't have any appetite.

577
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,980
I heard that you've been quite satisfied with the royal table, prepared by the queen so far.

578
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,390
It wasn't that great, but good enough for me to eat.

579
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,910
The queen is very heartbroken.

580
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,600
She said, because of Eui Bin's trick, she had misunderstood that our clan had turned its back to her.

581
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,120
She was blaming herself very much.

582
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,360
- Eui Bin? 
 - I also heard it from the queen's father today.

583
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,880
The person who deceived Your Highness wasn't the queen, but Eui Bin.

584
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,630
 His Majesty the King is here. 

585
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,940
Escort him in.

586
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,170
- Your Majesty. 
 - I'm sorry for barging in without notice at this late hour.

587
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,840
No, it's all right.  I'm grateful for your visit any time.

588
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,880
I came here as I have something to let you know, My Lady.

589
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,080
What is it, Your Majesty?

590
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,880
It's about the palace maid's corpse found in the well a while ago.

591
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,100
Queen Dowager ordered her people to stage the corpse that way.

592
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,410
Her Highness the Queen Dowager did?  But why...

593
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,140
Do you also not have any clue about why she did so?

594
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,490
Then, that corpse was...

595
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,010
I guess it was probably not Oh-wol.

596
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,780
That's not possible. That was definitely Oh-wol.

597
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,640
I was told that the corpse's face was unrecognizable, but why are you so certain that it was Oh-wol?

598
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,700
She was wearing a palace maid's uniform too,

599
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,540
and... the only missing palace maid was Oh-wol.

600
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,400
So, she must have known that you would be certain it was Oh-wol.

601
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:07,250
What Queen Dowager wants is probably your dependency on her.

602
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,340
But why was it in the well, of all places?

603
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,970
I told her about what we had experienced in a well.

604
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:21,940
Because, to me, a well is a place where I had met Your Majesty for the first time, but also a place that gave me heartache.

605
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,110
It was overlapped with the image of Your Majesty, so I was certain that I had lost the person dear to me.

606
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:34,350
I see now that here in the palace is where I shouldn't even share my painful memories recklessly.

607
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,950
 Please drag the queen down to the nightmares where I'm living.  

608
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,800
Going forward, you must never trust Queen Dowager.

609
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,650
Since we should hide the source of this information, please don't even show that you already know what Queen Dowager did.

610
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,810
I've also felt a huge disappointment and betrayal about Queen Dowager.

611
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:24,010
The well is a place layered with the fear of death,

612
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,590
but I've never thought she would use that...

613
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,440
   
  (Queen's quarters) 

614
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,700
So, this is similar to poker or hwa-tu.  (Flower Card Game) 

615
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,870
Indeed, for wasting time and life, gambling and games

616
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,800
are the best.

617
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,500
That's a relief, Your Majesty.

618
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
We thought that you might still be having a hard time because of Dam-hyan—

619
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,930
I apologize, Your Majesty.

620
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,850
Don't worry. Dam-hyang is in a better place now.

621
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,850
Yes, you're right. She's probably in a better place now, right?

622
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,860
Dam-hyang...

623
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:12,520
No, no, I mean she's really in a better place now.

624
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,720
Dam-hyang!

626
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,520
She's really in a better place!

627
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,430
Why do you keep crying?

628
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,010
I apologize.

629
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:35,110
Come to think of it, I wasn't able to say goodbye to Dam-hyang.

630
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,110
Dam-hyang...

631
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,150
Your Majesty.

632
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,470
Dam-hyang...

633
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,380
Seven.

634
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,450
Eight.

635
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,860
This is what they would call

636
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,980
nine.

637
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,310
I apologize.

638
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,850
Dammit.

639
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,770
Dam-hyang...

640
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,870
All in.

641
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,770
How do you think Queen Dowager Jo got her hands on the ledger?

642
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,780
We couldn't even find it after going around looking for it.

643
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:29,160
Looking at this, isn't it better for us to recruit Queen Dowager Jo for our team?

644
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,150
It's a joke.

645
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,680
Since she's better at this work than me, who can freely walk around outside of the palace, I feel a bit ashamed.

646
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,630
But Queen Dowager Jo is always cooped up in Seonwonjeon Hall, how did she get her hands on the ledger?

647
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,970
Seeing how she manipulated the corpse,

648
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,660
it's possible she has access to people who act as her hands and feet.

649
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,790
Then, should we recruit those hands and feet...

650
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,910
Is the composite of the man with the goblin mask not done yet?

651
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,680
Lately, I've been struggling with too much work.

652
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,160
You know like freeing Dam-hyang's mother from slavery and finding her missing father, too.

653
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,800
But you couldn't find Dam-hyang's father, though.

654
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,480
How am I supposed to find people hiding in the mountains?

655
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,380
He must have become a bandit.

656
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,840
These days, with the thought of a vacation that I will get after the business trip as a royal inspector,

657
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,390
I am barely... barely, barely, barely holding.

658
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,090
My friend, what I meant by a vacation was—

659
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,970
But, if possible, why don't you make me a secret royal inspector, instead of a royal inspector?

660
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,530
They have a better style.

661
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:37,090
First, hiding my identity and then, "Ta-Da" pulling out the mapae!  (T/N: mapae - Badge of the Royal Inspector.) 

662
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:41,050
You're a natural-born secret royal inspector.  Go ahead with it.

663
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,110
-  Do it one more time. 
 - Ta-da!

664
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,970
I really didn't see my father like that.

665
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,990
People like Kim Jwa-geun deserve to die, but him—

666
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,750
He's the only family I have left.

667
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,920
You were out to kill your father-in-law and wife, how can you sleep at night?

668
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,110
You aren't.

669
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,860
Don't act up, heart.

670
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,450
It's hurting my pride.

671
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,050
 She was in the water for such a long time. 

672
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,200
 How suffocating and painful it must have been. 

673
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,060
 The body in the well was either a horrifying coincidence 

674
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,120
 or someone's way of pitting us against each other.  

675
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,990
I was caught up in my thoughts.

676
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,800
The shock must have been big.

677
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,810
This palace is too big for me.

678
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,840
Not only is it lonely, but it's easy to lose your way.

679
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,310
I've found a palace maid who sold the accessory that you gave to Oh-wol.

680
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,960
She said she had just found it buried underground in the palace.

681
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,830
Is that so?

682
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,480
Per Queen Dowager Jo's orders, the one who put the body in the well was also her.

683
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,390
Oh-wol is alive.

684
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,170
She must have suffered some misfortune inside the palace.

685
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,760
She wasn't able to even step foot outside this palace.

686
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,120
Shouldn't you hope that the corpse in the well isn't Oh-wol?

687
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,840
Shouldn't you be happy that the corpse in the well isn't Oh-wol?

688
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,520
Why is it that you want to believe that corpse is Oh-wol? What exactly...

689
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,520
What are you hiding?

690
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,770
Last time,

691
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:43,950
when you handed an object over to Queen Dowager Jo. What was it?

692
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,960
You saw?

693
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:03,600
If My Lady tells me I didn't see anything, then I did not see it.

694
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,660
Anyone can lose their way momentarily.

695
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,760
You can still come back to your original position.

696
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,470
What if isn't momentary?

697
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:23,960
Will I still be able to return to where I was?

698
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,430
I can't go back now.

699
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,640
My Lady.

700
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,330
That corpse has to be Oh-wol!

701
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,000
Why are you making Samyang ramen this late at night?

702
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:56,500
Why do people crave ramen at night? It's obvious you'll be bloated the next morning.

703
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,700
It's hard to endure this temptation despite knowing that fact.

704
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,760
You've worked hard to make it, but what a shame.

705
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,640
Her Highness the Grand Queen Dowager has never eaten anything at this late hour.

706
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,330
I will try some instead.

707
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,650
No.

708
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,920
If you're here you should say something.

709
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,560
Why are you tapping the door and standing there?

710
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,290
Do you want... to eat ramen before you go? 
  (T/N: This is an expression equivalent to 'Netflix and chill?' Have sex.)  

711
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,460
What is ramen and where am I supposed to go after eating it?

712
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,710
No strings attached. Shall I say, it's a sort of research?

713
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,860
Or a test?

714
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,020
No. I shouldn't be like this.

715
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,490
But just one spoonful.

716
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:20,010
No, no. This ramen is an addicting food.

717
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,530
Once you have a bite you can't stop.

718
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,750
What are you doing?

719
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,590
Inner conflict.

720
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,260
If you were me, what would you do?

721
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,420
Would you eat the ramen or not?

722
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,100
Please explain first what ramen is—

723
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,150
- First, 
 - First?

724
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,930
let's have some.

725
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,490
Right?  Whatever it is, you should experience it first to know about it.

726
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,670
Whether it was because I was drunk

727
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,260
or I've really gone crazy. Or if neither is right, then maybe because this is really

728
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,520
the right thing for me.

729
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,690
Are we talking about the same thing?

730
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:14,110
Of course. We're talking about ramen.

731
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,160
Come closer. Ramen tastes the best when it's hot.
    

732
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,260
My gosh.

733
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,830
What are you doing!

734
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:26,480
Oh no, this precious thing.

735
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,650
Do you know what this is that you consider it precious?

736
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:50,700
Why is this children's book precious to you?

737
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,790
That—

738
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,990
Is it you, My Queen?

739
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:02,060
Are you the one who saved me?

740
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,240
Were you the one who saved me from the well?

741
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,450
That's right. It was me.

742
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:31,870


743
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,530
   

744
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:43,990
♫  You know, I want to embrace you in my arms fully  ♫

745
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,890
♫  Whenever you breathe softly  ♫

746
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:54,160
♫  But it's fine even if I can't do that  ♫

747
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:59,030
♫  You're the reason why I want to dream  ♫

748
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,990
 My Cheoljong must be waiting endlessly for me to come.  

749
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,920
 Did you just set up a trap? 

750
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,990
 Who knew that the queen's declaration of war was really true...?  

751
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:07,840
 Is it my turn? 

752
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,610
 Please unsheathe the sword. 

753
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:13,400
 If any of us don't clean it up properly and are found at fault, that person will take all the blame by himself.  

754
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,520
 Even if we slash the Kim family, Kim Byeong-in's power is getting stronger.  

755
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,500
 It feels like marking time somehow. 

756
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,630
 If Cheoljong succeeds, I guess the world of 200 years later will change, too. Right? 

757
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,670
 As I'm on your side now, you're destined to win. 

758
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:27,160
 Because I have a secret weapon.  I know about the future.  

759
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,680
♫  Just look at me, not knowing how I feel  ♫
