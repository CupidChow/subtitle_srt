None of this has anything to do with history.)

(Episode 5)

Everyone has their own fatal weakness
(Episode 5)

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,830
Everyone has their own fatal weakness

5
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,600
Even the superman who is the only one

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,890
In the face of green radiation

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,190
It's just a matter of having to put on underwear

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,250
Wear it outside and it's decadent and perverted

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,210
Superman is like this

10
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,160
What's more, he is just an ordinary person.

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm willing to confess everything

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,050
I am willing to obey the orders of the Queen Mother.

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,700
The person who really deserves to be beheaded is not Yipin

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,220
Your Highness

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Please

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,060
Do you still want to disobey the imperial order?

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,930
For ordinary people

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
This World

19
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,060
It's like a minefield of weaknesses.

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,750
We will become each other's weakness

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,980
Drag everyone to hell

22
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,051
Even I, Jang Bong-hwan, who is close to perfection, have weaknesses.

23
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,211
That's exactly...

24
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,591
I can't see the other guy.

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,251
More handsome than me

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,720
The forces that want to harm the Central Temple...

27
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,610
Wait a moment

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,540
Especially in front of the woman you like.

29
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,890
I must be the most handsome to be happy

30
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,910
I can say that I have always been the most handsome

31
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,810
A man who has never lost to anyone in terms of handsomeness

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,540
The only weakness

33
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,160
Or let the concubine at the center of the case

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,310
Let's reveal the truth

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,000
Concubine

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,340
I wanted to commit suicide.

37
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,540
Do you think I'll let you dress up alone?

38
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,540
Get away from me, Cheoljong

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,810
I am the hero here.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,120
therefore

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,510
Please don't let innocent people bleed.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,040
So cool

43
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,660
What are you talking about now?

44
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,790
Your Majesty, please forgive me for my fear.

45
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,020
I really want to commit suicide

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,070
This is

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,540
The suicide note I always carry with me

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm going back today anyway.

49
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,460
What happens here is none of my business.

50
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,170
Why the middle temple?

51
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,700
And it was the night before he became the nave.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,930
Want to commit suicide?

53
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,680
Well, that's because...

54
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,690
What is the reason?

55
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,400
The reason why I am so depressed that I would rather die than live

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,600
It definitely exists

57
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,720
Yipin

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,250
hateful

59
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,850
MILF

60
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,850
Shao Rong

61
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,390
Is he going to hug me now?

62
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,290
Don't

63
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,500
Hey, don't come over here.

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,860
The King and the Concubine

65
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,720
The Queen Mother is now

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,780
Even lying to save his men

67
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,350
Please praise her.

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,180
Even the traitor who wanted to harm me

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,030
The noble heart that wants to tolerate

70
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,480
Let's go easy on him

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Hmm, that's a good explanation.

72
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,430
Is there anything exciting to see?

73
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,470
So many people gathered here

74
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,410
she...

75
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,070
she...

76
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,250
Empress of the Middle Temple

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,240
No, this is...

78
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,040
What's going on

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
All right

80
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,280
The Central Palace has taken so much trouble

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,240
Look at her efforts

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,010
It's okay for me to be kind.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,010
(Episode 5: Easily injured heels)

84
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,370
It's rare to have such interesting and lively things to watch

85
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,520
What on earth was the middle temple thinking?

86
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,710
Is it a woman's heart?

87
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,270
Anyway, this was definitely not the Jin family's idea.

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,100
yes

89
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,900
Are you going to the Former King's Palace?

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,120
Today, I prayed

91
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,240
Something else needs to be done

92
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,550
Although she is just a weak concubine

93
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,250
But she's our only weapon.

94
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,820
We can only be at the tip of her arrow

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,420
Apply more poison

96
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,770
Suicide

97
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,680
How could you kill yourself?

98
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,750
Find a time to wake up

99
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,090
Dad doesn't even know you want to commit suicide

100
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,240
I am a sinner

101
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,690
I am the sinner

102
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,430
It's a small mistake

103
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,240
The younger one should take good care of her.

104
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,190
They are all small shortcomings

105
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,720
Why

106
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,010
You have always been with her, so you should know the situation.

107
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,710
There were times when she saw water and wanted to rush in.

108
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,410
I thought it was just because of the impact of falling into the water.

109
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
The sequelae caused

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,100
There were several times

111
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,910
How much pain are you in?

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
Niangniang

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,480
Niangniang

114
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,230
Stop crying

115
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,450
How can I wake up like this?

116
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,880
us

117
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,320
We can't cry now.

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,060
If she saw us cry

119
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,280
How sad will she be?

120
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,450
That's right

121
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,100
The more this time

122
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,310
The more we have to be together, the stronger we will be.

123
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,350
Then I can wake up, right?

124
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,330
Shao Rong

125
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,420
Really

126
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,470
After your mother gave birth to you

127
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,230
Then he passed away

128
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Has it started again?

129
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,150
Niangniang

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,140
Lian Niang

131
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,830
I haven't even seen my mother's face.

132
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,420
Poor lady

133
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,680
I don't even know how much pain you are in.

134
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,120
I just know to stop you from doing this or that.

135
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,060
I nag you every day

136
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,300
Small is equal to

137
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,330
I pushed you into the lake with my own hands.

138
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,170
Oh my god

139
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,450
Niangniang

140
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,320
Give up

141
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,860
This is not a scene I can handle.

142
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,740
Empress of the Middle Temple

143
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,540
Please also be sure to

144
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,270
Take care of yourself

145
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,350
All for the father

146
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,280
Sorry for you

147
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,980
Brother

148
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm going to the palace today.

149
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,560
Today is finally my first time

150
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
The day I saw His Majesty

151
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,980
Are you so happy?

152
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,900
Isn't it because of curiosity?

153
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,670
Sometimes it's an unlearned young man.

154
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,000
Sometimes it is a young man with light behind him.

155
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,650
I mean in a dream

156
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
He even became like a brother last night

157
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,500
I thought I gave up on you

158
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,030
To make you happy

159
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,640
You were so happy before entering the palace

160
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,420
After entering the palace, he gave up his life

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Maybe it's because of that

162
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,820
She must be crazy

163
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,230
She's definitely not normal.

164
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
In the palace for several days and nights

165
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,880
She did not win over the Lord

166
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,070
Instead, I was won over by my master.

167
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,510
Please calm down, ma'am.

168
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,640
There is no benefit from anger

169
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,850
How can I not be angry now?

170
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,230
Such a great opportunity

171
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,620
She wasted it all.

172
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,810
How could she ruin her own good fortune?

173
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,490
And did you see the attitude of the Lord just now?

174
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,210
The wanton look

175
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,850
I saved his life.

176
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,660
He was even made king.

177
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,930
How dare he look at me like that?

178
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,680
He despises you, so you should teach him a lesson

179
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,260
We have to strangle his breath little by little

180
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,740
Let him be self-aware

181
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,640
What's the point of bothering with management?

182
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,360
A night of worry will only make everything go to waste

183
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,710
Call the doctor Park

184
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,940
yes

185
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,170
Frankly speaking

186
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,000
The middle temple came to see me

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,250
The night she fell into the water

188
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,170
The King and the Concubine

189
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,600
Little girl...

190
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,700
Want to leave the palace

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,890
What is that?

192
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,680
My daughter can't bear the queen's presence

193
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,790
The little girl doesn't want to live in misery

194
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,590
No wonder there are rumors in the palace that you have bad morals.

195
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,310
It was intentional.

196
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,090
You don't want to sit in the middle hall

197
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,480
So cute

198
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,240
I thought everything would go as I wished.

199
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,550
I was taking the Middle Temple course so seriously before.

200
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,810
Now, she suddenly changed her gender

201
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,330
I don't know and I don't want to know

202
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,390
Your destiny is determined since birth.

203
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,260
Becoming the High Priest consolidates my family's position

204
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,110
This is your destiny

205
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,620
It's also the reason for your existence

206
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,770
Did you come here by yourself?

207
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,980
no

208
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,300
So you can’t go on your own.

209
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,350
I'd rather die in the palace.

210
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,780
Kids these days are too spoiled.

211
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,370
The Middle Temple course suffered a bit

212
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,130
I had a weak thought

213
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,090
I didn't take it seriously.

214
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,080
She fell into the water

215
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,480
I never dreamed that I would commit suicide

216
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,930
If she was even at the cost of her life

217
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,420
If you don't want to be a middle temple

218
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,920
Today's crazy move is also...

219
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,010
I want to come down from the middle hall.

220
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,180
If this is true

221
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,820
I will never let go of the central temple

222
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,860
Let's go together

223
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,860
What if you fall?

224
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,510
I told you to slow down.

225
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,830
Who dares to block the jade body

226
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,610
The King and the Concubine

227
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,490
You can't go back to the middle hall.

228
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm destined to be the palace, Zhang Fenghuan

229
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,920
Until the body rots here

230
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,810
Will be here forever

231
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,620
Live as a miserable eunuch

232
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,390
don't want

233
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,350
don't want

234
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,600
I don't want to be a eunuch

235
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,030
Niangniang

236
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,550
This dream is really

237
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,000
You just said you committed suicide.

238
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,620
Then he fainted again

239
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm really worried...

240
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,120
Calm down

241
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,630
I understand your feelings

242
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,160
Then I'll follow you.

243
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,230
Stop crying

244
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,560
Today's tears

245
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,560
This is more than I can handle in one day.

246
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,570
This isn't an infectious disease.

247
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,540
Why do you keep crying?

248
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,450
Otherwise, how could I fall asleep while waiting?

249
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,360
That's right

250
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,840
You don't want to see the little one cry, right?

251
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,970
You are beautiful even when you cry

252
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,200
Where is Choi Sang-Gong?

253
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,370
She insisted on getting the medicine herself

254
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,070
By the way, Fuyuanjun has always been by your side.

255
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,240
Don't go back until sunset

256
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,560
If you wake up a little earlier

257
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,500
I can still see him

258
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,130
Great, didn't see it.

259
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,500
What

260
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,310
If he could see his precious daughter

261
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,690
The soul of a black-hearted man has entered my body

262
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,650
How sad will he be?

263
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,690
Go quickly while Choi Sang-Gong is not here.

264
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,930
The lake should be full of water now.

265
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,450
Are you going to the lake so late?

266
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,940
The day has finally arrived

267
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,400
Are you in a good mood?

268
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,850
Of course

269
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,970
Now I just need to leave the aftertaste of a handsome man

270
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,850
Turned back home

271
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,690
That's right

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,540
red lotus

273
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,860
It's the queen

274
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,090
It's because of you that I can hold on.

275
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,750
I can't guarantee for others

276
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,420
But I will definitely miss you

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,850
Oh, and Choi Sang-Gong

278
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,940
When you die, Honglian

279
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,260
You must leave a last word to your descendants.

280
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,340
Last words?

281
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,720
Go to Jiangnan to buy land

282
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,460
This sentence must be said

283
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,100
Buy it and keep it in your hands for a hundred years

284
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,220
Your offspring will then be able to live a good life.

285
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,940
This is the only tip I can give you.

286
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay, let's go.

287
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,390
My lady, be careful.

288
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,450
So tired. So tired.

289
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,660
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

290
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,270
Huh

291
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,010
What's going on?

292
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,750
I have designed such good things for you.

293
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,250
Why do we still move it manually?

294
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,490
That's because

295
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,870
The wells are all dry.

296
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,700
So we will go from there

297
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,570
Keep bringing water

298
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,840
Could you please say it again?

299
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,640
I think I heard wrongly.

300
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,160
How do you say it like

301
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,990
The lake cannot be filled tonight.

302
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,390
Damn little lady

303
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,030
Damn little lady

304
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,790
As a senior civil servant

305
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,530
How can you contradict what you said?

306
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,830
You clearly said you could fill it up today.

307
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,030
Even the nearest well

308
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,630
It takes two or three days to go back and forth

309
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,330
So it will take at least another half month...

310
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,740
Damn the little one

311
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,280
Damn little lady

312
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,400
Damn little lady

313
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,450
Damn

314
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,430
Why do people here always say they deserve to die?

315
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,710
Do you think I won't really kill you?

316
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,590
That's it.

317
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,920
Want me to show you what it means to walk the talk?

318
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,000
Want to give you an image of no empty promises?

319
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,280
OK

320
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,040
It doesn't matter.

321
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,170
No, my lady.

322
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,730
Why is it that even you are like this?

323
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,370
I won't let my empress commit suicide again.

324
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,970
It's not like that

325
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,870
I'm not going to commit suicide

326
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,150
So what are you going to do?

327
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,080
That is...

328
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,370
It's to survive

329
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,150
Only this way can I survive

330
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,670
Don't want to leave

331
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,130
How can this force be so great?

332
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,290
Let me go

333
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,260
If the old woman orders people to drain the lake again

334
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,330
I'm totally done playing.

335
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,980
Come and stop the lady!

336
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,520
How dare we...

337
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,790
Niangniang

338
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,770
No, my lady.

339
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,640
I won't nag you anymore.

340
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,200
I won't stop you anymore.

341
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,140
So you must not do that, my lady.

342
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,540
Still saying no?

343
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,430
Didn't you say you wouldn't stop me?

344
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,700
Damn

345
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,900
This can't be done.

346
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,510
anyway

347
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,790
Losing smile

348
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,070
It's been a long time

349
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,160
Damn

350
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,130
No more. No more. No more.

351
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,010
Oh damn

352
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,360
It's OK as long as I don't go.

353
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,220
knew

354
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,460
Lift your head

355
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,660
Stand up straight

356
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,260
Can you swim

357
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,320
Can I just walk there?

358
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,940
If you go further, the water is deeper.

359
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,060
Yeah, then go and have a look.

360
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,730
That's right

361
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,400
I just slipped.

362
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,980
Damn

363
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,930
Niangniang

364
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,760
The Queen Mother wants you to come over immediately.

365
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,780
Damn

366
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,130
The name Li Shengfang is a source of trouble.

367
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,330
Damn

368
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,230
Take a sip

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,760
oops

370
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,100
What's wrong

371
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,180
Do you feel this way sometimes?

372
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,230
Except myself

373
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,200
The world has changed so much

374
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,050
The center of the world is you, young master.

375
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,940
People who are particularly sensitive

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,380
Sometimes I talk nonsense

377
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,780
I don't want cold noodles.

378
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,100
This is for the old customers who come here every day

379
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,320
My sincerity

380
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,300
Let me tell you something

381
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,040
I come here every day to play.

382
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,360
But it’s not

383
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,600
This is just to find a

384
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,900
Just a person named Li Shenglu

385
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,200
But that young master

386
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,900
Why is it so hard to find?

387
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,670
I think

388
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,550
There is a very big secret about his whereabouts

389
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,540
My keen sense tells me

390
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,400
Li Shengli

391
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,470
This is the key to the whole case.

392
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,570
What case?

393
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,690
I don't know

394
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,470
What

395
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,060
I am facing an exam now.

396
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,050
Today's things

397
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,110
What happened today is all my fault

398
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,220
Forcing you to accept this position in the nave

399
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,820
It's my mistake

400
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,050
Is the position of the nave really that unpleasant?

401
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,950
Risk your life

402
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,870
Is it okay even if it is abolished?

403
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,530
Did you commit suicide because you didn't want to become a high priest?

404
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,540
good

405
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,180
Since you think so

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Then I'll let you leave the palace.

407
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,080
ruined nave

408
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,560
To be locked up in a private house for life

409
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,470
End this life

410
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,450
no

411
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,750
Only through the lake here

412
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,970
I can go home

413
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,690
I

414
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,730
Can't remember

415
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,940
Ever since I fell into the lake

416
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,680
The memory has not yet fully recovered

417
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,720
I can't remember

418
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,400
But you still remember that you wanted to commit suicide

419
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,910
All that's left is the painful feeling

420
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,660
I also wrote the suicide note myself.

421
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,240
I can't remember why I committed suicide.

422
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,400
Since the memory is incomplete

423
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
So why did you stand up?

424
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,810
If there is no reason

425
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,770
Probably just want to fight me.

426
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,670
No

427
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,460
I don't want to go against the Queen Mother.

428
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,820
Today, the Central Temple has officially challenged me.

429
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,950
I have to get over this situation.

430
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,900
But there is no way. There is no way.

431
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,180
I can never forgive you for this.

432
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,210
Please give me death

433
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,070
I'm damned

434
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,480
Because of incomplete memory

435
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,970
I feel confused myself.

436
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,400
I can't abandon my family and my husband.

437
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,940
Let me end this pain

438
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,400
Please give me a bowl of poison.

439
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,780
What they really want is not to be deposed.

440
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Is your life so worthless?

441
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,240
Throw yourself into the lake

442
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,800
Now I want to give you a bowl of poison

443
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,210
Why are you so cowardly?

444
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,460
What they want

445
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,480
It is to clearly rank people by seniority.

446
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,550
It was my stupid choice to commit suicide.

447
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,210
The misunderstanding

448
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,970
Damn it, my son

449
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,770
So please grant me death, my lady.

450
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,130
You think this matter

451
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,480
Can the death of the middle temple end it?

452
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,280
Because of this matter

453
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,850
The Queen Mother Zhao had a big handle on her.

454
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,900
This is not your weakness, Middle Temple.

455
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,940
They will take this as

456
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,840
The weakness of our Kim family

457
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,960
I will definitely do this

458
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,870
Calm down, both of you.

459
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,640
One last time, let me ask the Queen Mother

460
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,590
Do you really want to leave the palace?

461
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,830
I want to live in the palace

462
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,070
How is the Queen Dowager?

463
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,440
No memory is like rebirth

464
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,500
I want to be reborn as the perfect nave

465
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,360
I don't believe it's just a verbal agreement.

466
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,160
I will take action

467
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,920
Watch it, Queen Dowager

468
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,890
All right

469
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,590
Holy Grace

470
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,460
I won't let you worry anymore

471
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,630
I'm not worried

472
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,090
Because I have no weaknesses

473
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,440
If it becomes a problem

474
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,170
Just pick it out.

475
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,770
This is serious.

476
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,610
It's a real warning

477
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,980
The future is bleak indeed.

478
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,600
Can you please turn on the light a little more, my lady?

479
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,020
No

480
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,550
I mean my future.

481
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,880
Yongping Jun came in with his warriors

482
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,670
Samurai?

483
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,980
Is he a soldier from the Guards?

484
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,550
Someone who has received special training

485
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,700
How many people?

486
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,540
not much

487
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,660
Seven people

488
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,040
People who hide and prepare to deal with

489
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,830
There are only seven warriors?

490
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,110
Not enough medicine

491
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,820
If I didn't have that disease

492
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,100
He might become the most powerful warrior.

493
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,990
I rely on adults to keep me alive

494
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,960
I am very grateful

495
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,940
Whatever the reason

496
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,690
If I fail again next time

497
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
I won't give you this medicine again.

498
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,390
I will keep it in mind

499
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,130
So far we think

500
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,090
The Queen Mother jumped into the lake to frame Concubine Yi

501
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,460
There are some hidden reasons for amnesia

502
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,080
False things

503
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,750
Want to commit suicide

504
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,980
It is possible that all this is to confuse His Highness.

505
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,740
You mean she anticipated it?

506
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,580
Did I stand up for Concubine Yi?

507
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,580
If His Highness had not stepped forward

508
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,280
You can frame the queen

509
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,860
If you show up

510
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,870
I can win back your heart, Your Highness.

511
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,120
Yongping Jun has always believed

512
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,520
What the Temple Did

513
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,570
There is hidden malice

514
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,720
nave

515
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,230
The core of the Kim family

516
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,090
What kind of people are the Kim family?

517
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,510
The one who framed our family.

518
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,490
I can't forget it for a moment

519
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,700
This fact

520
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,030
I can't forget

521
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
But look at the choices made by the Middle Temple today.

522
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,740
For the me who wanted to kill myself

523
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,920
Yipin, who always maintains opposition

524
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,040
Tell the truth for these two people

525
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:48,750
In this case

526
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,940
We had always believed

527
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,620
Hostility to the Nave

528
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,850
Is that true?

529
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,450
Your Highness

530
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
If the Queen really wanted to commit suicide

531
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,630
I killed the middle temple twice in a row.

532
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,560
Why is the Central Palace here?

533
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,240
I have something to tell you

534
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,770
You're making things more complicated.

535
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,920
Anyway, I am in your family's hands.

536
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,790
Next time, just tell me directly

537
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,570
Ask me to hand over the letter.

538
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,200
Your Highness, it's because I am Anseong Jin

539
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,960
Do you hate me?

540
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,500
I never said I hate you

541
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,500
So do you like me?

542
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,700
If I wasn't from the Ancheng Jin family

543
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,570
Can you look at me differently?

544
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,010
impossible

545
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:10,940
Because you are from the Kim family

546
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,830
I just took this position in the middle hall.

547
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,000
I also work very hard

548
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,810
Not just because of my last name.

549
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,190
Just took this position

550
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,260
I worked hard to get this position

551
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,240
Whatever

552
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,710
You can sit on it tomorrow.

553
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,990
The position you've always dreamed of.

554
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,330
It's late at night and I'm facing something important

555
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,080
Please go back to bed.

556
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,300
You have to admire me

557
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,280
Are you ordering me?

558
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,650
My indifference

559
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,450
Pushed the nave into the lake

560
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,590
Just in case

561
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,460
Because of His Highness's indifference

562
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,880
If you choose to commit suicide

563
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,680
A person will fall into the lake

564
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,710
But forging letters

565
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,450
Jump into the lake in front of Concubine Yi

566
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,720
I think there are other intentions

567
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,930
Intent?

568
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,210
I have to see the nave.

569
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,970
The villain came with a smile on his face.

570
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,650
If it's to win back my heart

571
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,770
If you do that

572
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,770
You can tell from the attitude of the middle temple.

573
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,720
Brother, please take care of Concubine Yi here.

574
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,330
I have half a month to cosplay the perfect nave

575
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,390
Can I hold on till then?

576
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,610
It is very likely that in this boring Joseon era

577
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,010
Inside the body of a bored woman

578
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,610
Under the name of the boring deposed prime minister

579
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,370
A lifetime of imprisonment

580
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,440
well

581
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,040
Who can I blame if I hurt myself?

582
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,760
Niangniang

583
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,570
His Majesty has arrived

584
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,650
Who can I blame? I have to blame that kid Cheoljong.

585
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,110
Yeah, if he didn't show up.

586
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,310
Can I show up myself?

587
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,490
Open it

588
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,820
If only that guy wasn't so incompetent

589
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,330
Do I need to do that?

590
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,860
If he had done it before then

591
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,140
Can that woman commit suicide?

592
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,820
Before that

593
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,660
nave

594
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,380
How is your body?

595
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,800
The person who is so worried about my health

596
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,200
He actually held a knife to me.

597
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,620
Since I came here

598
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,490
There is no day that goes smoothly

599
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,290
Tell me when you open your eyes

600
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,610
Tomorrow is the day of the ceremony

601
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
A quilt is covered under a roof

602
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,300
Her husband

603
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,520
Want to kill me

604
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,830
I was on my side.

605
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,650
My Family

606
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,980
He threatened me with dethronement

607
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,910
Dethroned

608
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,750
What's wrong

609
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,610
Are you moved?

610
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,750
There is a great opportunity

611
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,730
Can let Zhao Huazhen sit

612
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,430
This is the middle hall, right?

613
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,680
Why are you as excited as a cockfight?

614
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,140
I'm not here to quarrel with the middle temple

615
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,170
I only see your face.

616
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,010
I feel angry

617
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,300
Can it be otherwise?

618
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,320
Want to kill me

619
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,060
You kid

620
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,490
And you love me to death

621
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,150
Your lover

622
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,400
I think I'm going to die for both of you.

623
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,620
This goes on until I kill myself.

624
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,030
To be killed by someone

625
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,450
If you don't get angry in this situation

626
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,870
Is this still a human?

627
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,980
That's Buddha.

628
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,840
Maybe you have a lot of resentment towards me.

629
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,650
I understand

630
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,560
No

631
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,150
Don't understand

632
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
Now let's talk about understanding

633
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,930
Don't say a word.

634
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,940
That understanding

635
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,870
You should have said it before you put the knife to my neck.

636
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,220
wrong

637
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,930
The day before the wedding ceremony with you

638
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,800
Want to commit suicide

639
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,520
This body

640
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,800
I should have understood it then.

641
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,470
Too late

642
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,360
Even if you understand now

643
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,620
Hey, go away.

644
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,190
Now I don't even have the energy to be angry.

645
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,630
I'll come back when you calm down.

646
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,870
Don't come over

647
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,910
If you hadn't kneeled down before me and begged for mercy

648
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,060
I will come again

649
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,520
This person is really

650
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,400
I told you not to come

651
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,180
Is this refilling the lake?

652
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,510
Empress of the Middle Temple

653
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,270
Requested the Queen Mother

654
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,230
Why

655
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,750
Don't know the reason

656
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,600
Today, the Queen Mother went to the lake.

657
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,850
I heard that he was in charge of the command himself.

658
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,110
Your Highness

659
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,440
Sorry to upset you.

660
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,930
I'm afraid of losing you

661
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,110
Is there any injury?

662
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,870
Compared to my pain

663
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,720
Your Highness's wound hurts more

664
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,750
All day today

665
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,350
It's too cruel for you, Huazhen.

666
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,630
sorry

667
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,350
Involving you in this storm

668
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,460
So far, I have been alone in this palace.

669
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,350
How lonely and uncomfortable it is

670
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,930
I didn't summon you to the palace to share my tragedy.

671
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,830
So don't do this anymore.

672
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,800
If you sacrificed yourself to save me

673
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,690
How can I stay sane?

674
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,190
I won't

675
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,070
Don't do anything that scares His Highness again.

676
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,540
Until the situation stabilizes

677
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,790
Yongping Jun will protect you personally

678
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,610
that

679
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,510
Red Moon?

680
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,270
Hong Biejian asks for an audience

681
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,310
Come in

682
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,700
How is my maidservant?

683
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,510
Sent to the internal hospital and is undergoing treatment

684
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,690
My brother put a lot of thought into it.

685
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,610
Thank you

686
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,620
Have you seen the central temple?

687
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,150
Um

688
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,230
How about it

689
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,650
Angry at me

690
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,550
What

691
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,430
Blame my indifference

692
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,830
Forced her to commit suicide

693
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,680
And to me who once tried to kill myself

694
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,180
Dislike for me

695
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,160
All the emotions burst out

696
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,620
Not to please me.

697
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,210
The actions that come out

698
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,190
Plus

699
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,740
She was also threatened with dethronement by the Jin family.

700
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,690
and

701
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,010
Kim Byung-in doesn't know yet

702
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,980
The owner of the robe is His Highness

703
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,330
really

704
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,150
The Central Palace remained silent.

705
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,810
Although I don't know the reason

706
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,920
It's true that the Nave acted alone.

707
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,990
I think according to the choice of the nave

708
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,110
Know what kind of person she is

709
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,190
It's even less clear

710
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,080
Father, I am Bingren

711
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,190
Come in

712
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,820
I thought you had given up smoking.

713
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,000
yes

714
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,210
I'm sorry about today.

715
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,380
What do you have to be sorry about?

716
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,020
What are your plans?

717
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,220
To make people understand

718
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,940
If you still don't understand

719
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,890
It has to be dealt with.

720
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,800
Who do you mean?

721
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,470
No matter who

722
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,040
Anyway, there are no permanent allies.

723
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,810
Now is not the right time to say this

724
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,920
But I have something to say

725
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,960
What is good?

726
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,640
finally

727
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,500
I decided my dream

728
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,350
Unexpected good news.

729
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,160
Which location is it?

730
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,190
I want to be the head of the Imperial Court

731
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,160
The head of the Yoshikinfu?

732
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,410
Just a warrior's position

733
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,040
Is this your dream?

734
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,680
From being able to use my body

735
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,220
Start from the position where you do things

736
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,260
To create dreams

737
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,930
yes

738
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,920
Rise up with your strength

739
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,740
The Empress Yipin has arrived

740
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,550
You can't move

741
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,860
Niangniang

742
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,720
sorry

743
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,320
I should have held on to the end

744
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,900
Your injured knee says it all

745
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,040
I know all

746
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,570
Not a big deal

747
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,350
If you apply the medicine for a few days

748
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,030
Maybe he can run away right away.

749
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,860
good

750
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,150
It will definitely be like this

751
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,200
Who is so cruel?

752
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,080
Even though I blocked my face, I couldn't see anything.

753
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,630
I only remember the sound

754
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,900
The Kindness

755
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,560
Although I'm sorry

756
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,050
If no one from the royal family was injured

757
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,320
Can't stay in the palace

758
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,530
But how can I leave the palace with this body?

759
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,900
This is the palace rule.

760
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,460
How can you be so cold and heartless?

761
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,960
If you are on your way out of the palace

762
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,750
If someone is causing trouble

763
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,030
Use this as a bribe

764
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,100
If you leave the palace safely

765
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,160
Use it as travel expenses to go back safely

766
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,790
No, it's so expensive.

767
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,850
I will send letters to my family.

768
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,560
Don't worry about anything

769
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,960
During this period

770
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,680
Thanks a lot

771
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,240
How can I face adults?

772
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,420
I can't go

773
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,660
Red Moon

774
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,150
I've lived with you all my life

775
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,810
You are my blood

776
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,270
Only you hold on

777
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,450
I can hold on.

778
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,240
Live stronger for me.

779
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,400
Just have to survive

780
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,880
This is my request

781
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,030
What's up?

782
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,550
There was a big fuss yesterday

783
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,740
The Queen Mother...

784
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,510
grown ups

785
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,060
Have you heard about that?

786
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,600
His Majesty,

787
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,790
To the Queen Mother

788
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,080
Like he was going to eat her.

789
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,230
Stare at her with eyes wide open

790
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,780
I said

791
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,610
I said

792
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,080
Your Highness

793
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,080
In front of the nave

794
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,740
Hold it up

795
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,980
Have you heard about that incident?

796
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,880
Your Highness holds the knife

797
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,020
To the Queen Mother...

798
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,250
Have you heard about what happened in Tongming Palace yesterday?

799
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,600
As skilled as eating

800
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,640
today

801
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,320
Appointment of the Governor of the Imperial Court

802
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,820
Appointment?

803
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,180
It's an appointment

804
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,090
Who is

805
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,220
The person proposed to be appointed as the head of the New Yijinfu

806
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,150
It's a man named Bingren from the Anseong Kim clan.

807
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,550
It's unexpected

808
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,230
There are many characters in the Yijinfu

809
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,030
People who insist on taking the liberal arts exam

810
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,820
If he were placed in the position of the head of the Imperial Court

811
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,490
Wouldn't there be dissatisfaction?

812
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,480
The ministers unanimously recommended

813
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,840
Unanimous

814
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,190
I didn't expect to see the ministers.

815
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,920
Such a harmonious appearance

816
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,250
It seems to be just as the rumors say

817
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,820
He's an amazing person.

818
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,370
The appointment decree was written so quickly!

819
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,070
Ministers' prompt

820
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,640
If I, a slow king, want to keep up

821
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,250
It seems that I can't even sleep now.

822
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,300
Which is

823
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,780
Take good care of your body

824
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,550
Only by giving birth to offspring

825
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,170
What kind of master is this?

826
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,530
A breeding horse.

827
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,490
Always be humble

828
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,720
Please don't forget

829
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,860
Lord

830
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,650
The Queen Mother

831
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,140
Today we are Phong Nang Zhao Clan

832
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,590
Smashed his own foot with a stone

833
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,590
Because of the false confession of Concubine Yi

834
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,830
What is this for

835
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,490
The Queen said

836
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,130
Not the result but the cause

837
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,430
What

838
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,710
It was said by the Queen Mother

839
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,060
This time, I support the appointment of Kim Byung-in.

840
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,710
To inject strength into tradition

841
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,910
Isn't it because of losing?

842
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,410
The more you lose, the more you lose.

843
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,600
Now

844
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,300
You have to act first.

845
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,360
Has the Red Moon recovered a little?

846
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,120
I'll check the status.

847
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,740
A fiery character

848
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,320
A child who keeps jumping

849
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,040
I won't be able to jump again in my life.

850
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,590
As long as you don't come with me

851
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,760
Don’t overthink

852
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,990
Ideas are sometimes like poison.

853
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,600
The deeper you get into it, the more pain you'll suffer.

854
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,960
Yongping Jun

855
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,110
How do you get rid of a lot of thoughts?

856
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,690
I

857
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,070
I will go to Hongbyeol

858
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,990
It seems that person can comfort you

859
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,450
I don't know why I say such ignorant things.

860
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,200
I'll get angry if I see it.

861
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,010
After getting angry

862
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,730
Unconsciously

863
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,420
I've already broken free from the idea.

864
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:05,720
So

865
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,830
Can you make me angry?

866
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,030
that

867
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,190
or

868
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,510
Cannot move

869
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,300
Finish

870
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,270
What's wrong

871
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,860
What's up

872
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,600
None

873
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,120
Is it injured...

874
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,040
If you touch

875
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,660
It is not possible

876
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,670
I have cramps.

877
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,820
have

878
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,090
Has it been that long?

879
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,410
Fortunately

880
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,110
The time is not long enough to be immobile.

881
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,570
If you want to do needlework, why don't you do it in the main hall?

882
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
Why must it be done in the imperial kitchen?

883
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,780
But this is needlework, right?

884
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,970
I thought it was perfect

885
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,610
But let me do it again.

886
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,820
Perfect what?

887
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,990
It seems you are very free.

888
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,730
Want me to find you something to do?

889
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,710
Oh my waist

890
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,020
Why are there so many things to do?

891
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,630
what to do

892
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,180
Come on over here

893
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,120
no

894
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,960
It's the retired dining table.

895
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,050
It's the queen

896
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,240
I've tasted new delicacies.

897
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,770
Of course I'll get tired of the old ones.

898
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,680
Come

899
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,100
Take this to the weaving bureau

900
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,380
Tell me about this feeling.

901
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,940
Match it with the size of black

902
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,270
After putting it on, it won't move around.

903
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,930
Let them make it look nice

904
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,090
yes

905
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,260
You're going to send me away again

906
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,130
Then go to the lake?

907
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,930
Have you ever seen someone who wanted to commit suicide?

908
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,060
Do you live so seriously?

909
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,150
besides

910
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,720
Maybe you just naturally forgot.

911
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,720
Isn't there CCTV monitoring?

912
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,450
What are you worried about?

913
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,430
Come on, let's work some magic now.

914
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,060
Niangniang

915
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,240
that

916
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,590
Is the meat I asked you to chop ready?

917
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,670
yes

918
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,810
Bring it here quickly

919
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,400
Bring that beef over there.

920
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,570
The Queen Mother asked me to take this over first.

921
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,690
Okay, let's go and see.

922
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,580
How long can you do this?

923
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,820
If you ask the Queen to prepare the imperial meal

924
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,790
The King and the Concubine

925
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,350
It's the Food Inspection

926
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,100
The Queen Mother sent a day bed.

927
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,140
Should we ask them not to send it up?

928
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:39,840
Feel sorry

929
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,870
How can you be so clueless?

930
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,520
Niangniang

931
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,090
The day bed is here

932
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,210
that

933
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,980
Be careful with it.

934
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,610
Not that one

935
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,010
What the Queen Mother said

936
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:47,460
Today's theme of the daytime bed is crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside

937
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,650
Crisp outside and moist inside

938
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,470
This is the first time I've heard of a four-character idiom.

939
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,450
Mencius?

940
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,050
No

941
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,220
Analects?

942
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,450
That is saying

943
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,990
Food that is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside

944
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,530
So that's it

945
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,650
The food inspector is here

946
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,560
Come on, hurry up

947
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,060
Be careful

948
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,210
Niangniang

949
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,020
The Queen Mother praised it very much.

950
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,260
How can you have such an idea?

951
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,210
Making tools like this?

952
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,250
Yeah, that's of course.

953
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,770
That's in the ultra-competitive hell of North Korea.

954
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,280
Also successful products

955
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,350
The North Korean version of a delivery man

956
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,280
Really

957
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:08,910
I am this guy

958
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,570
That's really a compliment.

959
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,990
The king's woman should show modesty

960
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,050
Shouldn't

961
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,150
You are nagging now.

962
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,540
Should I?

963
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,690
This is a question

964
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,290
No

965
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,440
Living with a proud look will make you tired

966
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:28,560
That's life.

967
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,030
I don't know what I'm saying is annoying.

968
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,880
The Red Moon Child

969
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,250
Life is safe

970
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,010
It's a blessing in disguise.

971
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,470
Through this incident

972
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,540
Yipin should understand it, right?

973
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,700
What kind of people are those Jin family members?

974
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,280
I really didn't know it would go this far.

975
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,620
It will be frightening.

976
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,550
but

977
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,620
Now is just the beginning

978
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,260
Those people

979
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,140
Never give up the prey you missed

980
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,730
The late king did not die of illness.

981
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,800
So

982
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,460
It should be said that the former king was harmed by the ancestors of the Jin family.

983
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,460
I know my sins.

984
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,260
Pull out the disgraced Kim Won-geun

985
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,280
After being sent to foster care

986
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,380
Incorporating potential bias into legislation

987
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,640
that's all

988
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,830
Faced with Kim

989
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,580
but

990
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,670
Are they the kind of people who stay quiet?

991
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,560
Fortunately,

992
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,890
Dodged the arrow

993
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,920
In the process of finding the real culprit behind

994
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:01,350
After the King ascended to heaven

995
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,570
Jin Shanggong disappeared

996
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,530
Clearly poisoning

997
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,590
If only we could act sooner.

998
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,760
The former king is still alive.

999
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,790
I told you that.

1000
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,050
It's not too late for you

1001
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,080
but

1002
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,290
If you miss it now, it will be too late

1003
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,530
Although this time it is the child Hongyue

1004
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:24,910
Next time

1005
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,770
It's you

1006
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,010
At the meeting

1007
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,890
Request for the abolition of the nave

1008
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,650
What you don't need to do

1009
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,650
This is better in the Lord's opinion.

1010
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,970
You just need

1011
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,100
Just allow

1012
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:49,650
Concubine

1013
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,990
I am deeply terrified

1014
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,130
Please help me

1015
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,760
You just need

1016
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,500
Just worry about the Lord's heart.

1017
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,780
Through this incident

1018
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,710
The Lord will look at the nave from a different angle.

1019
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,380
I don't know the darkness behind it.

1020
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,250
The weather is unusual.

1021
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,080
Is it going to rain?

1022
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,130
Han Shang Gong

1023
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,320
The room is too dark

1024
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,370
Light a candle

1025
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,580
yes

1026
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,550
You won't see His Highness tonight.

1027
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,080
Why you say that?

1028
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,400
Do you have to take everything from me to be happy?

1029
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,980
Did you replace my letter?

1030
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,330
I also replaced something more important.

1031
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,910
Can I even do something of this level?

1032
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,680
Can't move at all?

1033
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,880
What does this mean?

1034
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,810
What I know

1035
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,240
Your false

1036
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,350
What I know is true

1037
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,830
If His Majesty knew

1038
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,540
You will understand my heart then.

1039
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,620
Everyone looked at me with disgust.

1040
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,810
Look at your mood

1041
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:38,940
lifetime

1042
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,160
I have to endure this kind of gaze

1043
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,180
The fate of survival

1044
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,700
How terrible it is

1045
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,680
If you want to keep your lie

1046
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,780
Just leave the palace.

1047
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,750
Looks like you found my weakness.

1048
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,280
So

1049
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,490
Tell the truth to His Majesty.

1050
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,820
but

1051
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,120
Another truth is about to be revealed

1052
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:15,340
The Queen tried to kill His Highness.

1053
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,570
You obviously know everything

1054
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,110
Madam, you

1055
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,420
Nothing can be done

1056
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,550
You are sure

1057
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:43,300
You will lose someone precious to you.

1058
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,030
What's up?

1059
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,810
Yongping-kun also knows this, right?

1060
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,740
Your Highness

1061
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,290
A person who is very soft-hearted about guilt.

1062
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,090
For those who survived

1063
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,920
Guilt

1064
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,280
To win His Majesty's heart

1065
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,500
Do you want to do this?

1066
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,910
Hang up now

1067
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,020
It's getting wet.

1068
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,380
Hang up now

1069
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,760
The dark clouds have been unusual since a few days ago.

1070
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,010
It's raining now.

1071
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,190
This life is higher than the previous life.

1072
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,550
Why are things so complicated?

1073
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,720
Niangniang

1074
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,760
Do I also have this life and the previous life?

1075
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,760
From the perspective of parallel theory

1076
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,060
It's possible.

1077
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,590
Come

1078
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,160
This is the life we live now.

1079
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,140
This is another life.

1080
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:49,890
OK

1081
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,220
It's so difficult

1082
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,340
This child is always by the side of the empress

1083
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,960
This tone becomes

1084
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,320
So was this little dog also a human in his previous life?

1085
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,480
Maybe

1086
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,810
Is that the little one too?

1087
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,500
Of course, he might be lazy under me.

1088
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,030
What about me?

1089
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,550
Choi Sang-Gong is still Choi Sang-Gong wherever she is.

1090
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,850
What about Honglian?

1091
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:32,070
Then my parents also lived well in their previous lives, right?

1092
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,190
What

1093
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,670
My mother only has four fingers

1094
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,090
I made this by picking up stones in the cold winter.

1095
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:44,810
In my previous life, my mother must have had ten fingers.

1096
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,090
Yeah, yeah.

1097
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,700
One of my father's eyes is fine.

1098
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,170
What happened to my father?

1099
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,510
Hit by a three-foot iron rake

1100
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,310
What

1101
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,650
It's because of military service.

1102
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,890
This kind of intimidation will prevent you from having other ideas.

1103
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,810
There are more than one or two families with disabilities like this.

1104
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,640
Don't worry

1105
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,000
In the previous life

1106
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,120
Mother's ten fingers are very bright and don't need manicure

1107
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,920
Father's Two Eyes

1108
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,890
It's as shiny as if I'm wearing contact lenses

1109
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:23,310
I really want to see my mother with beautiful fingers

1110
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,100
I miss my mother too

1111
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:37,220
Our mother didn't even see her mother's face

1112
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:42,000
Why are we talking about mothers again?

1113
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,310
No, no, not that mother.

1114
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,210
It's my mom

1115
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,200
Ms. Lee Soon-hee is alive and well

1116
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,880
People who are currently interested in dancing

1117
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,140
Why cry

1118
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,930
In the imperial kitchen where women are not allowed to enter

1119
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,840
She was crying so excitedly. What a woman!

1120
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:17,490
mother mom mom

1121
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,020
Pretending to be strong

1122
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:34,660
Hey, bring the scallion pancakes and rice wine.

1123
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,710
Let's go back to the Great Hall.

1124
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,680
This rain can't stop just like that.

1125
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,550
How do you know?

1126
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,900
Are you a weather computer?

1127
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,050
I don't know what you're talking about though

1128
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,440
But my wrist hurts so much

1129
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,200
It will rain heavily at night

1130
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,390
How heavy is the rain?

1131
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:02,030
Yes, at this level

1132
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:07,000
At least it's pouring rain

1133
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,210
Heavy rain

1134
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,150
Then the lake will be full.

1135
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:28,560
Shang Shan

1136
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:30,930
It's your highness

1137
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:40,330
In order to room together smoothly, I need to read some more books

1138
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,100
It's late now. You should go down first.

1139
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:44,780
yes

1140
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,140
(Military books of the Ming Dynasty)

1141
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,610
I will come back

1142
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,550
Don't come back unless you kneel down and beg me.

1143
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,000
Don't come back

1144
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:44,850
Kneeling is my daily routine

1145
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:50,300
I can't kneel when I really need to.

1146
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,230
Niangniang

1147
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,090
Be careful

1148
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,040
Is the cold a problem now?

1149
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,870
God helps me so much

1150
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,180
The lady will catch a cold

1151
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,320
Go back soon

1152
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,730
Niang Niang Niang Niang

1153
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,890
What are you doing, girl?

1154
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:54,760
Niangniang

1155
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,720
What are you doing, girl?

1156
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,380
I really don't understand

1157
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,600
The Woman

1158
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:09,860
Mother

1159
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,580
What are you doing, girl?

1160
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,880
Why did Cheoljong come out by himself?

1161
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,970
Hey, are you out in the rain too?

1162
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,640
I'm here to apologize.

1163
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:37,140
Okay, it doesn't matter anymore.

1164
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,650
No, this matter can't just be over.

1165
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,910
I told you it's okay, why are you so clingy?

1166
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:44,900
Sticky

1167
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,860
I am a very frank person

1168
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,660
I curse when I feel happy.

1169
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,660
The kind of person who thinks thanking you will cause trouble

1170
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,820
I hate nosy people. Let's go.

1171
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,590
have a finger in the pie

1172
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,320
I mustered up the courage to apologize.

1173
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,140
Does the middle temple have to speak like this?

1174
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,300
Hey, apologies should be made according to the recipient's wishes.

1175
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,140
Is it an apology if you do it according to the wishes of the person apologizing?

1176
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,930
But there is also the king's way

1177
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,590
When will the strange tone of the middle hall be used?

1178
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,610
Today till today

1179
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,560
Tomorrow everything will be back in place.

1180
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,510
MILF

1181
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,520
Niangniang

1182
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,200
What is this to do?

1183
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,110
What should I do if I'm sick?

1184
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,030
It's too emotional to share a room today.

1185
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,350
Sleep alone

1186
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,010
I love hearing this.

1187
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,570
Very natural

1188
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,730
Why did you come out without an umbrella?

1189
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,480
It's nice to get caught in the rain occasionally

1190
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:20,150
It seems to have washed away many of those thoughts.

1191
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,110
What's wrong, my lady?

1192
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,140
You can't do this, my lady.

1193
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:31,670
Niangniang

1194
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:33,380
What's wrong

1195
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,400
Why the rumbling now?

1196
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:37,000
God helps you

1197
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:43,290
Push down towards my pelvis.

1198
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:47,170
My lady, you can't do this.

1199
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,550
Niangniang

1200
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:52,440
Niangniang

1201
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,960
The mental state of the nave gradually deteriorated

1202
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,810
He also attempted suicide

1203
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,210
The focus of the inner women was shaken

1204
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:06,170
Is it wrong to advocate the abdication of the Nave?

1205
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,000
That's right, sir.

1206
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,750
Right, right.

1207
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:14,750
Now it's our turn to help.

1208
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:35,020
Of course I have to bite the white and tender neck

1209
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,310
Endangering the center of gravity of the inner woman

1210
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:46,560
I beg you to abdicate.

1211
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,450
There was a man named Achilles

1212
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,420
Immortal existence

1213
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:00,570
But he was shot by an arrow

1214
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,030
The only weak point is the heel

1215
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,900
Then died

1216
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,030
So there is such a saying

1217
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,040
Achilles tendon

1218
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,970
In fact, the reason for his death

1219
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,870
There was no craftsman who could make him armor.

1220
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,900
If we had no weaknesses

1221
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,160
Maybe you won't be needed by the other party.

1222
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,560
We become each other's weakness before we go to hell

1223
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,520
Will complement weaknesses and be rescued

1224
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:55,760
Honglian must keep his promise and buy land in Jiangnan

1225
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,990
It's the queen

1226
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,520
Choi Sang-Gong

1227
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,040
Because I worked hard

1228
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,480
finally

1229
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,410
(Zhang Fenghuan visited here)

1230
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,380
Gotta keep a souvenir.

1231
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,810
This time we can put everything back in place

1232
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:27,310
(Preview of the next episode)

1233
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,330
More than anyone I've ever seen

1234
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,210
Unique and strange

1235
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,640
It's like being in another world.

1236
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,130
Whose soul should be called?

1237
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,360
This woman is now

1238
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,510
Completely stuck in it

1239
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,720
Compared with external crises

1240
01:19:56,790 --> 01:20:00,040
The more dangerous thing is probably the internal crisis.

1241
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,240
An internal crisis that had never occurred before has emerged

1242
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,260
That means

1243
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,090
His Highness's favorable opinion of the Middle Temple

1244
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,810
It will definitely become our weakness

1245
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,990
So today is the first day.

1246
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:10,800
What
