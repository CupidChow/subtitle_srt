1
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,640
(This drama is purely fictional and the characters, groups, events, etc. are not related to history)

2
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,120
Did you find anything?

3
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,470
Jin Bingren has already found out that the outer robe came from the palace

4
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,400
The pursuit is so tight

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
Let's catch up too.

6
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,800
This is not attack training.

7
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,220
is that so

8
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,340
What's wrong

9
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,200
This is not like the usual His Highness losing his mind.

10
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,650
I have been giving in to the pain in my limbs.

11
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,960
(Episode 8 Dangerous Liaisons)

12
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,830
(Episode 8)

13
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,140
That's right

14
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,900
Here

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,790
Let's go

16
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,040
Did you go hunting?

17
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,300
As the saying goes

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,870
Yi Yi

19
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,180
Waiting for work

20
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,320
When I rest, the enemy gets tired.

21
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,837
That's right.

22
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:07,317
but

23
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,077
Why don't you have a bow and arrow?

24
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,667
Using a bow and arrow causes shoulder and finger pains

25
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,010
It's not like it was made for hunting.

26
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,980
It was made for torture.

27
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,660
That's right

28
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,520
Bow and arrow defeated the predator

29
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,520
It's hunting, right?

30
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,720
Anyway

31
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,620
It is easier to catch prey with a trap

32
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,000
It would be dangerous if it's just the two of you.

33
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,740
Always bring guards with you wherever you go.

34
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Next time I will

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,420
Yongping Jun has always served as the captain of the imperial guard

36
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,100
How to do this

37
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,800
Wait until my uncle gets better.

38
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,810
Transfer at any time

39
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,480
yes

40
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,490
To help us train the captain

41
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,560
Take this.

42
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,910
No need, I'm fine.

43
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,470
Don't be humble

44
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,540
This is my reward to you.

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,670
OK

46
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,880
Oh, you don't know yet.

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,250
The Queen Mother has woken up, right?

48
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,800
Yeah

49
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,850
How is your health?

50
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,590
Fortunately, the jade body is intact

51
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,690
I finally made it through.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,530
Fortunately, I made it through.

53
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,490
I'm going to see the nave now.

54
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh, oh, damn it.

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,810
You shouldn't visit the sick now.

56
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,490
Now that the nave has recovered

57
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,290
The worst has been avoided.

58
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,380
I'll find the books myself.

59
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,730
Then come with me.

60
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,580
If we go together, we will definitely be on high alert.

61
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,140
Brother, can you help me look after the situation in the palace?

62
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,860
it's clear

63
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,230
Come catch me

64
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,560
It's spring.

65
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,940
Please

66
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,950
Marry me

67
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,080
I don't look good.

68
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,860
But I still have a goat

69
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh my god, I don't care.

70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,550
Your Highness

71
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,390
Keep humming Come back Come back

72
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,340
The soul did not return but the memory was restored

73
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,540
I occasionally had memories of this woman before.

74
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,880
I felt a headache at that time.

75
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,560
But this time it's as natural as breathing

76
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,190
Hong Yan, you are 19 years old this year

77
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,700
No, my name is Hong Yan.

78
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,990
But his surname is Hong and his given name is Yan

79
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,950
It's the taste

80
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,800
The memory engraved in the sense of smell has been restored.

81
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,910
but

82
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,580
How do I play so well?

83
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,720
Because I started playing it when I was young.

84
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey, my memory has been restored, and my talent has been restored too.

85
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,460
Finished

86
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,640
It's all heart failure or cadaveric syncope or something.

87
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,060
It became so confusing.

88
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,620
Oops

89
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,190
How to start from before

90
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,670
How come I'm thinking in this woman's voice?

91
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,820
Hello

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,670
Hello

93
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,780
Hello

94
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,430
sound

95
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,640
Lost it too?

96
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,850
What did you say?

97
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,620
I heard it well

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,820
I found my fingers but lost my voice

99
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,020
This situation seems

100
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,250
Mermaid Princess?

101
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,830
Disguising arsenic as rodenticide

102
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,430
The witness who was sold to Han Shanggong

103
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,390
There are also various situations in which the imperial kitchen was moved

104
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,350
Make sure these two points cannot be used as a handle

105
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,390
I have something to tell Minister Yijin.

106
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,680
That's weird.

107
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,980
This palace is spacious.

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,420
Why do I feel more spacious today?

109
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,250
The Queen Mother Arrives

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,870
Oops

111
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,980
No

112
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,670
I

113
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,990
I have decided to give the Queen some time.

114
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,320
Just you know

115
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,150
What

116
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
This is in accordance with the rules of the inner women.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,950
We have to wait.

118
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,160
but

119
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,390
Ready to use anytime

120
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,000
But keep it completely confidential

121
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,870
We fixed the problem this time.

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,260
The Queen Mother may be with someone who wants to harm the Queen Mother.

123
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,740
Those forces are related

124
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,170
If you leave it alone

125
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,470
The Queen may still be in danger

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,810
Do you want to harm the forces of the Central Palace?

127
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,330
The matter of jumping into the lake was made clear in person.

128
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,420
That was a suicide attempt.

129
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,660
This time it's a health issue.

130
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,320
Anything else?

131
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,440
Since entering the palace

132
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,690
Life-threatening situation

133
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,970
So I feel suspicious

134
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,320
Understood

135
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,750
The Royal Highness is not here but we have to prepare for the Imperial Conference

136
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,070
There are many things to prepare

137
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,220
I'm leaving

138
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,500
Your Highness, what's the matter?

139
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,620
Let's go see the Queen Mother

140
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,060
Yeah

141
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,490
Big Brother Big Brother

142
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,340
Sir, you are here too.

143
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,190
Let's chat.

144
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,270
Take care

145
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,090
It's only noon and we have to go back now

146
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,000
I stayed up all night last night and was confused

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,830
Why do you have to stay up all night?

148
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,540
It's for a secret mission.

149
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,010
Because of this, I experienced terrible things.

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
Oops

151
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,530
so

152
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,490
Did you find anything?

153
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,690
Big brother, something big happened

154
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,240
I am in love with a woman I shouldn't love

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,770
What kind of woman is she?

156
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,470
Today I feel like the whole palace is empty.

157
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,110
I feel empty inside.

158
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,990
Think carefully about what is going on

159
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,280
There is only one person missing in the palace now

160
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,020
There is such a person

161
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,610
The Queen Mother

162
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,450
I really want to like the Queen Mother

163
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,060
What

164
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,390
I actually love my cousin

165
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,940
This is incest.

166
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,610
Same surname and same clan

167
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,970
This is almost a close relative

168
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,840
Plus she is

169
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,850
The woman who has married His Majesty's other wife

170
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,520
Am I crazy?

171
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,340
It's not crazy in a good way, it's crazy in a dirty way.

172
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,550
Letâ€™s not talk about this for now

173
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,800
More importantly

174
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,950
She is much older than me.

175
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,730
That's really bad, isn't it?

176
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,330
Is it the things older than you that are important now?

177
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,100
Why are you suddenly angry?

178
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,180
You're saying weird things.

179
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,330
sorry

180
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,860
I won't say it again.

181
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,670
No

182
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,300
I was wrong to be angry with you

183
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,800
Never got angry.

184
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,930
A brother who never cursed anyone

185
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,130
After becoming an official, he changed

186
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,140
I feel like this because it's ridiculous.

187
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm really not mad at you.

188
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,510
Why do you think so?

189
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,070
I will always remember her

190
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,800
Holding an umbrella for the lady

191
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,240
Always by the side of the empress

192
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,210
I have been bringing medicine to the empress.

193
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,880
Running around all the time

194
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,680
The maids beside the Queen

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,080
Name: Hong Yan

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,840
What

197
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,100
Since you keep thinking about Hong Yan

198
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,040
How can you say you are in love with the Queen?

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
Who am I?

200
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,400
I am the only descendant of the sixth generation of my family.

201
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Kim Hwan

202
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,770
It's impossible for me to love a maid like this.

203
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,880
So of course it's the Queen Mother

204
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,840
I won't say that to the maid

205
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,770
I cheer for your hard-working love

206
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,580
Oops

207
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,080
(Children should learn first)

208
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,170
Zhao Huazhen

209
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,250
Niangniang

210
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,810
Your Highness?

211
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,830
Went to the middle temple's house

212
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,840
Why did you go there suddenly?

213
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,370
The nave regained consciousness

214
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,550
Go to the father-in-law's house under the pretext of visiting a patient

215
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,650
Oops

216
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,570
Are you hurt?

217
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,870
nothing

218
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,210
I want to see the lady too.

219
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,180
How come you came here in person?

220
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,610
Skinny guy

221
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,190
Fat guy

222
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,090
A guy like a wooden pole

223
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,490
Short guy

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,170
Although it looks strange

225
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,390
But there is one thing in common

226
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,700
that is

227
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,480
this

228
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,320
You who have the best shooting ability

229
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,950
I personally selected the shooters.

230
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,760
I am average in height and build.

231
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,470
I don't know which category it belongs to.

232
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,530
You should be in charge of the role of the tactless one.

233
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,740
So that's what I call you.

234
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,790
Japanese troops

235
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,040
Until now, there is nothing else.

236
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,830
You who can only stay at the border

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,850
As long as you have this gun

238
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Will become the first in North Korea

239
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Just like me

240
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,720
Although guns can kill people

241
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,800
but

242
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,790
It can also save people

243
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,080
Then practice shooting

244
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,350
Although it is annoying

245
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,030
But to save the country

246
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,370
emission

247
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,040
I come to you when I need something.

248
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,240
One is the Phoenix Hairpin

249
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,090
Phoenix Hairpin's Words

250
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,570
Is it for the middle temple?

251
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,270
If you want to give it to the middle temple

252
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,000
I told the clothing department directly.

253
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,600
yes

254
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,600
I don't need the gilded ones for the nave.

255
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,680
It's made of jade.

256
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,310
but

257
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,510
According to the palace rules, the Phoenix Hairpin

258
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,850
No one except the queen can wear it.

259
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,980
That's right

260
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,400
Yeah

261
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,210
And what I need

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,270
Another object is

263
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,650
really

264
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,180
Just to call His Highness out.

265
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,320
Speed up to arrive as soon as possible

266
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,320
yes

267
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,950
Speed up

268
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Before the Nave reveals all the secrets

269
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,390
The difference from the Little Mermaid is

270
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,950
After losing my voice

271
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,490
Do I want toes or fingers?

272
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,880
Is this the difference?

273
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,900
How could it be possible that he was so dizzy?

274
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,900
Am I going to lose myself like this?

275
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,900
If I had lived here forever

276
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,000
Director Han

277
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,250
He can get everything he wants

278
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,430
For treason

279
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,390
Just wipe out the Han family.

280
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,760
Don't say you were born.

281
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Just wipe out their three generations.

282
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,320
But which Han is he?

283
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,130
Why are my moods so up and down?

284
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,420
But are all the people here from the male temple party?

285
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,670
How do you play springboard so well?

286
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,320
How can a North Korean woman not know how to jump?

287
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,590
This is the only way to see

288
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,040
Solutions outside the walls

289
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah

290
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,220
There is such a deep meaning

291
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,730
Yeah

292
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,130
I found out after living here for a week

293
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,880
The life of North Korean women is harder than you think

294
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,380
Plus, I'm still the middle palace.

295
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,590
But for revenge

296
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,870
Let's go

297
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
It's good if you can't smell it

298
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,800
This will block this woman's memory.

299
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,080
Recovering my own voice

300
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,150
From today on, I live for revenge

301
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,270
To do that requires a huge amount of power.

302
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,320
Hong Yan

303
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,060
As the middle temple, I want to have great power

304
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,980
what to do

305
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,930
There is a way

306
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,370
What

307
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,490
anyway

308
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,440
Giving birth to a prince

309
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,180
How can a production say such a thing?

310
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,000
yes

311
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,030
I have a very powerful sister Chun Yuan

312
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,700
What is Chunyuan sister?

313
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,560
What a nice name.

314
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,100
Queen Chunyuan

315
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,730
Our Queen Consort

316
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,940
Hong Yan

317
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,090
If I want to please the Queen Mother

318
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,390
what to do

319
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,940
No matter what, I want to give birth to a prince

320
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,820
Gifts are better

321
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,200
What is better?

322
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,230
It's small but shiny and expensive.

323
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,480
Very beautiful

324
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,950
Wait a moment

325
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,750
The taste

326
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,700
I remember

327
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,310
I remember

328
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,100
This is the backyard of Tianzi.

329
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,900
That's Xuan in the other room, right?

330
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,840
Yes, I got more wealth during this period.

331
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,970
The entire warehouse is full.

332
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,970
Heaven and Earth

333
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Except for this warehouse

334
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,780
If we add the wealth of the eight islands of Korea

335
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,110
It is possible that all the words in the Thousand Character Classic can be used.

336
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
It's really blinding.

337
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,800
This splendid life with a golden spoon

338
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,780
this

339
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,150
This one too

340
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,680
Except for those two

341
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,090
All of this here

342
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,360
Do you want all of these?

343
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,760
Take all of them and enter the palace immediately

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,280
I could hear the father-in-law fainting.

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,420
From now on I will be the queen

346
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,280
Niangniang

347
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,950
His Majesty is here now.

348
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,980
What's going on?

349
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,040
I'll be back soon.

350
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,630
You ask him to go back to the palace and wait.

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,530
What are you talking about, madam?

352
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,060
Taking advantage of the opportunity to get close to the Queen

353
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,600
There is no problem between us and the Lord.

354
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,710
What to do

355
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,010
I've already said that my stance is very clear.

356
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,370
Really

357
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
Why did you come here in a luxury car?

358
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,820
The royal family is all of Guan race.

359
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,020
Please pay attention to etiquette, my lady.

360
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,300
It's fine

361
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,500
Thus, Jin Jia Zhaorong was canonized as the middle palace

362
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,590
Congratulations on your ascension

363
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,450
Picked up on the roadside

364
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,540
nave

365
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,260
I see your face suddenly turns red.

366
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,860
Are you out of breath again?

367
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,490
Whose face is as red as a flower?

368
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,270
Is it another soul coming out to confuse me?

369
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,380
Get Out of Here, Kim So-yong

370
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,130
From my body

371
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,810
Don't hurry out of your body.

372
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,320
What is this doing?

373
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,630
I have nowhere to go now

374
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,350
Are you hitting the flowers or using the flowers to hit yourself?

375
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,170
Always

376
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,610
Stop it

377
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,880
I won't be robbed

378
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,480
This is mine

379
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,070
I didn't know you would be so interested in this.

380
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,650
Who is in line with your wishes?

381
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,760
Just like a corpse

382
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,810
That's just a little better.

383
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,880
Why do I always cheer up?

384
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,320
It gets even weirder.

385
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,620
The weird thing is that I'm not

386
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,680
It's your spirit

387
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,760
What do you pick up on the way here?

388
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:26,840
This kind of ghost line

389
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,510
It has been passed down for more than two hundred years.

390
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,340
I really picked it up on the way here.

391
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,280
good

392
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,540
Know

393
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,030
It's true.

394
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
good

395
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,020
The king does not lie

396
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,480
Good good good

397
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,750
Why is this so?

398
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,730
His Majesty the Lord

399
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,260
His Majesty the Lord

400
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,240
You come and visit my little place in person

401
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,430
I am really terrified.

402
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
No, get up.

403
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,720
Of course I have to come and visit the Central Temple.

404
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,850
Is everything okay, father-in-law?

405
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,760
Of course, of course.

406
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,820
Let's go in and sit down first.

407
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,360
good

408
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Then Your Highness, please accept the reception first.

409
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,700
I was busy going back to the palace.

410
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,670
I'll take my leave first.

411
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,660
Let's go

412
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,110
Isn't it so fast?

413
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,990
Are you planning to return to the palace today?

414
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,960
Because I am the type who recovers quickly.

415
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,560
No matter what

416
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,580
I can just get up now

417
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,240
The father-in-law is right.

418
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,900
There's nothing to worry about.

419
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,620
Take your time to recuperate

420
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,630
Because I'm worried

421
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,620
I don't know what will happen if I'm not in the inner palace

422
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,360
Everything is peaceful

423
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,380
More than when the nave was here

424
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,960
It is possible to

425
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,990
Feel sorry

426
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,450
I told you to do it well.

427
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,980
The result is still poor treatment.

428
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,750
I got familiar with palace life so quickly.

429
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,870
I feel like spending time with this old man

430
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,560
So unsatisfactory.

431
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,200
In order to fulfill my duties as a clerk

432
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,990
I failed to take care of my father's heart.

433
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,380
So

434
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,840
I'll leave tomorrow

435
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,440
So

436
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,450
Let's have tea together.

437
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,510
Got scammed

438
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,730
Let's go

439
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,460
Why is this happening?

440
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,380
There's something you need to do.

441
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,360
There is something that shouldn't exist

442
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
Take it from me.

443
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,730
Keep it secret

444
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,870
yes

445
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,140
Seeing the two of them so harmonious

446
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,590
I have no regrets even if I die now.

447
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,540
I'm sorry I should have come earlier.

448
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,040
What is this saying?

449
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,910
Just to hear about the two of you

450
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,320
I'm already grateful enough

451
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,290
The Queen Mother was originally different from other women

452
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,830
So I'm curious about what's going on.

453
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,210
What kind of environment did you grow up in?

454
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,940
This is the environment.

455
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,140
Because there is no mother

456
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,420
I raised her alone.

457
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,170
Because I'm afraid of not being enough

458
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,530
All in any aspect

459
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,830
I paid twice as much attention.

460
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,430
How much suffering it must have been.

461
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,030
What suffering?

462
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,030
My empress has been able to do everything well since she was a child.

463
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,460
I've heard all the rumors

464
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,340
However

465
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,760
The central palace originally had a strong personality.

466
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,070
Don't confide in me.

467
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,270
I don't know if I'm lacking

468
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,920
Women's minds are complicated

469
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,830
To understand the heart of the nave

470
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,420
It's really not easy.

471
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,950
How could it be possible that Your Highness is not enough?

472
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,310
For men

473
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,230
A woman's heart is like

474
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,890
It's as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.

475
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,460
Don't understand

476
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,110
There is always a difference in understanding between husband and wife.

477
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,910
They are all relationships that are based on misunderstandings.

478
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,990
What's this

479
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,360
Because if there had been no misunderstanding at the beginning

480
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,790
There won't be any mistakes leading to marriage.

481
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,660
I want to understand everything about you

482
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,460
Shut up

483
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,690
I want to go around the place where the nave grew up.

484
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,870
Is it convenient?

485
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,160
Also chat with the middle temple while walking

486
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,000
Even though it's just an ordinary life

487
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,380
Nothing special

488
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,860
But if you want

489
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,480
Then I'll show you the way.

490
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,720
Then you two go.

491
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,750
It would be more advantageous to go with the middle temple

492
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,080
Just one night away

493
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,450
I want to watch it again even though I'm watching it this way

494
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,190
What's stuck here?

495
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,300
My spoiled mole

496
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,500
Why does it look different today?

497
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,820
So

498
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,700
The Queen, come along too.

499
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,470
Let's go

500
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,860
You two, please come out slowly.

501
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,310
I don't know if the house is tidied.

502
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,600
do what

503
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,440
Didn't we agree on No Touch?

504
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,790
After tasting again

505
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,490
No touch is a really good phrase.

506
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,780
Even if we disagree

507
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,410
But coexistence can still be happy

508
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,940
This isn't very good.

509
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,800
Acknowledge differences

510
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,470
Beyond this difference

511
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,900
Towards understanding

512
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,560
What kind of philosopher?

513
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,790
I just said No touch and I thought about that.

514
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,340
That's right

515
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,500
You are a political guy.

516
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,550
Don't you like me being with the father-in-law?

517
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,450
I originally wanted to show some filial piety to my father-in-law.

518
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,240
Please help me

519
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,110
The strong body of the worker

520
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,230
The action is unusual.

521
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,630
Plus

522
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,320
The structure here is inexhaustible at a glance

523
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,460
Let's go

524
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,700
good

525
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,360
It would be a pity if you didn't watch it

526
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,030
You can see it,

527
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,900
This white porcelain and that screen

528
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,840
It was a very tortuous thing to obtain.

529
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,770
Can I watch it up close?

530
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,130
Of course, of course

531
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,990
Look here

532
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,550
There's no need to look at the back of the screen.

533
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,270
A good work will have a good back view too.

534
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,250
Watch out for the nave

535
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,090
What's wrong

536
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,480
Today I am particularly tempted by the beauty of the nave.

537
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,160
Even insects are attracted.

538
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,460
What

539
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,080
There

540
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,090
Where is behind

541
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,180
Look there, look there

542
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,020
No

543
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,880
No where

544
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,280
where

545
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,850
Now it's flying away

546
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,020
How does this look in the middle temple?

547
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,110
Strong pen power

548
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,660
Landscape painting is gorgeous

549
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,790
It should be expensive.

550
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,630
There are so many precious items

551
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,550
I'll be uneasy.

552
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,900
Too

553
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,550
There should be additional guards at night.

554
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,260
No additional guards were arranged

555
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,630
To protect these objects

556
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,920
The guards who were paid for

557
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,650
I don't know when I will worry

558
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,220
This world has become a thief

559
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,560
So

560
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,970
There is a person who has worked in our family since childhood.

561
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,260
Trustworthy slave

562
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,910
Train them

563
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,880
It can also be seen as killing two birds with one stone.

564
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,480
This also saves costs

565
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,270
How wise!

566
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,960
So how many of these people are there?

567
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,110
this

568
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,350
It's a secret in home training.

569
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,880
So

570
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,230
You don't have to say

571
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,660
But since it is my nave where I grew up

572
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,790
I'm still a little worried.

573
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,190
My nave?

574
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,700
About 26 people

575
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,020
What secrets could there be between Your Highness and me?

576
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,590
Used to guard the main hall

577
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,400
That's a sufficient number.

578
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,670
I felt relieved after listening to it.

579
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,280
So to speak

580
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,620
There shouldn't be a wooden study room that's hundreds of years old.

581
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,170
This kind of thing

582
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,740
The price is not easy to find.

583
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,910
You will be shocked

584
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,130
Yeah

585
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,860
Are you shocked?

586
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,640
Just on the way past

587
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,360
There is a rock that I cherish very much

588
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,120
The shape is exactly the same as the Phoenix King

589
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,630
In fact

590
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,560
It is said that if you plant that seed, this family will have offspring.

591
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,560
This is really amazing

592
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,190
Just a little further and you'll be there

593
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,060
Come with me

594
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,300
This damn rock

595
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm going to destroy it this year.

596
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,170
The arrogant tone of the middle temple

597
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,960
It sounds good again.

598
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,290
When the nave first became like this

599
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,700
I thought it was a disguise

600
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,270
Carrying the responsibility of the family to try to shake me

601
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,080
It turned out to be a misunderstanding.

602
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,500
The nave is just

603
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,570
only

604
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,170
Just impolite

605
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,050
Because I have too much

606
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,830
It's okay to be without manners

607
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,580
I mean it when I say I want to understand the Middle Temple.

608
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,740
How is it growing?

609
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,760
Can be in the North Korean yangban family

610
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,930
Grow up a woman like Namiya

611
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,380
I'm really curious

612
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,050
Nothing to be curious about

613
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,220
A woman like me

614
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,310
It is impossible to come out of North Korea.

615
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,310
I am the only one in the world

616
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,500
Really arrogant.

617
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,410
it hurts

618
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,430
(Iho's words to the second governor of Guo about reinstating the king after he was deposed)

619
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,270
What's wrong

620
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,840
nothing

621
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,150
No matter how you look at it

622
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,880
It's all because I'm too worried about my wife.

623
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,150
And the appearance of hurting the body

624
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,280
I will call the servants to bring His Highness in immediately.

625
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,170
Please take care of His Highness.

626
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,600
What's wrong

627
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,570
Like seeing a ghost

628
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,640
This familiar feeling

629
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,370
Save me

630
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,490
It's all because of me

631
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,490
I killed him.

632
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,200
In this well

633
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,990
Your Highness

634
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,100
Your Highness

635
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,670
Yipin

636
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,130
What's going on

637
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,890
Still so pale

638
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,760
No

639
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,390
Father

640
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,560
Serve His Highness inside.

641
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:52,530
I have something to ask Yipin here.

642
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,220
I came here out of concern for the queen's health.

643
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,400
Now it seems that His Highness's health is more worrying

644
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,120
What's going on

645
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,840
I just couldn't sleep at night.

646
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,820
Just temporary dizziness

647
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,980
Let's go in first

648
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,580
The imperial physician was also called.

649
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,920
No need for the imperial physician to come

650
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,990
Just take a break and you'll be fine.

651
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,060
Go up to serve

652
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,310
Yes Yes

653
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,180
Be careful. Be careful.

654
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,090
Be careful. Be careful.

655
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,530
You go out first

656
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,420
Are you dizzy again?

657
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,870
No

658
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,480
Just sit and rest.

659
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:04,000
I heard that His Highness would share his childhood memories of his life in Hanyang.

660
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,180
Most of it is lost

661
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,620
Because I was still young

662
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,710
I left Hanyang again due to some bad things.

663
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,020
I don't quite remember

664
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,830
That's really great

665
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,320
What I mean is

666
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,470
It is better to forget bad memories quickly.

667
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,040
I thought so too.

668
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,060
It finally opened Pandora's box.

669
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,390
Different from what you heard

670
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,030
Are you okay?

671
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,030
I still think I won't.

672
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,910
Don't worry

673
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,020
I didn't tell His Majesty anything.

674
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,980
Isn't it because of this worry?

675
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,020
Did you run here like this?

676
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,470
So what do you want?

677
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,080
There must be a reason for calling His Highness here.

678
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,960
I really want to get along well with you.

679
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,140
It should be said that it is because of the source of hormones

680
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,110
Or is it the last act of kindness?

681
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,830
What I mean is

682
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,610
For your existence

683
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,830
We could have gotten along well.

684
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,730
but

685
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,490
I see

686
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,090
Your entity

687
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,300
Entity?

688
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,560
You are a fake Kim So-yong

689
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,530
Is this a lie now?

690
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,370
My memory is back

691
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,100
What comes back should not be memory

692
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,400
It's the original appearance.

693
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:43,740
After all, it's still right

694
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,750
The person who used to be the source of my hormones

695
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,030
I'll tell you this.

696
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,310
You should talk to His Highness first.

697
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,730
Hear from others

698
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,910
What a betrayal it would feel like.

699
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,820
It was a threat.

700
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,610
I understand what you want.

701
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,260
The fruit plate is here

702
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,520
It doesn't make sense.

703
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,210
Living with a twisted fate

704
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,870
People are twisted like this.

705
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,760
No charm

706
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,850
Come in

707
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:32,980
Your Highness

708
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,310
Is this conversation over so soon?

709
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,430
You go down first

710
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,710
Are you okay?

711
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,760
It's no big deal.

712
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,700
I'm sorry for making you worry so much.

713
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,880
So polite

714
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,130
There are only two of us here.

715
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,520
Your Highness

716
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,060
Since the Queen Mother has also returned to her original appearance

717
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,980
Come with me to the palace now.

718
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,840
Can't

719
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,820
I have more to see

720
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,030
Things to watch

721
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,870
What is

722
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,740
Treat guests like this

723
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,040
A good location has been arranged

724
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,580
Move over there.

725
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,670
I'll go back to the palace first.

726
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,000
So

727
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,880
I am waiting for His Highness in the palace

728
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,380
Be careful

729
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,010
Grandpa Enyanjun

730
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,610
Falsely accused of a crime

731
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,540
Being pampered since childhood resulted in being punished

732
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,960
Father Jeon Hee-jun

733
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,420
Living a pampered life with my father

734
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,350
Death at that time

735
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,280
My grandmother and my aunt were implicated and died

736
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,510
The rest of the relatives are in this environment

737
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,240
As expected, he was also punished for treason.

738
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,900
It's not a crisis escape NO.1

739
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,180
How come all the family members died at once?

740
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

741
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,100
What look

742
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,380
Like I'm pathetic.

743
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,200
Please stop laughing.

744
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,540
I was already very sad

745
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,660
That's why they say being soft-hearted means losing.

746
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,020
Why do I think of something useless?

747
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,390
how

748
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,900
What do you want from me?

749
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:36,830
Why post it like this?

750
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,830
I want to get it from the middle temple.

751
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,960
If we find out that the Nave is hostile to us

752
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,160
I will take her life with my own hands

753
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,010
I hope the nave is not my enemy

754
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,400
Even if they are not friendly forces

755
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,240
Just

756
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,830
Don't be my enemy.

757
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,980
You still have the eye for people.

758
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,220
Even if I am a friendly

759
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,270
Not very helpful people

760
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,970
But it would be really scary to become an enemy

761
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,080
Will bite to the end

762
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,260
Niangniang

763
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,030
Master Jin Bingren is here

764
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,920
Why are there so many guests?

765
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,530
It's totally gourmet restaurant quality.

766
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,090
Are you okay?

767
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,160
Being too lively is the problem.

768
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,890
What's up?

769
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,790
The Imperial Court came here

770
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,290
This is where His Majesty the Lord and His Majesty the Queen are.

771
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,450
It's the same as in the palace.

772
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,910
Empress of the Middle Temple

773
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,230
From now on, we, the Yijinfu, will protect you.

774
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,770
Since I already brought the Guards

775
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,730
Don't worry, retreat.

776
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,090
Then the guards will protect His Highness.

777
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,130
People of the Imperial Palace, please protect the queen.

778
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,810
Is this a waste of manpower in unnecessary places?

779
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,750
Then let the Guards retreat.

780
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,180
The sentry is standing in the wrong direction.

781
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,490
From the outside, it looks like a whistle.

782
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,530
From this side, it is surveillance

783
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:01,980
My daily actions

784
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,740
It seems that the eight characters are surrounded by Jin

785
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,050
Who

786
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:34,890
Are you okay?

787
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,830
no

788
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,330
This is

789
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,250
How could you

790
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,140
Is this someone you know?

791
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:48,570
Please wake up

792
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,610
Master

793
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,380
Please save my brother

794
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,480
Big brother?

795
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,910
Why on earth did this man raid the nave?

796
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,040
If you are not careful, something bad will happen in the central palace.

797
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,490
Get out of here, woman.

798
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,490
I'm asking you to get out of this body.

799
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,220
roll

800
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,020
nave

801
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,810
hateful

802
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,950
Why is that fool here?

803
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,890
What do you want to do?

804
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,230
See that face

805
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,930
Because I'm so happy

806
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,290
That's right

807
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,260
I

808
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,220
I am from North Korea

809
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,860
Miss Hong Yan Miss Hong Yan

810
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,510
mother of the nation

811
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,890
He came to see the lady's maid.

812
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,560
Is it true that you didn't recognize me after I dressed up?

813
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,240
The Imperial Court also said it would protect the Central Palace.

814
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,730
This proves

815
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,170
Why are you so dissatisfied with the protection of the Yijinfu?

816
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,720
Are you planning something?

817
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,090
What are you referring to?

818
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,610
I heard that there have been a lot of thieves in the warehouses in the capital recently.

819
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,440
so what

820
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,080
So we need to be more vigilant.

821
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,650
Block this.

822
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,770
Is Your Highness trying to earn some extra pocket money?

823
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,790
No matter what, he is the king in name only.

824
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,910
I have a matter with the Yijinfu today.

825
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,340
Not finished

826
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,520
Stay with me till the end

827
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,850
I originally had outstanding martial arts skills

828
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,180
I used Qigong to dodge his kick instantly.

829
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,720
Nothing happened

830
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,820
But I want to confirm something with you.

831
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,940
So I requested this.

832
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:08,910
OK

833
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,240
mine

834
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,990
Request another one

835
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,870
I don't know if I can ask you

836
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,160
Please tell me

837
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,510
Please give me

838
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,120
Blow it up

839
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,230
How come even your breath is so fragrant?

840
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,790
Now this moment

841
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,820
What are your inner feelings?

842
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,110
Unknown

843
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,290
The only way to know this is

844
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,620
one

845
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,280
Excuse me

846
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,840
confirm

847
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,430
No, why is it you?

848
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm sorry I didn't recognize the noble man.

849
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,660
This expression

850
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,580
What does it mean?

851
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,600
It is a smile that hopes to be rewarded with kindness.

852
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,070
A smile that smells better than my breath

853
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,750
Still quite presentable

854
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,550
Your Highness is also very good

855
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,460
After all, he is the king

856
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,580
Is this a lot so soon?

857
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,280
It's finally time

858
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:38,710
Dog and Wolf

859
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,170
Dog wolf?

860
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,160
Dog and wolf time

861
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,040
Normal people during the day

862
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,810
When I became a dog and a wolf

863
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,770
As a man, I only ask you one question

864
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,500
You won't be

865
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,340
You have some undue ambitions for the Central Palace.

866
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:26,970
If it's not like this

867
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,030
Why is it like it wants to eat me?

868
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,330
Occasionally there are men who have no future.

869
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,010
Not giving love

870
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,770
Show love to others

871
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,220
Unable to endure

872
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,050
I

873
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,670
is possessive

874
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,540
A useless man

875
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,940
The best woman

876
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,560
I don't know even if I put it next to me

877
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,350
A useless man

878
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,010
What are you saying?

879
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,160
I don't mean anything to you.

880
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,270
no

881
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,150
I shouldn't be

882
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,740
Look into my eyes

883
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:35,040
you

884
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,800
Generosity is also a virtue of a gentleman

885
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,560
I won

886
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,280
Hey

887
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,700
Do as much as you are paid

888
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:38,710
it turns out

889
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,280
We met like this

890
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,580
Worried about harming the concubines

891
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,550
Also kept distance

892
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,070
Please don't say that, Queen Consort.

893
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,790
I have a gift

894
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,330
This is

895
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,680
Suitable for the position beside the master

896
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
A concubine

897
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,570
From all aspects

898
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,990
You are the real candidate for the Middle Temple.

899
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,400
What are you watching

900
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,570
only

901
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,640
Watching the moon reflected in the lake

902
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,870
In the palace

903
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,330
The horrible thing that's been spreading around

904
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,910
I mean ghost stories and stuff like that.

905
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,650
One of them

906
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,000
Like today, on a full moon night

907
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,540
Don't let the lake reflect your appearance

908
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,800
After I left

909
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,980
My image left in the lake

910
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,290
Will act alone

911
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,760
Maybe I

912
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,400
Will be trapped in the lake forever

913
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,140
Now

914
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,810
It's time to get out of the lake.

915
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,610
I can go there after I come back.

916
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,990
How urgent is this?

917
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,270
Toilet

918
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:17,470
Over here

919
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,740
I have something to hide.

920
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,100
Haven't told anyone

921
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,760
A secret that only belongs to the Queen and me

922
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,670
Werewolf on a full moon night

923
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,580
It absorbs moonlight and turns into a wolf.

924
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,440
But we know

925
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,330
The full moon is just

926
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,890
To release the deep hidden

927
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,400
The Wolf Within Us

928
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,850
Just an excuse

929
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,110
This is the chamber pot.

930
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,430
I really can't stand this kind of art.

931
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,100
Tango

932
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,400
Are you awake?

933
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,010
I'll go to the middle temple and see for myself.

934
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,620
nave

935
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,810
To our poor king

936
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,900
In the name of justice I will not forgive you

937
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,810
The accuracy is not good, so

938
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,380
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

939
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:36,220
So why are you standing there?

940
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:39,670
It's here

941
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,000
No touch today

942
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,380
Is the lady okay?

943
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,930
(Preview of the next episode)

944
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,730
That's how I got into trouble.

(Preview of the next episode)

946
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,500
If you can't remember it like the first night
