1
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,709
(This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations, )

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,968
(and events are unrelated
to historical events.)

3
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,509
I smelled this that night
too. It filled the entire room.

4
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:29,189
This scent was embedded
into his sleeve too.

5
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,408
It was you.

6
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:01,988
You were...

7
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,818
In the worst-case scenario,
I must go for my left sleeve.

8
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,910
What I needed most at this moment was you.

9
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:18,068
(Episode 4)

10
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,738
This tea.

11
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,878
I am glad that you like it.

12
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,460
He has been staying close by
me all this time to figure out...

13
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,800
if I remember that.

14
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:36,100
Your Highness, why do you look so pale?

15
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,518
You are even sweating.

16
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:42,229
It's okay.

17
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,628
I'm just tired after staying up last night.

18
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,729
At times like that,
this tea is very helpful.

19
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:51,768
You should have some
and go straight to bed.

20
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,499
Taste it.

21
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,218
You may drink it now.

22
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,949
I will pour it myself. You may be excused.

23
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,049
Please have some. The aroma is very nice.

24
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,988
I have to pretend not to know.
That's the only way I can live.

25
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:59,498
Why does he keep
telling me to drink the tea?

26
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,238
Perhaps there's poison in it?

27
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:05,808
What is wrong?

28
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,808
It tastes...

29
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:11,979
very good.

30
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,748
Thank goodness.

31
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,889
How long has it been since you had dinner?

32
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,213
If I'm on an empty stomach,
the poison will spread faster.

33
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,729
That's why he wants to know.

34
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,799
You are quite interested
in what I do these days.

35
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,768
I had been busy.

36
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,020
I always had a great interest...

37
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,299
in you and your family.

38
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,609
Then...

39
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,308
you should have some of this.

40
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:46,718
Consider it a display of affection.

41
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,759
If that is what you would like.

42
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,199
Maybe it isn't.

43
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,878
You little jerk.

44
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:18,878
You said it was a display of affection.

45
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:21,930
What are you trying to do?

46
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,688
Let go of me. I need to vomit.

47
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:29,229
Do you think that I poisoned you?

48
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,058
Why? Is there a reason why you think so?

49
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,399
Let us wait.

50
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,799
If time passes and you are okay,

51
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,068
my innocence will be proven.

52
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:42,969
What if I don't want to?

53
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,748
If you were poisoned,
your tongue will be paralyzed first.

54
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,030
If you feel as though your
tongue is becoming stiff,

55
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,948
do not hesitate and move your hand.

56
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,959
Do you think I can't do it?

57
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:02,118
I think you can.

58
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,529
Furthermore, I think you will do it well.

59
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,599
You got that right.

60
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:11,399
Even if I die, I won't die alone.

61
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:22,008
(Episode 4: The Man Who Knows Too Much)

62
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,849
- Your Highness.
- I cannot do this anymore.

63
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,304
I cannot do this even
if my life depends on it.

64
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,988
I feel like I am going to die too.

65
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,399
Be careful.

66
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,669
Do you intend to hurt me in your sleep?

67
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:51,909
Something is strange.

68
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,438
What did you make me drink?

69
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,308
I have a question for you.

70
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,434
The other night,
when I went to the royal villa,

71
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:01,329
where did you go?

72
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,919
I'm going to leave.

73
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:04,948
I have to get out of here.

74
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,459
I can't die here when the way
out is right in front of my eyes.

75
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:20,839
What happened to you that night?

76
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:24,550
This is dangerous. I
shouldn't say anything.

77
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,039
I...

78
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,459
What did you say?

79
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,878
That night,

80
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:32,149
you tried...

81
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:36,988
to kill me.

82
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:39,019
She knows.

83
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,818
If you knew this,

84
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:44,828
why did you hide the fact
that you knew until now?

85
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,128
What are you planning?

86
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,628
Because I didn't know.

87
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,899
I just found out thanks
to that tea you drink.

88
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,790
That's too bad.

89
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:59,779
If I had known sooner,
I would've killed you.

90
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,209
You evil jerk.

91
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,959
Regardless of how crazy
you are over another girl,

92
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,423
how could you try to kill your wife?

93
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,349
How can you call yourself a human?

94
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:12,019
Jo Hwa Jin is your royal concubine.

95
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,589
Isn't being able to legally
commit adultery enough?

96
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,488
Did you really have to kill
your wife with your own hands?

97
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,459
She does not know why.

98
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,128
My Queen.

99
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:28,769
You heard something you
should not have heard that night.

100
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,969
What did you hear?

101
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,609
Answer me! What did you hear?

102
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,049
There is another reason?

103
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,888
So you're saying you
have a very valid reason...

104
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,258
why you're trying to kill this woman?

105
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,359
Is that it?

106
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,529
Stop kidding yourself.

107
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,340
Whether it's because I heard something...

108
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:55,910
or because you're madly
in love with another woman,

109
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,969
there's only one reason
why you'd try to kill me.

110
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:00,599
It's because I'm weaker than you.

111
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,790
You wouldn't have been able
to attack me if I was stronger.

112
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,860
It's because I'm easy to kill.

113
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,909
It's because I'm weaker than you.

114
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,419
That's the real reason.

115
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:20,618
Here. Try again.

116
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,128
Prove that you're just a murderer
who would kill a weak person.

117
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,379
Darn it.

118
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:44,249
Gosh, I'm so mad.

119
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,978
Your Highness.

120
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,649
How dare he make light of me?

121
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,170
If I was the real me,
I could knock him out with just one punch!

122
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,419
Darn it!

123
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:36,999
What happened?

124
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:41,698
I always thought I was a weak
person fighting against a strong person.

125
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,169
That is why I believed that
my actions and methods...

126
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,838
were all valid.

127
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,049
The Queen already knows...

128
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,088
that I tried to kill her.

129
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:09,799
I thought there were plenty of
reasons why the Queen should die.

130
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:12,309
It was not only because she
overheard our conversation.

131
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,698
It was because she condoned
and contributed to their tyranny.

132
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:19,639
That is why I believed it
was valid to kill the Queen.

133
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,279
However,
that was nothing but a cowardly excuse.

134
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,430
I am still not confident enough to
fight against my strong opponents,

135
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,259
so that is why I went after the Queen,
who is the weakest.

136
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:37,828
- Your Majesty.
- If I am fighting against the weak,

137
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,029
how am I any different from those people?

138
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,568
You must focus on the righteous goal.

139
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:50,938
If the results are righteous,
the means are also righteous.

140
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,409
The Kim clan is not one you
can beat with a righteous method.

141
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:01,978
You must not be shaken.

142
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,619
I am sure that they are
planning something scary.

143
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,588
The Queen is the only
one who knows right now...

144
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,458
as she just found out herself.

145
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,533
You must prevent the Queen
from speaking right now.

146
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,198
It is only a matter of time
before they all find out.

147
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,180
I will not use cowardly methods anymore.

148
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:21,369
Your Majesty.

149
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,390
I judged the Queen easily
because she is a part of the Kim clan.

150
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:27,208
However,
everything she has done was unexpected.

151
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:31,729
In any case,
I'm not the person you think I am.

152
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,178
What you see isn't everything.

153
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:37,119
The Queen told me that
she was a different person.

154
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:40,640
Perhaps the Queen
was trying to tell me that...

155
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:43,928
she is cut from a different cloth
and can make a different decision.

156
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,858
What are you expecting from her?

157
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:47,558
The Queen is nothing but...

158
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,799
a member of the Kim clan.

159
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,669
I may be nothing more than a puppet king,

160
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:56,539
but they cannot do anything
just based on the Queen's words.

161
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:58,608
They do not have any definitive evidence.

162
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,578
I will watch to see what kind
of decision the Queen makes.

163
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:06,078
That will help me figure out
what kind of person she is.

164
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:22,728
I found the source of this fabric,

165
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,129
and it is from the palace.

166
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:29,269
If you were to steal this
precious gift from the king,

167
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:31,269
they would get caught.

168
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,539
It would not be possible with
the power of any noble person.

169
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:40,478
Goodness. I wonder how much
you will pay me for my efforts.

170
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,149
I went through quite a lot, Young Master.

171
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,058
Good job.

172
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,180
From now on, please leave all the hard,
difficult, and dirty things...

173
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,369
to me, sir.

174
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,698
The palace...

175
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,858
Simply having...

176
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,869
Royal Noble Consort Eui shake
the King's heart will not be enough.

177
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:11,068
We need an opportunity that
will capture his heart for sure.

178
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:16,608
Right now, the Royal Noble
Consort's weakness is the lake incident.

179
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,848
If that is the case...

180
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,619
We must create the criminal.

181
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,889
It must be a weak person
who has no one on their side,

182
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,659
like a baby deer that
does not have a mother.

183
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,659
It must be someone like that.

184
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,120
Where did the person playing tujeon go?

185
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:21,689
What are you doing instead
of putting down your card?

186
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:25,208
You would not even
notice if I stole your nose.

187
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:27,218
The thing is...

188
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,619
Never mind. It is nothing.

189
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:33,088
You must be worried about something.

190
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:39,228
I think that vicious criminals are
roaming the streets these days.

191
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:42,280
I made a new friend recently.

192
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,529
His name is Lee Saeng Mang.

193
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,299
But I think...

194
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,579
he was also attacked
by a terrible person...

195
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:50,349
who is roaming around
outside of the Palace.

196
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,420
"Also"? Did someone else get attacked?

197
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,779
You know that I am very keen.

198
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,649
My cousin, Byeong In,

199
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,779
seems to be...

200
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:05,188
trying to find someone
from a piece of a robe.

201
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,718
My sixth sense tells me...

202
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,389
that the owner of the robe,
who is a heinous criminal,

203
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,029
must have harmed...

204
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,629
my friend...

205
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,568
and had a run-in with my cousin.

206
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,468
What are your thoughts on that?

207
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,760
I cannot believe they are wasting
such a talented scholar like you...

208
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,219
at Royal Confucian Academy.

209
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:31,478
This is a huge loss for our kingdom.

210
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:36,789
It looks like you are as sharp as I am.

211
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:45,188
I am certain something
dangerous is happening out there.

212
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:01,819
Spare me.

213
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:05,009
I will do anything you ask
of me. Please spare me.

214
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,130
My lord. My master.

215
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,378
My lady.

216
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:12,449
I do not know who you are,
but I am begging you.

217
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,818
Please.

218
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,539
I did not see anything.

219
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:19,929
Raise your head.

220
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:23,168
No. I do not wish to die.

221
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:34,009
You will not be able to see my face anyway.

222
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,259
Someone powerful wants an answer from you.

223
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,158
I do not know anything.

224
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,358
What would a lowly girl
like me know anything?

225
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,209
You know...

226
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:59,128
who tried to harm the Queen
by pushing her into the lake.

227
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,898
You can only live once
you give me that name.

228
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,014
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

229
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:00,439
It tastes awful,

230
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,259
but it sure is effective.

231
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:12,209
Yesterday, the Queen's father
brought something very special.

232
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,808
Drinking it on an empty stomach...

233
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:16,239
helps me feel rejuvenated
throughout the day.

234
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:20,679
It seems he always knows how
to get his hands on the rare items.

235
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:23,600
As he is an advisor of
the Royal Cuisine Office...

236
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,400
and handles the royal offerings,

237
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,759
that only seems fitting.

238
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,049
By the way,

239
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,009
how is our plan regarding
the royal villa going?

240
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,759
I have the right person in mind,

241
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,378
so I have prepared it.

242
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,479
I see. Once it is wrapped up by today,

243
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:55,848
there will be one less
thing for me to frown about.

244
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:57,588
Yes.

245
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,158
This will be an ironclad plan this time.

246
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,469
Kim Byeong In...

247
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:21,160
has been investigating the incident...

248
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,709
with a piece of His Majesty's robe.

249
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,088
I took care of the robe.

250
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,689
But now that the Queen knows the truth...

251
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:37,628
If Kim Byeong In finds out
everything and comes after me,

252
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,279
my judgment about the Queen has been wrong.

253
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,598
- It is too risky to gamble that.
- I am aware.

254
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:46,229
However, if I am right,

255
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,269
innocent people will not be hurt.

256
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,078
It is my father-in-law's first day
as the royal guard commander.

257
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:08,189
Your Majesty.

258
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,759
I thought you were still at Daejojeon Hall.

259
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:13,729
I came here for an inspection.

260
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,929
I need to share important
knowledge with Prince Yeongpyeong.

261
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,308
Are you that shocked?

262
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:31,148
Head Eunuch.

263
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:34,348
Yes.

264
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,229
What a psychopath.

265
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:48,959
I thought he was just a dummy,
but it was all an act.

266
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:51,969
A king tried to kill a queen himself?

267
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,920
If I expose him to a
huge scandal like this one,

268
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,189
I'll be in the middle of a conflict
and it will be more dangerous.

269
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,049
I'll wait until they finish
filling the lake with water.

270
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,838
I'll stay quiet until then
and go back to my life.

271
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:04,890
Your arms must have gone numb.

272
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:06,874
You have been crossing
your arms for a long time.

273
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,519
This helps me calm down.

274
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,358
I couldn't stop talking
even when I wanted to stop.

275
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,969
What did he put in my tea?

276
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:21,628
I knew it. I shouldn't let my
guard down even for a second.

277
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:25,969
By the way, if he wanted to kill me,
he could've just poisoned me.

278
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,650
Why...

279
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,019
Whatever.

280
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,039
Why must I care about that psychopath?

281
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,853
I need to go and check
on the progress of the lake.

282
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,989
Do you have some kind of whip?

283
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:38,489
I need to take care of this immediately.

284
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,779
Your Highness.

285
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:49,189
The Grand Queen Dowager has called for you.

286
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:53,070
Come on. I don't need her now.

287
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,199
Darn it.

288
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,799
This is annoying. Why does
she want to see me again?

289
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:24,058
Gosh.

290
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:59,429
Let us keep going. You
can do it. Hang in there.

291
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,180
What are you doing? Hurry.

292
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:04,568
- Over here. - Keep moving.

293
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,150
Hurry.

294
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:08,350
Hurry up. You must hurry up.

295
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,090
This is urgent. You must hurry up.

296
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:12,408
You must keep going.

297
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,848
Be careful. Hurry up.

298
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:21,100
I cannot hold it in any longer.

299
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,019
I must go to the bathroom.
I will be back soon.

300
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:25,049
We are so busy right now. Hurry up.

301
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:27,058
Hurry.

302
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:36,398
I heard that you were coming,
so I was waiting for you.

303
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:39,299
But what is this about?

304
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:44,090
The Queen Dowager is very keen on you.

305
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:45,808
I am honored.

306
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,289
I heard that your younger
sibling became a slave...

307
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,989
because of your family's debt.

308
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,908
Yes. I only have my younger
sibling left in this world.

309
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:55,378
I heard you are quite concerned...

310
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,100
and that you are doing
everything you can to restore...

311
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,400
your younger sibling's social standing.

312
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,888
I am saving up my money in every way I can.

313
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:05,658
But the debt is way too big.

314
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,709
As the Queen Dowager cherishes you,

315
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,269
she has made an offer.

316
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:14,039
You will never get a
chance like this again.

317
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:19,868
How long will it take?

318
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,638
It will not take long.

319
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:27,418
Make her confess to this as well.

320
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:30,148
And the person who sent the letter...

321
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:32,719
is the Queen Dowager.

322
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:35,918
Yes, my lord.

323
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,239
If I take the blame for such an act,

324
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,939
my younger sibling and
I will not be able to live.

325
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:44,328
You do not have to
worry about your sibling.

326
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,650
Your sacrifice...

327
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:48,539
will give a new life to
your younger sibling.

328
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,838
But...

329
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,209
How long do you think...

330
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:56,949
your younger sibling will be
able to handle such a hard life?

331
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,729
What if something bad happens tomorrow...

332
00:26:58,753 --> 00:27:01,078
including the misfortunes?

333
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,888
"Something bad"?

334
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,929
Did you ask for me, Grand Queen Dowager?

335
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,429
I summoned you...

336
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:22,799
for I wish to put you in charge
of something very important.

337
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:25,239
Gosh, what now? What a hassle.

338
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:28,019
It is too early for me to be in
charge of an important matter...

339
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:30,608
for I still have a lot to learn.

340
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,479
Well, is that so?

341
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,479
What a shame.

342
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:38,370
I wish to select royal concubines
who are absolutely exquisite...

343
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:41,719
and can smite and bewitch the King.

344
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,888
I suppose I have no
choice but to do it myself.

345
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:45,959
Mencius said...

346
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:48,410
that the virtuous enjoy abundant support.

347
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,959
Develop virtues, and help will follow.

348
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:51,709
Even though I still have a lot to learn,

349
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:54,338
many are willing to help me
due to my efforts to be virtuous.

350
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,509
Hence, I will do my best.

351
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:59,209
By the way,

352
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:02,408
as for the royal concubines,
what is the maximum?

353
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:04,648
"Maxi"?

354
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,378
Oh, what I meant was...
How many can we select...

355
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:10,318
at the most?

356
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:13,588
Well, the classics say...

357
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:16,969
that a king should have 6 royal concubines,
3 royal wives,

358
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,570
9 concubines, 27 consorts,

359
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,779
and 81 royal mistresses...

360
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:24,529
- serving him. - Hold on.

361
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,668
6 plus 3.

362
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,269
Nine...

363
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:31,009
27.

364
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:32,868
And 81?

365
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:36,408
However, we should keep it
modest and select about three.

366
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,878
Come on.

367
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,219
I mean, yes!

368
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,818
Absolutely.

369
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,100
His Majesty already
has one royal concubine,

370
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,170
so we should select two more. Correct?

371
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,789
No, select three more.

372
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:55,158
Royal Noble Consort Eui brought
a court lady named O Wol with her.

373
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:57,529
Oh, that maid who follows her around?

374
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,568
She said something foolish,

375
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:02,039
out of loyalty to Royal Noble Consort Eui.

376
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:04,989
She said that you jumped into the lake...

377
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,420
in front of her to frame Jo Hwa Jin.

378
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:08,908
She has been spreading such rumors.

379
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:13,878
The King lied to protect Hwa Jin,
and she ruined it all.

380
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,700
The King?

381
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:18,670
I am about to take away
the King's favorite toy,

382
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:21,259
so I would like to gift him with a new toy.

383
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:27,910
All right. I would like you to
prepare today's lunch as well.

384
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,299
I can no longer eat meals
prepared by someone else.

385
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,398
Gosh, this is not good.

386
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,908
What if you eat the healthy
foods I make every day...

387
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:43,648
and start looking younger than I do?

388
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,078
I would not like that.

389
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,754
I should completely win
her over until the lake fills up.

390
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,586
So things are going the
way Kim So Yong wanted.

391
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:08,356
She has managed to totally trap Jo Hwa Jin.

392
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,126
Hey, woman. You'll be punished for this,
big-time.

393
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,166
I feel bad for Jo Hwa Jin.

394
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,186
Who cares though? None of
this will matter when I go back.

395
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,686
I don't have time to
worry about someone else.

396
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,705
I need to figure out my life first.

397
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,775
Go faster.

398
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:28,646
Oh, you two ladies can take your time.

399
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,446
If you rush, you might trip and fall.

400
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,285
Faster!

401
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,025
Move it. Faster, faster, faster!

402
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,037
Faster! Yes, that's it. Go faster. Faster!

403
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,666
Faster! Move it.

404
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,475
That's it!

405
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,356
Gosh, this feels nice.

406
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,096
Only high-class folks
can enjoy this privilege.

407
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,295
(Royal Guard Division)

408
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,805
This is nice!

409
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,696
Hello, Lord Kim.

410
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,215
This is your last day, is it not?

411
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,227
You must be sad.

412
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:41,815
No,
I am sure you will do a much better job.

413
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,116
My gosh.

414
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,696
What a handsome horse.

415
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:54,735
It was bestowed by His Majesty
for the royal guard commander.

416
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,535
Hop on.

417
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:00,475
Gosh, no. It has been ages
since I last rode a horse.

418
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,017
And the position is not
officially mine until I receive...

419
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,761
the certificate at the meeting later today.

420
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,515
- I will do it another time. - All right.

421
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,346
My gosh, Lord Kim. Can you ride a horse?

422
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:14,985
Who might you be?

423
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,606
I am His Majesty's best friend.

424
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,406
And the court maids named me
as 1 of the 5 most charming men...

425
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,495
You do not need to know who he is.

426
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,971
Prince Yeongpyeong was not
even included in the ranking.

427
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,416
Anyhow, your physique...

428
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,987
is not exactly suitable
for horseback riding.

429
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,987
And this horse is exceptionally tall.

430
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:37,076
Can you even hop on with
those short legs of yours?

431
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:42,676
What are you talking about?

432
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,245
Back in the old days,

433
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,567
I used to ride hands-free.

434
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,497
That is how good I was.

435
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,136
I was always so relaxed
while riding a horse.

436
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,455
Once, I fell asleep on a
horse and even had a dream.

437
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,826
Gosh, I am dead serious.

438
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:59,265
I will prove it to you. Hold this.

439
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,487
You do not have to do
this. Do not force yourself.

440
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,576
Goodness, shut it!

441
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,076
I can still do it!

442
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:15,846
Well, I suppose I was wrong.

443
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,416
Hey, can you...

444
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:22,555
Please... Oh, boy.

445
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,995
See? That was easy.

446
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,995
Goodness.

447
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:45,475
No! Oh, dear.

448
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:48,475
There, I got you.

449
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:03,426
Gosh, oh boy.

450
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,606
Gosh, my goodness.

451
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,247
- Lord Kim! - My legs! Gosh, my legs.

452
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,647
My legs!

453
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,505
Potatoes, salt, and milk.

454
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:15,605
Milk?

455
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,200
I have never heard of
such an ingredient before.

456
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,715
It is also called tarak.

457
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,997
Oh, I see.

458
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,566
It is such a rare ingredient,
yet she will waste it as if it is water.

459
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,185
There's no way you'd have butter.

460
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:29,715
Do you have black pepper?

461
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,156
Yes, Your Highness.

462
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,176
It is more valuable than gold,
yet she will waste it as if it is sand.

463
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,266
But she would not listen to me,
so I will not say anything.

464
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,266
I can hear you, okay?

465
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:46,346
- Your Highness! - My gosh.

466
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,375
I told you to take your
time. Why did you run?

467
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,576
Court Lady Choi was on her way here too.

468
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:57,296
She's not young. What if
she fainted while running?

469
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,415
I am here!

470
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,167
I may be a little slow,

471
00:35:03,191 --> 00:35:05,386
but I will never faint.

472
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,295
She is a persevering lady.

473
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,676
- All right. Pour it in.
- Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,116
That's it?

475
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:38,066
- Are you kidding me?
- Well, the thing is...

476
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,956
Your Highness,
tarak is such a rare ingredient.

477
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:44,065
That is why I need it.

478
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:46,276
When it comes to cooking,
ingredients are everything.

479
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,665
If we squeeze all the milk out,
calves will starve.

480
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,587
And she is thoughtful.

481
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:53,536
My gosh, that is sad.

482
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:56,256
Have you heard of intermittent fasting?

483
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,505
Fasting once in a while
is good for your health.

484
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:02,076
All right. Fill the cauldron
up to here with tarak.

485
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,386
If it's short of even one drop...
You know what happens, right?

486
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:10,485
Yes, Your Highness.

487
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:17,426
Goodness.

488
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,065
Who are you?

489
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,065
How dare a girl enters the royal...

490
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,746
"Achoo, achoo."

491
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,045
Come here.

492
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:39,827
What's your name?

493
00:36:39,851 --> 00:36:41,556
Dam Hyang.

494
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:44,185
You're raising a dog at the palace.

495
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,855
The dog has a higher position than I do.

496
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,776
The dog came over here
with an envoy from Ming.

497
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,496
They said the dog has a
rare pedigree or something.

498
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:57,366
Ming? That was 200 years ago.

499
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,857
If the dog mated with other
breeds for the past centuries,

500
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,375
this one is just a mutt.

501
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,906
What's the mutt's name?

502
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:08,026
The dog does not have a name.

503
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,815
Really? Then,

504
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:13,485
- let's call it D-0-9. - "D-0-9"?

505
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:14,755
Look.

506
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,185
All right.

507
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:23,837
D-O-G. Here's another
way to spell this word.

508
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:25,446
(Dog)

509
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,766
D,

510
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,996
0...

511
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,165
Look. It looks like a "dog", doesn't it?

512
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,816
So it's D-0-9.

513
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,306
I see. D-0-9.

514
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:42,775
You keep coming here because you're hungry.

515
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:45,915
Wait.

516
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,786
All right.

517
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:54,556
Ta-da.

518
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,226
Try it.

519
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,335
Here.

520
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,316
Why won't you eat?

521
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,145
I cannot eat this because it
looks too pretty, Your Highness.

522
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:16,296
Don't worry. It's not free.

523
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,627
After you finish that,
help me prepare the potatoes.

524
00:38:18,651 --> 00:38:19,786
She cannot.

525
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,366
I will not object to your presence
here as you are the Queen.

526
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,906
But traditionally, women are not allowed...

527
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,937
to touch the royal meals.

528
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:28,537
They can only help decorate the dishes...

529
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,937
and serve the meals.

530
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:32,401
A lowly girl like her without
any official position cannot...

531
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,647
A small child like her,

532
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:38,435
cannot be involved in cooking the meals.

533
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:43,605
Gosh, you're such a boomer.

534
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:47,327
You should try it too. "What a boomer."

535
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:49,156
- What a boomer. - What?

536
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,085
Gosh, you pronounced that
word perfectly and clearly.

537
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,815
So you can call him a b00mer too.

538
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:56,815
Go on. Eat.

539
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:03,956
It tastes like I am eating the cloud.

540
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,536
You're good at describing food.

541
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,036
You could have your own eating show.

542
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:11,935
Gosh.

543
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,875
By the way,
isn't she too young to be at the palace?

544
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,986
Her parents failed to pay taxes,

545
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,227
so she was caught,
wandering on the streets.

546
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:22,275
So all of her family became slaves.

547
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,767
And her so-called father
ran away by himself.

548
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:28,286
Goodness. How can a father do such a thing?

549
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:30,755
Royal Chef.

550
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,090
How could you say that in front of her?

551
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,776
Dam Hyang.

552
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,866
You should only see and
hear beautiful things, okay?

553
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,866
F-0-0-L.

554
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,605
Go ahead.

555
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,366
F-0-0-L.

556
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,576
What? F-0-0-L?

557
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,906
Fool!

558
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:07,485
Why are you making the potato balls so big?

559
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,025
What's taking so long with the milk?

560
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,996
Your Highness.

561
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,716
I have milked all the cows
we have at the palace...

562
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,565
until there is not a
single drop left in them.

563
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,505
Good job.

564
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:28,976
Yes, Your Highness.

565
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,985
The milk porridge.

566
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,616
Why are you adding the potato
balls into that precious porridge?

567
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,866
Gosh.

568
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:52,187
Goodness. Are you my mother-in-law?

569
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:54,891
These days, mothers-in-law try
not to cross their daughters-in-law.

570
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:56,206
What?

571
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,886
Why would mothers-in-law
worry about crossing them?

572
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,505
That is absurd.

573
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,415
Okay.

574
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,965
I will bring this to her personally.

575
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:41,871
Font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E04 'Mr. Queen'</font> <font color="#ff8080">"The Man
Who Knows Too Much"</font> <font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font> <font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

576
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:56,266
This is delicious.

577
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,766
By the way,

578
00:42:01,711 --> 00:42:04,505
as the food got cold,
the potato balls have gotten hard.

579
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,796
And this precious milk
porridge spilled over the bowl.

580
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,446
That is quite a shame.

581
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:10,915
I understand, though.

582
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,715
No one can be perfect all the time.

583
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,066
What's the point of cooking a perfect dish?

584
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,956
It's not served properly.

585
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,077
How could I deliver the food
swiftly before it gets cold...

586
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:26,906
without spilling any food?

587
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,565
That's the key.

588
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,755
Life experts.

589
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,637
Take it.

590
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,176
I told you to glue that ages ago.

591
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,837
You still did not finish this?

592
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,196
- What are you doing? - Hurry up.

593
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,316
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

594
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,476
Your Highness.

595
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,827
I need a palanquin. A food palanquin.

596
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:49,946
Your Highness.

597
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,386
Your Highness.

598
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,696
A food palanquin?

599
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,437
- A food palanquin? - A food palanquin?

600
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:57,786
- What's a food palanquin?
- A food palanquin?

601
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,906
A food palanquin?

602
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,926
- What? - A food palanquin?

603
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,781
- What are you saying? - A food palanquin.

604
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,096
- What? - A food palanquin.

605
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,565
Be careful.

606
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,005
All right.

607
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,235
Okay.

608
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,835
Her Highness is here.

609
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,986
- All right. 1, 2. - 1, 2.

610
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,627
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

611
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:26,426
- 1, 2. - All right.

612
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,437
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

613
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,167
- What? This is it? - 1, 2.

614
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:33,107
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

615
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:34,267
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

616
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,006
- Did you really stay up all night?
- Yes, Your Highness.

617
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,377
We worked in shifts.

618
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,807
We brought water and pour
it into the lake all night long.

619
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:41,417
But this is a big lake.

620
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:42,446
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

621
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,316
My gosh. It took only one
day to get rid of the water.

622
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,716
But why does it take
so long to fill it again?

623
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,716
As the lake is elevated,
removing the water...

624
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,476
can be easily done by making holes.

625
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,227
I bet they were slacking
because there was...

626
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:56,215
no supervisor at the lake.

627
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,985
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

628
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:08,426
How about a bowl of makgeolli...

629
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:11,625
after we are relieved
of our duties tonight?

630
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,877
Gosh.

631
00:45:13,901 --> 00:45:15,965
What do you think? What?

632
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,605
I asked you a question! You punks.

633
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:21,875
Gosh.

634
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,206
What brings you here alone?

635
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:29,176
Her Highness wants cool refreshments.

636
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,076
The Queen?

637
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,715
Is that so?

638
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,926
Then, I will make a simple
bowl of azalea hwachae.

639
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:42,837
After the first harvest,

640
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:46,025
the omija berries have ripened nicely.

641
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,046
And the brewed tea of the berries
will be sweetened with honey.

642
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,165
I will add pears and tangerines
to make it more refreshing.

643
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,557
That way, I do not have to
be extravagant and use ice...

644
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,676
while still making it
taste cool and refreshing.

645
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,145
Since there are no azaleas right now,

646
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,127
I will use the evening
primrose. I will take out the pistil,

647
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,966
put some starch on it,

648
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,026
put it in some boiling water,

649
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,855
and then cool it in some cold water.

650
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:11,456
Then I will place them on
top of the hwachae bowl.

651
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:15,426
Then the finishing touch will
be three pine nuts at the end.

652
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:24,605
I can make such a beverage
with my eyes closed.

653
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:25,866
Like this.

654
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,676
I watched you make it
with your eyes wide open.

655
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,016
Why does she only watch me?

656
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,456
It's embarrassing me.

657
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,406
Keep up your energy.

658
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,116
Your Highness. This is the
beverage that you asked for.

659
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:13,386
What? Okay. Let me see.

660
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,215
I'm not in any position to be like this,

661
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:18,301
but they say if you can't beat them,
join them.

662
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,855
This is nice.

663
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:26,426
Hey!

664
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,306
How long will this take?

665
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,517
At this rate, we will be done by tonight.

666
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,735
You have until sunset.

667
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,227
That is impossible.

668
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,526
My gosh. Then be
sure to finish it by today.

669
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,775
If not, it will be off with your heads.

670
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:44,886
Yes, Your Highness.

671
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,596
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

672
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,136
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

673
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,386
Tell the royal chef...

674
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:56,437
- to give everyone here this drink.
- 1, 2. 1, 2.

675
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:58,346
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

676
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,906
- To all these people? - 1, 2. 1, 2.

677
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,116
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

678
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,266
- 1, 2. 1, 2. - 1, 2. 1, 2.

679
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:15,545
Seeing as to how she's here already,
she must have fallen for my skills.

680
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:20,085
I am sure she wants me
to make another beverage.

681
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,136
Yes, please speak.

682
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,855
The Queen would like you
to make another beverage.

683
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:29,395
I knew she would want some more.

684
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,895
Did she drop the bowl
because it was so delicious?

685
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,435
Or did she shed tears?

686
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,406
Court Lady Choi, I am...

687
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,576
this kind of person.

688
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,526
- Royal Chef. - Royal Chef.

689
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,275
Goodness, that is enough.

690
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,296
Royal Chef, the thing is...

691
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,625
Of course. I will make
some for you as well.

692
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:03,125
I guess you also like my beverage...

693
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,565
more than average.

694
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,716
Did you see what I did there?

695
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,835
That was funny.

696
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,145
I will make another one. Please wait.

697
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:31,525
While you're making one,
could you make some more?

698
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:35,996
Of course. How many would you like?

699
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,506
- Here you go. - This looks delicious.

700
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,326
Thank you.

701
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,965
- Thank you, Your Highness. - No problem.

702
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,676
This is so precious. Thank you,
Your Highness.

703
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:58,446
At least you are aware.

704
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:02,136
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Highness.

705
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,685
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Highness.

706
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,025
No problem. This isn't much.

707
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,855
Go ahead and drink up.

708
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,696
This is so delicious.

709
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,766
They are so easy to put to work.

710
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,476
My hiding skills are so perfect
that even a bird was fooled.

711
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:33,685
I made such an effort,

712
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,855
and I was just starting to feel thirsty.

713
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,150
You have been making
such an effort since yesterday.

714
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:51,965
Although I am not sure what you are doing.

715
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,766
Can you see me?

716
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:58,645
Of course. You are so easy to see.

717
00:50:58,711 --> 00:50:59,806
I'm easy to see?

718
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:02,627
That is what I mean.

719
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:04,897
Earlier,
two court ladies had no idea I was here,

720
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,627
and they said all sorts of things.

721
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,556
I must return to assist the Queen.

722
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,255
The bowl.

723
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:00,505
Since I was just caught,

724
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:02,576
this is enough for today.

725
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,246
When she saw me,

726
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:16,215
I went to her and became a flower.

727
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:28,636
Oh, no.

728
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:37,206
You will get hurt.

729
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,456
Do not touch it with your bare hands.

730
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:13,206
The feeling that makes you
willing to get hurt and be in pain.

731
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:14,806
That is love.

732
00:53:31,671 --> 00:53:33,426
I am asking around.

733
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,917
I am sure it is nothing serious,
so do not worry too much.

734
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:39,435
O Wol is not the type of person
to disappear without a word.

735
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,760
I am certain that something
has happened to her.

736
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,176
The Queen Dowager is entering.

737
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:48,645
Queen Dowager.

738
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,275
Everyone may leave.

739
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,956
You must bear in mind
everything I say from now on.

740
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,506
The only person you can
trust in this palace is me,

741
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,926
the person who is on the same boat as you.

742
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:12,835
You must tell me everything
without leaving anything out.

743
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,935
That is the only way
that child and we can live.

744
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,335
This is so nice.

745
00:54:47,941 --> 00:54:51,335
Prince Yeongpyeong, Head Eunuch, and me.

746
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,306
Head Eunuch.

747
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:57,857
As the Queen wanted my book,
"Changes of Zhou",

748
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,215
I had asked you to get me
another copy. Did you get it?

749
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,355
Pardon?

750
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,406
You never gave me such orders.

751
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,556
My goodness, Head Eunuch.

752
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,866
Are you losing your
memory with your old age?

753
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:14,125
I am certain I told you to do so.

754
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:17,401
You should go to Gyujanggak Library
right now and give them my orders.

755
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,716
Do you want me to do that right now?

756
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,017
Then do you intend to forget again?

757
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:26,176
I will do so after I accompany
you to Daejojeon Hall.

758
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:30,256
It is not like I am going alone,
Prince Yeongpyeong is guarding me.

759
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,946
What are you worried about?

760
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,645
You should hurry up and go.

761
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,855
Yes, Your Majesty.

762
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,676
My goodness, did I just bump into a rock?

763
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,875
Head Eunuch.

764
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,786
- Are you hurt? - No, I am fine.

765
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,267
Looks like your nose is broken.

766
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,525
No, my nose!

767
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:14,426
Gosh, am I bleeding? Goodness!

768
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,496
This is just what my nose looks like!

769
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:20,046
No way. How can a
human nose look like that?

770
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,676
You should head over to
the Royal Infirmary right away.

771
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,965
Goodness,
gracious. I told you that I am fine!

772
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,846
O Wol, the court maid who is missing,

773
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,557
entered the palace with
Royal Noble Consort Eui...

774
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,835
on the day when the
Queen fell into the lake.

775
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,727
I bet they are planning to
make her give false testimony.

776
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:36,426
All of this happened as
soon as the Queen found out...

777
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,930
that you were the one with the sword.

778
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:41,145
Her target is Royal Noble Consort Eui,
not me.

779
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:43,585
Revenge.

780
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:46,025
Is that the Queen's choice?

781
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,196
Your Majesty.

782
00:56:53,101 --> 00:56:54,196
Hwa Jin.

783
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,835
I apologize.

784
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:05,576
You have nothing to apologize for, Hwa Jin.

785
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,645
All of this is my fault.

786
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,746
What do you mean?

787
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,915
A little while ago,
I tried to get rid of the Queen myself.

788
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,506
She wishes to get back at me,

789
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,130
and that is why she is trying to
frame you for the lake incident.

790
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,596
They use this trick all the time.

791
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:28,426
Using fabricated evidence
to trap innocent people.

792
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,636
I will tell everyone that
I tried to kill the Queen.

793
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:35,576
Your Majesty.

794
00:57:37,081 --> 00:57:40,406
Both you and I know a
great deal about revenge.

795
00:57:40,611 --> 00:57:42,057
Inflicting the same harm or pain.

796
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:43,576
That is what revenge is.

797
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:45,631
The Queen wishes to hold her sword...

798
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,985
to Hwa Jin's throat
just like what I did to her.

799
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,355
The only way we can kill
her vengeful determination...

800
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,255
is by me kneeling before her.

801
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:57,855
There is no other way.

802
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,747
She planned all this...

803
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,335
to frame me.

804
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:06,605
I will step in and put
an end to all of this.

805
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,435
Do not forget about the great
cause you have been working toward.

806
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:14,227
Do you not remember all the insults
you have been putting up with...

807
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:16,357
for the past two years to
prepare for what is to come?

808
00:58:16,381 --> 00:58:17,676
For the sake of the great cause,

809
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,246
Your Majesty must get
out of this unscathed.

810
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,525
Never in my life did I wish to be a king,

811
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,355
a mere puppet king at that.

812
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:34,965
I came to this palace for one reason.

813
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,665
To not run away anymore.

814
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,786
Thus, do not tell me to run away.

815
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,016
I will not run away again.

816
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:02,337
I will search every nook and cranny...

817
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,255
and find O Wol.

818
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:07,512
They must be interrogating
her somewhere in the palace...

819
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:09,631
so they can punish
Royal Noble Consort Eui...

820
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,191
as soon as they manage to
squeeze a false statement out of her.

821
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,065
I must ask Your Majesty to wait...

822
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:16,706
until I find her.

823
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:18,605
I will.

824
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:22,045
However,
I will step in in the worst-case scenario.

825
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:24,846
And if that happens, do not stop me.

826
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,145
This is a royal order.

827
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,786
Too many lives have been lost already.

828
00:59:30,461 --> 00:59:31,715
I do not wish...

829
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:34,755
to lose anyone else today.

830
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:52,676
Your Majesty must not get hurt.

831
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:55,206
I will not be hurt.

832
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,397
Whether I must kneel and crawl
on the ground like they want me to,

833
00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:00,181
or play dumb and call
it a misunderstanding,

834
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,450
I will do whatever it takes to
make sure I will not be hurt.

835
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:06,085
Your Majesty.

836
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:27,462
Lads, you should all put on your uniform.

837
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,172
We are looking for a court maid.

838
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:32,871
We suspect that she is
somewhere in the palace.

839
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:36,911
Make sure no one sees you.

840
01:00:37,146 --> 01:00:39,482
Be extremely careful.

841
01:00:55,997 --> 01:00:59,161
Gosh, I'm bored out of my mind.

842
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,132
Is there anything I can
do to entertain myself?

843
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:06,823
Your Highness.

844
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:08,993
A few days ago,
I managed to get my hands...

845
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:11,011
on these silk threads from Qing.

846
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:14,263
You've been carrying this around every day?

847
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:17,951
I figured you'd eventually want
to pick up your hobby again.

848
01:01:19,356 --> 01:01:21,221
I'm sorry, but no thanks.

849
01:01:21,327 --> 01:01:22,433
When I sew,

850
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:24,332
I prick my fingers with the needle nonstop.

851
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:25,491
That is why...

852
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:28,322
I prepared this as well.

853
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:32,561
Are you giving me the finger?

854
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,931
What do you mean? This is a sewing thimble.

855
01:01:36,177 --> 01:01:38,502
Are you craving finger taffy,
Your Highness?

856
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:40,741
Court Lady Choi.

857
01:01:41,376 --> 01:01:42,942
Do you really not know what that means?

858
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:48,681
Hong Yeon, you don't know either?

859
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:55,181
Is there a meaning behind a sewing thimble?

860
01:01:55,387 --> 01:01:58,621
I prepared this so you won't
prick your fingers while sewing.

861
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:02,221
Gosh, I don't know if I believe you.

862
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:16,823
Your Majesty, I was concerned.

863
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:18,542
You got here before I did, Head Eunuch.

864
01:02:19,546 --> 01:02:22,346
It took me a while as I wanted to
keep my royal dignity while walking.

865
01:02:25,557 --> 01:02:27,121
Is the Queen inside?

866
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:30,721
I heard Her Highness is
by the lake at the moment.

867
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:33,792
The lake? Why?

868
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,031
What Royal Noble Consort Eui told me...

869
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,831
is the same as that the King had told me.

870
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,531
She said she did not even
see the Queen that night.

871
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:48,871
She told me that she ran
away upon hearing a loud thud.

872
01:02:49,847 --> 01:02:53,342
However, I am not sure whether
or not she is telling me the truth.

873
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:55,122
But it seems that the woman...

874
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,482
spotted by the Head Inspector
and the workers who were stealing...

875
01:02:58,957 --> 01:03:03,121
the gifts for the King was
actually Royal Noble Consort Eui.

876
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:07,161
Or is she simply caught in
the trap set up by the Queen?

877
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,031
Before she could even spread her wings?

878
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:15,931
Your Highness.

879
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:18,496
Royal Noble Consort Eui is
at Tongmyeongjeon Hall now.

880
01:03:37,557 --> 01:03:40,292
I will protect you, Your Majesty.

881
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:48,232
She came of her own accord.

882
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:53,172
I suppose she was a lot closer
to O Wol than we had thought.

883
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:56,112
I am glad. This is easier than we thought.

884
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:57,622
Since she came of her own accord,

885
01:03:57,646 --> 01:03:59,911
you should make her
confess to it voluntarily.

886
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:02,851
Health comes first,

887
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:04,863
so I shall finish this
meal before I do that.

888
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:06,621
You are absolutely right.

889
01:04:57,637 --> 01:04:59,031
This is wrong.

890
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:03,772
Lady Hwa Jin would never do such a thing.

891
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:09,511
You cannot change the truth by killing me.

892
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:18,451
You poor thing.

893
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:21,673
You are like a loyal
dog licking the hand...

894
01:05:21,697 --> 01:05:24,331
of its master holding a sword to kill it.

895
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:28,261
Even if you confess to it,
it is too late now.

896
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,971
Your master, Lady Hwa Jin,
has dumped it all on you.

897
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:37,511
No, that cannot be...

898
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:46,351
There.

899
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:48,951
My gosh, you're good.

900
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:51,221
There.

901
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:02,142
- Darn it.
- That thread is highly valuable.

902
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,113
Gosh, this is the problem with rare,
valuable stuff.

903
01:06:04,137 --> 01:06:05,772
They're too weak.

904
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:07,672
Let's see.

905
01:06:08,146 --> 01:06:10,911
Let's find something sturdier and stronger.

906
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:21,922
"Desert your false self"?

907
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:24,433
"Desert your false self"?

908
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:25,573
What is this?

909
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:29,022
You used to embroider those letters
whenever you had a moment to spare.

910
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,542
I do not understand what
they mean for I cannot read,

911
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:33,502
but I am certain it is a beautiful poem.

912
01:06:33,767 --> 01:06:35,831
I have never seen it before.

913
01:06:36,276 --> 01:06:39,842
For some reason, she worked on
other embroideries whenever you came.

914
01:06:41,046 --> 01:06:42,752
It must be a poem about love, right?

915
01:06:42,776 --> 01:06:45,982
This must be a will.

916
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:49,662
I embroidered these letters
before I fell into the lake?

917
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:52,033
Is that what you're saying?

918
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:53,102
Yes, Your Highness.

919
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:54,363
Didn't I also...

920
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:56,851
have trouble falling asleep
and lose my appetite?

921
01:06:56,927 --> 01:06:59,372
Yes, you did. And you kept sighing nonstop.

922
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:01,292
And I always looked downcast.

923
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:03,431
On some days,
you broke into tears for no reason.

924
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:08,002
Your Highness,
you must have regained your memory!

925
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:09,402
No.

926
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:13,442
Did I give things I used to
treasure to others for no reason?

927
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:18,492
You gave me this...

928
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:20,156
although you used to treasure it so much.

929
01:07:20,217 --> 01:07:21,411
And...

930
01:07:21,686 --> 01:07:24,012
you gave a ring to Court Lady Choi.

931
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:28,552
Jo Hwa Jin was wrong.

932
01:07:28,986 --> 01:07:31,922
Kim So Yong wasn't trying to trap her.

933
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:33,947
She wanted to take her own life.

934
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:38,462
Isn't that Cheoljong?

935
01:07:38,566 --> 01:07:40,661
- Greet His Majesty! - Goodness.

936
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:43,031
Didn't he say a king should never run?

937
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:46,271
Gosh, seeing that face is making
my blood pressure rise again.

938
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:49,472
What?

939
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:51,411
Do you want to fight?

940
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:54,241
Hey, do you want a showdown?

941
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:58,382
Is this it? Is this your choice?

942
01:07:59,186 --> 01:08:00,462
What is this about?

943
01:08:00,486 --> 01:08:02,722
Are you playing dumb again?

944
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:06,792
Was I fooled by your
deceitful eyes and lies?

945
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:11,031
You're the one who's been
deceiving me all this time.

946
01:08:12,236 --> 01:08:13,912
I had no idea you were the
one who'd tried to kill me...

947
01:08:13,936 --> 01:08:15,343
and even slept in the same room as you.

948
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,571
So aren't I the one who
should be angry now?

949
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:19,201
You said yourself...

950
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:23,771
that only a coward targets
the one who is the weakest.

951
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:26,767
If you are trying to get back at me...

952
01:08:27,547 --> 01:08:30,252
in the same manner,

953
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:33,981
I will not sit back and
let you have your way.

954
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:42,691
What's he talking about?

955
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,081
What?

956
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:16,932
What should I do...

957
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:20,802
with this foolish weakling?

958
01:09:43,827 --> 01:09:45,252
Grand Queen Dowager.

959
01:09:45,797 --> 01:09:47,242
If you wish to hold someone
accountable for what happened,

960
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,821
let me be the one.

961
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:53,361
Care to elaborate? Who
am I holding accountable?

962
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:58,371
My court maid, O Wol, is missing.

963
01:09:58,877 --> 01:10:00,277
And I have something to do with it?

964
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:02,441
Why do you think so?

965
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:04,672
Because there is
something you need to hear.

966
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:10,951
I will say what you wish to hear.

967
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:15,151
Let us hear it, then.

968
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:19,562
The moment the Queen fell into the lake,

969
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:21,792
I was with her.

970
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:25,691
I swear...

971
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:29,361
you will also lose someone dear to you.

972
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:50,491
My emotions got the better of me,

973
01:10:52,867 --> 01:10:55,387
and I pushed the Queen into the
lake on the spur of the moment.

974
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:07,322
So please allow me to take sole
responsibility for what happened.

975
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,342
Please do not harm those
who did nothing wrong.

976
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:16,081
I will gladly accept any
punishment for what I did.

977
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,481
Is that so?

978
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:28,991
You must be well aware
of what this letter is about.

979
01:11:30,297 --> 01:11:33,102
You received this letter
from the Queen Dowager.

980
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:37,371
O Wol gave us this letter.

981
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:41,502
The location, date,
and time written in this letter...

982
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:44,712
coincide with when and where
the Queen's accident took place.

983
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:47,781
What do you think that means?

984
01:11:48,186 --> 01:11:51,812
I never received such a letter.

985
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:57,991
Did you think you would be
able to cover it up on your own?

986
01:11:59,497 --> 01:12:02,161
I suppose you think
very highly of yourself.

987
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:05,691
You know, you are a mere tail.

988
01:12:10,276 --> 01:12:12,132
Grand Queen Dowager.

989
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:15,972
I can assure you that letter is fake.

990
01:12:16,146 --> 01:12:17,672
I am sure it is not.

991
01:12:18,077 --> 01:12:19,962
Since they are from the same Jo family,

992
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:22,962
the two of them obviously
share the same goal.

993
01:12:22,986 --> 01:12:26,763
The Queen Dowager would
never join hands with anyone...

994
01:12:26,787 --> 01:12:30,422
on such a heinous act even
if they are from her family.

995
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:36,262
Then who fabricated this fake letter?

996
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:43,031
I suppose you needed someone...

997
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:45,672
to back up your plan.

998
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:53,281
Greet His Majesty!

999
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:56,981
Your Majesty.

1000
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:00,202
Grand Queen Dowager.

1001
01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:02,722
You are here. This is good.

1002
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:05,321
Royal Noble Consort Eui
has confessed to what she did.

1003
01:13:05,997 --> 01:13:08,661
She said that she pushed the
Queen into the lake to harm her.

1004
01:13:11,066 --> 01:13:12,983
That is not true.

1005
01:13:13,007 --> 01:13:15,632
Your Majesty, come to your senses!

1006
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:20,322
I understand that you are
head over heels for this woman,

1007
01:13:20,346 --> 01:13:23,152
but I cannot let you be in
charge of the royal court,

1008
01:13:23,176 --> 01:13:25,111
knowing how clouded your judgment is!

1009
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:29,581
Are you trying to protect
that ruthless criminal?

1010
01:13:30,016 --> 01:13:32,812
She tried to harm the Queen, your wife.

1011
01:13:34,386 --> 01:13:36,281
You tell him.

1012
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:39,392
Who tried to harm the Queen?

1013
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:52,531
It was me.

1014
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:54,071
Hwa Jin.

1015
01:13:58,316 --> 01:13:59,571
Did you hear that, right?

1016
01:14:03,217 --> 01:14:06,281
If you wish to insist that she
is simply trying to take the fall,

1017
01:14:06,486 --> 01:14:09,321
I will give you a chance to prove it.

1018
01:14:11,356 --> 01:14:12,752
You may enter now!

1019
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:43,352
Now that we have her confession,
what should we do with her?

1020
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,661
We will need her as a witness,
so treat her.

1021
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:51,792
What is this about?

1022
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:13,781
Get them!

1023
01:15:35,947 --> 01:15:38,752
If you admit to it right here before me...

1024
01:15:38,776 --> 01:15:40,382
and agree to be beheaded,

1025
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:44,012
I will not doubt you.

1026
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:56,273
Cheoljong said he sees himself...

1027
01:15:56,297 --> 01:15:57,991
being beheaded every night in his dream.

1028
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:00,802
He's totally frozen now.

1029
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:02,901
They're doomed.

1030
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,151
I will tell you the truth.

1031
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:24,422
Grand Queen Dowager,
I will obey your order!

1032
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:28,222
She is not the one who should be beheaded!

1033
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:36,302
Your Majesty.

1034
01:16:38,736 --> 01:16:39,901
Please.

1035
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:48,981
Will you go against the King's order?

1036
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:25,312
Cheoljong, that punk.

1037
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:27,722
He's pretty cool.

1038
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:33,962
Why is he acting all cool and tough?

1039
01:17:38,096 --> 01:17:39,231
Hold on.

1040
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:41,932
The lake will fill up tonight,

1041
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:43,602
which means I can go back.

1042
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:46,701
Those who tried to harm the Queen were...

1043
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:48,472
Wait!

1044
01:18:10,037 --> 01:18:11,731
- My goodness. - Oh, no!

1045
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:14,843
What is the matter?

1046
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:17,172
The water is gone.

1047
01:18:17,707 --> 01:18:18,831
What?

1048
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:22,901
Darn it.

1049
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:25,093
We have been using so much water...

1050
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,042
that the well has dried up.

1051
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:29,941
Oh, dear.

1052
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:33,852
I'm so dead.

1053
01:19:03,957 --> 01:19:06,063
Since I am the alleged
victim of this incident,

1054
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:07,922
allow me to shed light on the truth.

1055
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:15,321
I...

1056
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:21,901
was trying to take my own life.

1057
01:19:26,176 --> 01:19:28,472
I won't let you be the only cool one here.

1058
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,741
I should be the hero.

1059
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,451
I'm going back, so it doesn't matter.

1060
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:46,621
So please do not hurt
those who did nothing wrong.

1061
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:53,731
Nice one.

1062
01:20:12,556 --> 01:20:13,563
(Mr. Queen)

1063
01:20:13,587 --> 01:20:14,803
(This drama is fictional
and all characters, families, )

1064
01:20:14,827 --> 01:20:17,187
(dynasties, and events are
unrelated to historical events.)

1065
01:20:32,606 --> 01:20:35,152
Prince Yeongpyeong raided
the place with assassins.

1066
01:20:35,176 --> 01:20:37,053
It seemed like they'd
received special training.

1067
01:20:37,077 --> 01:20:39,652
If a problem arises,
you can just cut it out.

1068
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:42,063
The well has dried up.

1069
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,593
I believed...

1070
01:20:43,617 --> 01:20:45,832
that I had to give up on
you to make you happy.

1071
01:20:45,856 --> 01:20:47,502
That arrogant glare.

1072
01:20:47,526 --> 01:20:49,502
How dare he?

1073
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:51,933
The Queen's condition
is worsening by the day.

1074
01:20:51,957 --> 01:20:53,572
Wouldn't it be right to...

1075
01:20:53,596 --> 01:20:55,116
petition the King to depose the Queen?

1076
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:58,592
Now, everything will go
back to where it should be.

1077
