2
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,060
   
    

3
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,130
   

4
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,510
Oh no, oh no!

5
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,170
   

6
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,580
   (A child's practice book) 

7
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,210
Do you know what this is that's considered so precious?

8
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,200
Why is this children's book precious to you?

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,780
- Oh thatâ€” 
 - Was it you, My Queen?

10
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,670
Were you the one who saved me?

11
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,860
Did you save me from the well?

12
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,090
That's right. It was me.

13
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,600
Did you forget already? After I went through all that carrying you around?

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,470
These handsome arms still have muscle aches that I got at that time.

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,330
Wow, I can't believe you already forgot all about it.

16
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,020
I'm talking about what happened eight years ago.

17
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,720
That wasn't your first time falling in a disused well?

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,950
What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,680
Then, why is this book important to you?

20
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,950
At a glance, it looks like it would be presented on the TV show, "Genuine Articles and Masterpieces."

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,890
You're saying weird things again.

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,780
After I dreamed of being trapped in the well, I thought of you.

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,620
Maybe it's because you saved me from the well,

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,880
but I keep confusing you with the child who saved me from the well eight years ago.

25
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,300
I keep thinking that perhaps you might have been that childâ€”

26
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh, this doesn't taste good when it's soggy.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,340
Do you want some?

28
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,220
Please eat up.

29
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,520
Oh dear...

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,860
   

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,440
Blow on it and eat slowly.

32
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,280
What are you reading?

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,550
It's a book on strategy, written in the Ming era.

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,800
If you say, a book on strategy...

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,990
The military?

36
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,780
Are you going to war?

37
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,670
To strengthen my royal authority, a strong military power must back it up.

38
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,360
Do you still have nightmares of dying as an incompetent king?

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
From time to time.

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,160
Even if that really happens,

41
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,080
it's not because you're lacking.

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,530
It's just how the massive flow of history is.

43
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,370
You just happened to be standing in the flow already running in the direction of ruin, that's all.

44
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,910
So it's not your fault.

45
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,260
That could be the case.

46
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,410
So don't try so hard or be miserable.

47
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,320
If it's fate, then you can't stop it anyway.

48
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,030
After I wake up from my nightmares, I sometimes get this weird feeling

49
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,160
that my dream is actually the present and the present is the past.

50
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,560
In that last moment of my life as an incompetent king  is ending,

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm dreaming...

52
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,460
of the moment when I still have a chance,

53
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,900
when I can still... prevent things.  Dreaming of the present...

54
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,060
Maybe right now I'm

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,650
just doing this to fight my fate.

56
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,450
 I suddenly want to risk everything for this man who will obviously lose.  

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,750
   

58
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,150
You will end up... winning that fight.

59
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,800
My side is always the winning side.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,780
Since I'm on your side now, you're destined to win.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,430
That confidence of yours is very reliable.

62
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,320
I have a secret weapon.

63
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,500
I know the future.

64
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,200
Do you remember when I told you I was a man who came from the future, 200 years from now?

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,100
I remember that ridiculous statement, yes.

66
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,600
What if what I told you was true?

67
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,140
So what if I can teach you using knowledge from the future?

68
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,610
Are you telling me to really believe that?

69
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,160
If it's so hard to believe, just think I simply had a dream.

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,750
A very vivid dream about the future.

71
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,700
If that's the case, I won't exactly believe those ridiculous words,

72
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,320
but I'll listen to them.

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,300
How is Joseon 200 years from now?

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Okay, then.

75
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,060
Let's just say I'm making this up, but

76
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,280
we no longer call it Joseon.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,960
The Republic of Korea. That's Joseon's future.

78
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,020
- The Republic of Korea? 
 - In the Republic of Korea, the citizens pick the king themselves.

79
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,100
What kind of nonsenseâ€”

80
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,270
Shouldn't you tell me something more believable so that I can be fooled or not?

81
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,730
You can't be shocked already.

82
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,650
The nonsense starts now.

83
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,340
Two hundred years from now, there will be neither nobles nor commoners.

84
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,350
Are you saying the class system will disappear?

85
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,020
Of course, something else exists instead.

86
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,540
Dirt spoons and gold spoons.

87
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,500
To think they use spoons instead of hopae to confirm their identity...   (ID system using badges with status / household info ) 

88
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,680
Then when the citizens choose their king, do they take spoons with them?

89
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,820
There's this thing called voting.

90
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,800
Once you turn 18, you legally receive the right to choose a king.

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,050
- Choosing a king? 
 - That's right.

92
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,550
 At the age of 18? 

93
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,690
Like that, the queen has stirred up the entire palace all day long.

94
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,110
Good work.

95
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,670
From now on, your job is to watch the queen's actions and movements every day.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,100
Brother, as you became the youngest Minister of Military ever,

97
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,310
you've become masterly.

98
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,900
- Is that all? 
 - Of course not.

99
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,030
Figured as much.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,380
Congratulations.

101
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,750
By the way,

102
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,450
can our family and the king really not live on good terms?

103
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,980
The king cares for the queen very much, too.

104
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,930
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

105
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,440
The king does not sincerely cherish the queen.

106
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,710
For his own gain, he always puts the queen in a deadly situation.

107
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,550
But he doesn't seem like that.

108
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,630
That's what I hate the most.

109
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,160
He hides behind a mask and his woman.

110
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,210
Like so, he hides his true self and fools people with his two faces.

111
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,280
The queen is being fooled by that face

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,930
and supports the king, even by turning her back on our own family.

113
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,150
The king is only using the queen's feelings.

114
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,080
From what I heard, it's actually the king that's fallen head over heels for the queen.

115
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,300
Regarding the king's love life,

116
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,250
the rumors among the palace maids are always the most accurate ones, you know.

117
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,030
Even last night, they were talking for so long,

118
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,910
the lights in Huijeongjeon burned all night long, from what I heard.  (King's bed-chamber and office) 

119
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,420
 If Cheoljong succeeds, I guess the world of 200 years later would change, too. Right? 

120
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
 If history changes, then the Japanese colonial period will not happen either.  

121
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,660
 And deep-rooted corrupt people like Director Han won't exist either. 

122
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,130
 I'm not helping because of Cheoljong. 

123
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,650
 This is solely for myself. 

124
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,060
Saving you...

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,820
is also saving myself.

126
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,420
Your Majesty!

127
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,970
Your Majesty, your father has collapsed.

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,640
Don't get up, don't get up.

129
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,040
- What happened? 
 - It's dangerous.

130
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Why did you come all the way here?

131
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,640
No. The palace is more dangerous.

132
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,370
Your Majesty, stay here from now on.

133
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,830
I will do my best to keep you safe.

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,110
I see... You collapsed because of what happened to me.

135
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,330
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

136
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,200
It's as if I served the poison to Your Majesty with my own hands.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,530
I uselessly made something that I wasn't able to protect.

138
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,300
They were the ones who did wrong.

139
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,960
It's not your fault, Father, so don't blame yourself and get some rest.

140
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,250
Think only about your health.

141
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,160
I am all right.

142
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,460
As long as you're happy, I'm all right.

143
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,330
So, Your Majesty,

144
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,140
please step down from your position.

145
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,650
- Father. 
 - So-yong,

146
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,820
when your mother was pregnant with you, there's something she always said.

147
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,560
She said, "This child will live the nice life I can't."

148
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,790
That her child would do everything she was unable to do,

149
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,570
hoping that you would live a better life than her.

150
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,700
That was your mother's last dream.

151
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,100
Now I don't know how I will look into your mother's face on the other side.

152
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,760
Father, from now on, I'm going to live as Mother wanted.

153
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,840
I plan on returning the favor to those that did this to me.

154
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,310
- Your Majesty. 
 - So, Father, you can't become weak like this.

155
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,100
There's something I need you to do.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,190
Yes. I'll do anything you need me to.

157
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,440
I will do anything.

158
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,930
     
 (T/N: Modern Korean catchphrases.) 

159
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,390
 Whoa, this is awesome! 

160
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,240
He's an infamous miser, what's going on?

161
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,840
What if he forces us to pay back double-fold later?

162
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,410
I thank you!

163
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,540
Your Lordship, as well as Her Majesty the Queen, will live a long and healthy life!

164
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,330
A  whole sack of rice!

165
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,070
Are they crazy?

166
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,000
How... beautifully crazy they are!

167
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,650
 I need you to do something for me. 

168
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,910
 Please take your hands off of any corruption.  

169
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,860
 And now you will have to build a good reputation.  

170
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,050
Are you really not going to sell all this but give it away?

171
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,940
Of course. It's not like I can take these things with me to the afterlife.

172
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,300
You need to let go so that I can take it.

173
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,690
Well, since earthly desires are like habits...

174
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,680
Your father has made a big decision.

175
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,850
That's not all.

176
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,010
This is the ledger you've been looking for.

177
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,350
My father remembers everything in the book.

178
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,540
 (List of names and their corrupt account in detail) 

179
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,610
They're much trashier than I thought.

180
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,840
The Left State Minister played a lot of tricks with the government loan for the poor.

181
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,610
 He has siphoned it in very varied ways, but the scale is tremendous.  

182
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,030
The Prime Minister's specialty is playing with land.

183
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,130
 For example, he forced the farmers to cultivate a rocky mountain and harvest from it,  

184
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,550
 then he charged them a huge tax.  

185
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,850
 There is no one who didn't pocket and nothing they didn't pocket.  

186
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,520
Not to mention, military corruption and the selling of official posts,

187
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,370
there is even a case where they sank a boat full of stone, instead of salt,

188
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,090
and just pocketed that huge amount of salt!

189
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,230
In such ways, they've committed all sorts of fraud with taxes and products submitted to the king.

190
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,010
Among them, what made me most pissed off was the evil loan sharking.

191
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,850
After charging farmers a huge tax, they'd give them a loan with 50% interest.

192
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,930
So every time the people breathed in, they're being crushed under by debt.

193
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,700
This is almost like gangsters' work.

194
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,570
Your father's memory concerning wealth is really amazing.

195
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,830
Well, then,

196
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,320
how will you treat a whistle-blower?

197
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
Your father was at the core of all this corruption.

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,480
His sin won't disappear even with this information.

199
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,560
Butâ€”

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,530
What do you mean "but" when he's just the queen's father who is also one of those corrupt people!

201
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,040
However, he is your only blood family left.

202
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,720
How about this?

203
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,650
They say, after calculating the merits and faults, if merits are bigger than faults, one's faults will be forgiven.

204
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,960
So, he should accomplish more merits?  Give me some examples.

205
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,170
For example, he could cooperate to collect more evidence.

206
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,990
Because it'll be hard to punish those people with only that list.

207
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,330
In return, you will guarantee the whistle-blower's safety for sure.

208
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,750
Of course.

209
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,220
Your Majesty, it's time for you to go to the council meeting.

210
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,160
All right.

211
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,300
The council meeting...

212
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,770
 To incinerate garbage, I should go to the dumping ground.  

213
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:56,080
 But unless it's as regent, they don't let women attend the royal council meetings, though. 

214
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,990
For Director of Office of Correction for the Three Taxes, I'm appointing my brother, Prince Yeongpyeong.

215
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,920
 - That can't be done, Your Majesty! 
 - That can't be done, Your Majesty! 

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,230
Why not?

217
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,020
To let an inexperienced Prince Yeongpyeong take that post,

218
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,110
its responsibility and workload would be too severe.

219
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,400
Ideally, he isn't partial to any families either.

220
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,150
That's precisely the biggest qualification for taking that office.

221
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,830
Moreover,

222
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,360
now, do I look like I'm asking your permission?

223
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,350
   

224
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,660
 Oh, Cheoljong! 

225
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,350
I've dispatched a secret Royal Inspector to the Yeongnam area, where the situation is the most serious.  (Gyeongsang Province) 

226
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,670
All crimes of exploitation will be punished according to the law,

227
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,410
and any wealth made from that exploitation will be

228
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,140
used as a relief fund for people.

229
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,870
In that way, we will use it as an example to all local government officials in the eight provinces

230
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,070
and make them turn themselves in.

231
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,510
 - That can't be done, Your Majesty! 
 - That can't be done, Your Majesty! 

232
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,530
The Ministry of the Military has already dispatched their officers and soldiers.

233
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,050
They dispatched troops without reporting to me?

234
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,960
Recently, the vicious commotion made by the Thieves of Donghak  (Eastern Learning / Neo-Confucian Reform) 

235
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,420
is similar to the Northwest Rebellion which threatened Joseon in the past.

236
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,850
Therefore, as this is a crisis that we must urgently deal withâ€”

237
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,950
I bet the Border Defense Council has decided to do as they please!

238
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,330
The Thieves of Donghak have created a disturbance, threatened government officials,

239
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,740
and harmed government clerks.

240
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,230
Therefore, we'll immediately arrest the leaders of the Thieves of Donghak and behead them.

241
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,730
We'll make sure such incidents will never happen again. We have to eradicate them.

242
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,360
Eradicate them?

243
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,690
Not only the people who teach Eastern learning but also the people who learn it.

244
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,950
We'll arrest all of them, charge them, and mete out severe punishments.

245
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,480
Right now, the root of the problems that Joseon is facing are those people who frequently exploit others!

246
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,120
To eradicate the real root of the problem, the Office of Correction for the Three Taxes is trying to investigate the details and relieve the people!

247
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,800
As you're just sitting on the throne, Your Majesty, you don't know the nature of the crowds.

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,380
If you start to listen to their demands, there will be no end to it.

249
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,510
We should suppress them with a strong force,

250
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,350
so that they won't be able to uprise ever again.

251
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,960
 - That's right, Your Majesty! 
 - That's right, Your Majesty! 

252
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,770
As to whether there are any innocent people among the incarcerated, I'll review them again.

253
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,330
Also, those people who exploit others will be  severely punished as an example,

254
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,910
and I'll order that both provincial and military governors in charge of those problematic districts to be beheaded as well.

255
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,150
Calming the unrest of those Thieves of Donghak with the relief fund...

256
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,170
How ignorant of the matter he is.

257
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,940
Before the force of the rebellion gets bigger,

258
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,960
I'll dispatch more troops and suppress those Thieves of Donghak.

259
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,730
What are you doing?

260
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,700
Before the face gets dried, you should apply the toner.

261
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,570
Your Highness, the thing is... We just ran out of it.

262
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,330
Shall I ask Her Majesty the Queen to bring a new tonerâ€”

263
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,500
I shouldn't, no, of course not.

264
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,290
- You may leave! 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,430
Can you really not forgive the queen?

266
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,540
If you read those letters she exchanged with the king, you wouldn't be able to say that.

267
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,010
This isn't a matter of forgiveness.

268
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,530
What a childish love game it was...

269
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,040
It seemed that she might even give up her own life for him!

270
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,180
Is this the cost for being loyal to your family?

271
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,480
Placing all the blame on us, banishing and branding our family as treasonous so that our future is now blocked!

272
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,670
How could you dump us like worn-out shoes?

273
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,760
You better think what a relief it is that your family didn't get annihilated.

274
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,120
At least, you saved your own life.

275
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,880
Follow me to work at the palace.

276
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,810
I'll prove to you that I'm different from my father.

277
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,320
Indeed, drinking in daylight is the best way to drink alcohol!

278
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,010
Of course, drinking in daylight is the best.

279
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,400
Oh, this is shrimp.  What a rare food it is.

280
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,260
- What are you? 
 - What are you then?

281
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,470
- Sitting like this in this current situation. 
 - What?

282
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,590
Where do you think you are, daring to behave like this! What on earth are you, scoundrel?

283
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,310
Oh... here.  I'm a Secret Royal Inspector.

284
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,750
Oh... the right way.

285
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,960
They said there were too many fake secret royal inspectors lately.  Don't you dare to deceive me!

286
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,050
Well, these days the effectiveness of the "mapae"  (badge)  isn't the same as before anymore. 
  (T/N: 3-5 horses, on badge is the rank of royal inspector) 

287
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,000
So here comes the Secret Royal Inspector.

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,460
S-Spare me, please.

289
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,800
Here we're entering the era when a rifle works better than a mapae.

290
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,220
Gosh, we're not even women, what's with this tea time?

291
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,390
Why do you think she summoned us?

292
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:51,660
The king with a hard-line policy, and the queen with a conciliatory policy, maybe it's something like that.

293
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,960
She's probably trying to show that she's from our family, but that's absurd.

294
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,580
Well, let's go and play along with her tune for a bit.

295
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,660
- Let's do that. 
 - Let's go.

296
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,760
It has been quite a while since I became queen,

297
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,760
but I haven't properly treated you, the elders of our family yet.

298
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,980
It's all because there were so many incidents these days.  Please accept my apology.

299
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,640
Although this isn't much, please enjoy what I've prepared.

300
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,750
- This is not tea... but alcohol? 
 - Shush!

301
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,580
Please pretend you're drinking tea. His Majesty the King has decreed a reduction in the number of dishes and forbid alcohol,

302
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,590
but how could these ministers drink alcohol in daylight hours like this?  What if you get caught?

303
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,600
But you deceived us, Your Majesty!

304
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Did you just set a trap here?

305
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,330
- How could she... 
 - This is ridiculous...

306
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,900
Stop being so annoying. It's annoying.

307
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,120
But you were annoying firsâ€”

308
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,940
What do you take us for that you're doing this?

309
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,450
I know exactly the kind of people you are.

310
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,080
That you are cancerous beings in this period of time.

311
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,210
C-Can... Cancerous... 
  (T/N: Cancer is a modern term. Ancient era - they used 'ongjer') 

312
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,020
- In your terms, you guys are the plague of this era. 
 - W-What...

313
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,380
Why are we here listening to this? Let's leave!

314
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,350
Why on earth are you doing this to us?

315
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,140
Good question. That was a good question.

316
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,750
As expected from the prime minister, you speak some useful words, unlike the others.

317
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,740
Why am I being like this?

318
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,690
I'm doing this to tell you to not block the king's path.

319
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,820
Going forward, every time when you shout in unison, "That can't be done," in front of His Majesty,

320
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,080
starting from the tail, one by one,

321
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,620
one after another,

322
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,800
please be aware that you will disappear.

323
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,090
From now on, if you don't want to see that no one remains from the Ansong Family during council meetings,

324
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,150
I'm telling you, you'd better spare yourselves a bit.

325
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,750
You are also a part of the Ansong Kim clan!

326
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,540
That's why I'm changing my surname!  From now on, I'm not Kim So-yong, but Jang So-yong.

327
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,130
W-What?

328
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,430
I guess your brains are that dumb because you got to that position due to your clan's influence.

329
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,580
All of you, please write these down.

330
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,490
From now on, forbidden to say, "That can't be done."

331
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,950
Forbidden to submit appeals, forbidden to conspire schemes,

332
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,260
forbidden to go to Oktajeong. 
  (The gisaeng house) 

333
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,600
W-Why is O-Oktajeong forbidden?

334
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,790
Because I can't go.

335
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,130
I saw that the Grand Pardons were processed successfully.

336
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,710
Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager has great discerning eyes to see good talent.

337
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,750
Today, I came here to ask you a favor.

338
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,690
Since you've joined hands with our clan, I would appreciate it if you

339
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,230
would stop doing things to harm the queen, who is from our clan.

340
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,270
Our enemy is the king.

341
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,790
We shouldn't aim swords at each other's throats to help our common enemy, don't you think?

342
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:45,530
Of course not. It has already been a long time since I quit all shamanistic rites and posted talismans.

343
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,800
Your Royal Highness.

344
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,980
There's something to report.

345
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,760
That's right. To know the language of an era, I should read the books from that era.

346
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,920
Ah, it's so awkward explaining my words nicely.

347
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,360
What should I read to know newly-made words in this Joseon era?

348
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,870
Such things are not in this library here at the palace.

349
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,090
Then?

350
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,800
It's better to buy an eonmun novel, which is sold at general stores outside of the palace.  (Korean stories written in dialect) 

351
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,900
Oh, I see. What kind of content is it?

352
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,100
I've only heard of them.

353
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,740
I wasn't allowed to read them.

354
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,560
I know a few.

355
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,000
There is a story about a good wife who died after being abandoned by her husband,

356
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,200
but her soul came back with a mole next to her lips and took revenge.

357
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,090
Th-That story sounds familiar. What's the title?

358
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,820
Temptation of Woman. 
   (T/N: Parody of TV drama, "Temptation of Wife") 

359
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,060
I thought you didn't read it.

360
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,670
Only the title. I only know the title.

361
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,830
And? Is there anything else?

362
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,650
This is a recent one. It's a story about one lady from a noble family.

363
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,600
Her husband, the lord, had an affair with a so much younger miss from the house next to themâ€”

364
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,300
The World of The Marital Classification! 
  (T/N: Parody of TV drama, "The World of The Married") 

365
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,020
Court Lady Choi, you said you didn't read it. Why are you so angry?

366
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,410
I apologize.

367
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,390
I see everyone thinks alike.

368
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,470
Why did you do it?

369
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,550
Leave us.

370
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,780
Yes.

371
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,050
Your Majesty, for your safety, you need the power from our clan.

372
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,370
Why did you make them your enemy?

373
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,300
It seems like you've forgotten but those oldies tried to kill me.

374
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,320
I've been making a way for you to return to your original place.

375
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,820
I don't want to return.

376
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,340
While I was here, I did all sorts of things to get on the Grand Queen Dowager's good side.

377
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,860
I didn't even work this hard when I was at the Blue House.

378
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,500
But you know what I received in return? Poison in ice.

379
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,430
That was because of the Jo family, which tried to get between you and the family.

380
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,260
I said I would protect you.

381
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,930
Let me make things clear.

382
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,990
Since dragging this out won't be good.

383
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,690
I can't have the same mind as you and I don't intend on using your feelings.

384
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,470
Already...

385
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,870
My path is different than yours.

386
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,640
It's best for both of us to go our own ways.

387
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,620
Your Majesty, I am your person!

388
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,320
Why is it the king out of all people?

389
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,920
If it weren't for the king, I could do anything you want me to, but why him?

390
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,890
Even if it weren't for the king,

391
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,820
you still wouldn't be it.

392
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,090
Don't let go of my hand, So-yong.

393
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,590
You're my everything.

394
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:52,300
  Translation and Timing Carefully Crafted 
 by The Royal Team ðŸ‘‘  at Viki.com  

395
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,270
The Royal Portrait must portray His Majesty exactly, even a single hair of his.

396
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,560
Not only His Majesty's appearance but his inner nature must be included, too.

397
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,710
And you must not use your own painting style either.

398
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,140
My Queen.

399
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,170
Do you have any worries now?

400
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,260
Well, nothing much.

401
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,970
It just doesn't feel so great.

402
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,590
My Queen...

403
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,240
What are you doing?

404
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:46,750
If I use my face widely, my voice sounds like a king, but if I use my face narrowly, my voice sounds like a eunuch.

405
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,920
Is it not funny?

406
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,450
It's really not easy to make you laugh.  If that's the case...

407
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:04,820
If I use my body in a small way, a servant's voice, but if I use my body in a big way, a strong man's voice comes out!

408
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,100
Is it not funny?

409
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,160
You finally laughed!

410
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,060
Your Majesty, please be in the position again.

411
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,870
I'll do it again later.

412
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,990
By the way, why, all of sudden, a portrait?

413
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,120
According to the rule of "Jo for merit and Jong for virtue,"

414
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,490
I've decided to promote the name of King Sunjong to King Sunjo.

415
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,080
So accordingly, my status is also elevated, so this is to commemorate it.  (T/N: Cheoljong was an  adopted son.) 

416
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,920
"Jo for merit and Jong for virtue..." Ah, I've heard of it once, for sure.

417
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,290
When a king's posthumous name is decided upon,

418
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,240
for a king who accomplished merits, "Jo" is used,

419
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,410
and for a king who is with virtue, "Jong" is used. 
 (T/N: The "jong" in Sujong was not bestowed ) 

420
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,480
Ah, now I remember.

421
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,630
Your Majesty, this is the thing you've mentioned.

422
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,900
Let me see.

423
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,620
Whoa...

424
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,050
Wow, this product came out nicely.

425
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,190
Are you trying to learn swordsmanship?

426
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,270
With swords, I'm pretty good.

427
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,590
I don't have to learn swordsmanship separately,

428
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,070
because I'm already great at using knives.

429
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,710
This is a gift to be presented to a valuable person.

430
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,490
A valuable person...

431
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,930
Is it now my turn?

432
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,440
You must have been waiting!  Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,880
I wasn't so sure if I have to really deal with someone who is now pushed backstage.

434
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
How interesting.

435
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,620
You suggested forming an alliance with me, then you suddenly resigned without saying goodbye.

436
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,840
You failed to control your husband.

437
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,640
That's why you didn't guarantee my safety?

438
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,520
I had a plan, you know, before you messed with me.

439
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,300
What kind of plan was it?

440
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,610
A plan to live a safe and boring life.

441
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,450
Please unsheathe the sword.

442
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,190
I'm not fighting with a woman.

443
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,140
This is just a gift I've prepared, as I was sad to let you go without a proper retirement ceremony.

444
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,210
On the blade, all the accomplishments that Lord Kim Jwa-geun has achieved so far are engraved.

445
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,210
So please unsheathe it and take a look.

446
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,230
That is exactly your life so far, My Lord.

447
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:10,750
You asked about what I could possibly do as a woman, even if I were the queen. Right?

448
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,690
Please wait and watch what I can do.

449
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,660
From now on, I'll go with "no filter," "no brake," and "no back."

450
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,380
Your Majesty, Lady Eui Bin is here.

451
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,420
Let her come in.

452
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,240
How are you feeling?

453
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,060
Since I sorted out my troubled thoughts while shooting arrows, my mind is now at ease.

454
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,100
That's a relief.

455
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,140
You have done a lot of work until this late hour.

456
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,210
Not as many as you need to worry about, My Lady.

457
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,330
   

458
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,120
   

459
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,770
If I had known this would come to mean so much to Your Majesty,

460
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,470
I would've used it a bit more gently.

461
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,870
I put a lot of scribbles in here.

462
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,530
I must have taken too much of your time when you were busy.  I'll take my leave now.

463
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,920
My Lady.

464
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,900
There is something I haven't been able to say so far.

465
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:15,500
I didn't embrace you in my mind, just because you were the child I met in the well eight years ago.

466
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,950
You, whom I met again when I came back to Hanyang,

467
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,350
I liked you even then.

468
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,920
 Your Majesty, Prince Yeongpyeong is here. 

469
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,930
I see you are here, My Lady.

470
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,670
I was about to leave.

471
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,280
Please enjoy the conversation, you two.

472
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,430
What were you talking about so that she...

473
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,140
The truth that no one wants

474
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,660
is only right to be disregarded, I guess.

475
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,380
Look at those passionate eyes.

476
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,920
What a pervert for social science.

477
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,350
Gosh, you must have been thinking of getting my lesson all day long.

478
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:53,660
Well, I probably won't believe it, but let's hear your future story again today.

479
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,700
Today's topic is...

480
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,140
   

481
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,380
Constitutional monarchy.

482
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,570
Constitutional monarchy?

483
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,070
The king reigns but does not govern.

484
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,030
This is the way that there is a king, but the power is given back to the people.

485
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,910
There is a country called Bhutan.

486
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,930
That's a very unfamiliar name.

487
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,040
There is a king called Jigme Khesar, which is an even more unfamiliar name to you.

488
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,620
This king changed his country himself to a constitutional monarchy from an absolute monarchy like Joseon.

489
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,210
Why did he do that?

490
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,910
He did it since he was worried that some despot would become king in the future and ruin his country.

491
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,180
So, they make a constitution first and they rule according to the constitution.

492
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,710
The king is just a symbolic figure.

493
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,240
Jigme Khesar is a wise man.

494
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,000
Which "Ji" is he using for his name?

495
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,750
Hey, go home now.

496
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,860
Home? Where is that?

497
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,750
Gosh, this guy. You're really drunk.

498
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,690
You can't even remember where you live.

499
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:36,160
I must be off and head to my own home.

500
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,990
I don't have a home.

501
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,230
I don't have anything.

502
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,040
I have no place to go and I own nothing.

503
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,210
There's nothing for me now.

504
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,610
 I didn't embrace you in my mind, just because you were the child  

505
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,430
 that I had met in the well eight years ago.  

506
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,690
No. There's no way the king knows.

507
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,580
- Now is not a good time. 
 - I need to see the king now.

508
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:49,560
Butâ€”

509
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,970
Your Majesty, it's Hwa-jin.

510
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,430
So, with Her Majesty the Queen, who is half man and half woman here,

511
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,310
I shall complete the military strategy book?  Well, all right, sounds good.

512
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,430
Don't have a prejudice. The queen is designing new and groundbreaking weapons we've never heard of.

513
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,620
Well, let me hear it first, please?

514
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,120
Before that, I have some killing training routines for soldiers.

515
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,000
- Why don't I teach him that first? 
 - Oh!

516
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,730
Killing...

517
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,740
One, two, three, seven!

518
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,080
Your voice is too quiet.  Is that all you can do?

519
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,540
I understand it now, so let's discuss the weapons.

520
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,850
This is just number eight.  There are 14 routines in total.

521
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,330
For the last one, you're not counting out loud.

522
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,270
If you are, the routine will be restarted from the beginning.

523
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:33,790
One, two, three, six.

524
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,070
 - Your eyes must look up.   
 - One, two... 

525
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,890
It's dangerous to involve the queen in the work of the military strategy book as well.

526
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,720
The queen declared war against her own clan.

527
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,310
Is it necessary for her to prove that she's on our side anymore?

528
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,190
My Queen.

529
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,770
Lift your legs. One, two, three, eight,

530
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,050
Oh, eight is the last one.  From the beginning, again.

531
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,550
What?  You said it's a killing method, so will it end when I'm killed?

532
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,340
Start again from the beginning.

533
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,300
- Yes! 
 - Your Majesty, please...

534
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,130
 Because you don't even realize you're becoming a monster, 

535
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,610
 although you're becoming a monster little by little, every day. 

536
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,870
With this many forged records, it's enough to bring down the Left State Minister.

537
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,080
- Please go and arrest him. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,830
 Your Majesty, Lady Eui Bin is here. 

539
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,070
Let her in.

540
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,270
There's something I need to tell you.

541
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,620
Can you please excuse us, Prince Yeongpyeong?

542
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,690
- My Lady... 
 - Please.

543
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,110
It seems that you've been talking with the queen every night.

544
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,430
What do you talk about?

545
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,590
We talk about the Joseon that I dream of.

546
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,460
I thought I would be the one to share your dreams with you.

547
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,830
While the queen is doing that, I've been busy being thrown off by lies.

548
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,030
I will no longer be thrown off.

549
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,450
The owner of the children's book is not me.

550
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,570
You knew all along? Then, why didn't you say anything?

551
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,630
Because it doesn't change anything.

552
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,140
Why does it not change anything?

553
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,720
Your trust in me will no longer be in your heart.

554
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,410
Your eyes won't be the same as before when looking at me.

555
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,360
Just because of one lie,

556
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,530
doesn't mean the time I spent with you disappears.

557
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,610
The fact that we've shared our feelings for the past two years doesn't change.

558
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,660
You probably acted like you didn't know, for my sake.

559
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,390
Because that's the kind of person you are.

560
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,810
Did you think I would be happy if you acted like you didn't know, for my sake?

561
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,310
- Hwa-jin. 
- I plotted to entrap the queen.

562
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:58,440
I found the ledger in the queen's parental home and gave it to Queen Dowager Jo.

563
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,230
What... Howâ€”

564
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:07,070
I hate the queen.

565
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,280
Didn't you know what that ledger was when you saw it? That it was something I needed.

566
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,420
I knew that and still did it.

567
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,080
How could you do that to me?

568
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,550
You knew better than anyone what my dream was. To think that you stepped on my dream...

569
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,330
My dream... was you, Your Majesty!

570
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,050
But your heart started going toward the queen.

571
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,060
Seeing you try your best toward me,

572
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,620
while also being helplessly drawn to her,

573
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,890
made me feel more and more pathetic.

574
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,070
And I soon lost myself.

575
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,410
It's all my fault.

576
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,920
I made you like this.

577
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,280
It's my fault.

578
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,690
I shouldn't have had a love that was not for me.

579
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,740
I will find myself now, even if it's too late.

580
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,440
   

581
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,530
This rotten lord! Next one.

582
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,280
   

583
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,340
Your Majesty, aren't you going to go to Huijeongjeon tonight? 
  (King's bed-chamber and office.) 

584
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,880
Should I just skip today?

585
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,910
Ah, our Cheoljong must be waiting with a craned neck for me.

586
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,720
Who knew I also have such a "soul of a scholar" family.

587
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,000
Just one more page.

588
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,930
   

589
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:35,010
Jong, I'm sorry, sorry.  I was going to read just one more page, but couldn't stop reading page after page.

590
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,380
Why didn't you change yetâ€”

591
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,960
What? Why are you giving that to me?

592
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,970
Didn't you say to return it when I felt like living again?

593
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,150
Now I know that not knowing the truth itself

594
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,270
can hurt someone.

595
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,890
I took too long

596
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,660
returning this to its owner.

597
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,590
   

598
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,660
I'm sorry.

599
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,420
For not recognizing you.

600
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,730
Same to you. I wasn't honest with you for a long time.

601
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,000
   

602
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,890
It finally came back to its owner.

603
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:42,230
I may not be able to turn back the time we missed;

604
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:50,430
however, I will never again misunderstand or lose you again.

605
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,550
But what happened to you during those eight years?

606
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:06,110
Although you were a bit odd at that time, you weren't this bad.

607
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,030
Did I miss something?

608
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,240
That's what I'm saying.

609
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,390
Seems like you're enjoying that, though I'm not sure what it is.

610
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,040
It's medicine. Medicine.

611
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,380
Whatever you eat in hiding must be good.

612
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,120
Yogurt?

613
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,990
But this smells like alcohol!

614
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,500
It's called Yihwaju. 
  (Yogurt-like alcohol liked by noble ladies to hide their drinking) 

615
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,900
It's a liquor that we make in the season of pear blossoms,

616
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,320
and drink when the fragrance of the pear blossom floats subtly in the jar.

617
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,700
Give me some, too.

618
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,750
That was the last bite. This alcohol requires a lot of work

619
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,410
so I was saving it, but because of youâ€”

620
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,160
How do you make this?

621
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,040
All right! First, you add water to rice powder to make a dough.

622
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,580
You flatten the dough, make a hole in the middle, and let it rest.

623
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,980
It's shaped like a donut.

624
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,220
Continue.

625
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:26,410
 Anyway, after cooking them in boiling water, you break them into pieces and cool them down. 

626
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,300
 There is a yeast called Yihwagok.  Prepare this yeast in advance, so that you can put it in the dough and knead it again. 

627
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,130
Then you put it in an alcohol jar, close the lid,

628
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,560
and after three days?

629
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Then we drink?

630
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,870
Of course not.

631
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,200
Then we give it a good stir,

632
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,130
and after 20 days...

633
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,660
We eat it then.

634
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,880
Time needs to fly quickly. Ferment well.

635
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,090
Kim Seok-geun, Left State Minister, colluded with local government officials to exploit farmers

636
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,900
and used the reserved grains for your personal use.

637
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,000
For all these charges, you will be dismissed from your official position and your properties will be forfeited.

638
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,300
You will be exiled to an isolated island, surrounded by a thorn hedge.

639
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,630
How dare you!

640
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,600
Let go!

641
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,450
Let go of me!

642
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,620
I said let go!

643
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,020
What?  Let go!

644
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,820
Who knew that the queen's declaration of war was really true...

645
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,020
For the post of Left State Minister, which is now vacant, I'm appointing

646
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,680
Lord Min Wu-jin of the Yeoheung Min family, Suk-eui Min's father.

647
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,540
That can't be done, Your Majesty!

648
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,020
 That can't be done, Your Majesty! 

649
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,990
    
  (Grand Queen Dowager's quarters) 

650
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,610
There's no need to sit.

651
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,920
When do you think I can resume my regency?

652
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,360
Don't you think it needs to be done before the king ruins Joseon?

653
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,050
There will be no more incidents causing our clan to lose its posts.

654
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,560
And since I've started to reform the military, the end of the king's world will come soon.

655
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,450
Hurry up, as I'm not the patient type.

656
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,100
Yes.

657
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:30,190
By the way, I heard something odd.

658
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,940
That the queen is teaching the king blasphemous ideas.

659
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,030
   

660
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,490
 Kim So-yong 

661
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,040
You still have this book.

662
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,620
 (Includes scribbling in Korean letters) 

663
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,430
Are all of these Thieves of Donghak?

664
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,560
Yes.

665
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,640
 Let go! 

666
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,190
Mother!

667
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,700
Mother!

668
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,960
What did we do wrong?

669
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,290
Cheon Ah! Cheon Ah!

670
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,800
Do you know this writing?

671
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,960
These are encrypted words used by Thieves of Donghak.

672
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,620
For a war, it's all about how good your items are.

673
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,440
Ah-yi-tem-bal... Is it some sort of 4-word idiom?

674
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,780
Because one grenade can be more effective than ten soldiers.

675
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,770
It feels like she's just making this up.

676
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:23,180
Well, I just remembered, there was a number 15 in the commando PT routines.

677
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,410
Well, the name sounds very trustworthy... grenade.

678
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,160
If you put the explosive powder in this kind of bag and threw it... BAM!

679
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,720
It explodes.

680
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,560
We already use those.

681
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,650
Bigyeokjincheon-rwoe. 
  (T/N: a kind of timed shell, meaning "fly and attack like lightning and thunder in the sky") 

682
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,110
Ah, really?  Then, what about a bullet-proof vest?

683
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,770
Clothing to stop bullets?  You mean, armor?

684
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,180
You wear bulletproof vests on the inside.

685
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,120
 Office Hong! 

686
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,090
I was walking by and saw the lightsâ€”

687
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,670
You're here.

688
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,250
You! What are you playing without me?

689
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,080
You've gathered all these people here.

690
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,180
Lee Saeng-mang!

691
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,390
You were alive!

692
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,070
Do you know how worried I was?

693
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,520
I finally get to see you. Finally!

694
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,480
Nice to see you.

695
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,760
How come you never came back to Oktajeong?  Hoping to see you again,

696
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,760
I've drunk so many times at Oktajeong and the amount might be more than millions.

697
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,950
Lee Saeng-mang!

698
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:48,340
Who are you that you're grabbing someone like that?

699
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,260
Then, who are you?

700
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,650
I am Lee Saeng-mang's best friend and buddy.

701
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,360
Buddy? I amâ€”

702
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,620
Your Majâ€”

703
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,600
I am...

704
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,000
You seem familiar.

705
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,720
He's my friend, Jong-cheol.

706
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,920
Says who?

707
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,990
If not, then who are you?

708
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,150
I am Jong-cheol.

709
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:20,400
Oh, yeah!  Hwang-bong-geuk-ho! 
  (T/N: best stick combination = person-bird-star-deer) 

710
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:26,470
What have you been doing that you're so good at this game?

711
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,950
Should I say I've been wasting my youth?

712
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,620
As expected, my buddy.

713
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,570
How are we so alikeâ€”

714
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,360
This seat seems nice.

715
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,020
Did you not hide the stick somewhere? "Person-bird-star-deer" isn't easy to get.

716
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,490
Blame your own bad luck, not trying to find faults in someone else's good luck.

717
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,550
Now, let's start again.

718
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,980
For the next round, let's bet a wish.

719
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,000
Watch out with your hat.

720
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,020
 Insider (extrovert)  

721
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,140
 Outsider (introvert) 

722
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,360
 My sider, like me.  

723
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,010
This combination is reallyâ€”

724
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,340
I will help you.

725
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,420
This is a skill I've cultivated through neolttwigi. 
   (A game of jumping on a seesaw) 

726
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,950
Hwang-bong-geuk-ho! 
  (T/N: best stick combination = person-bird-star-deer) 

727
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,370
   
 (Queen's residence) 

728
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,510
He brought down the Left State Minister with such detailed evidence.

729
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:12,140
It's clear that this happened because the ledger was disclosed.

730
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,310
If that's the case, then this is just the start.

731
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,200
Even if we have to bleed, we must start cleaning up.

732
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,400
If you don't want to be caught, throw away your greed

733
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,200
and make sure to shed blood.

734
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,580
Shed blood?

735
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:36,200
If you earned wealth by selling and buying official positions, make them resign voluntarily.

736
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,630
   

737
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:42,950
 If your wealth was taken from government loans and taxes, please put them back.  

738
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,020
 All of the records should be replaced  

739
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,280
 and you should discreetly get rid of anyone who knows the situation. (Suicide note) 

740
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,330
If...

741
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:57,390
any of us hasn't cleaned up properly and is found at fault,

742
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,470
that person will take all the blame upon himself.

743
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,330
Even if we slash the Ansong Kim family,

744
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,850
Kim Byeong-in's power is getting stronger.

745
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,280
It feels like we're marking time somehow. 
  (Waiting idly by for something to happen) 

746
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,070
We must find Kim Byeong-in's dishonest dealings.

747
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:17,770
Well, there were some circumstances that he helped some people get official posts.

748
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,930
We can arrest him if only he received some property or whatnot in return,

749
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,420
but this bastard took nothing at all.

750
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:32,110
Moreover, those people that Kim Byeong-in supported to be in those positions are exceptionally loyal to him.

751
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,550
So they won't be won over by us either.

752
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,940
He is impregnable.

753
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,630
I see you guys have gathered already.

754
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:52,970
Is Lee Saeng-mang not here yet?

755
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,060
He is very faithful in his way.

756
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,400
How could he come here to gamble every day, without missing a day?

757
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,860
Don't you have any work to do?

758
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,720
This is my work to do.

759
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,340
How could this be your work?

760
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:11,370
I asked you a question.

761
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:35,700
â™ª Today of all days, it feels like you're mine, it seems like you're mine but not mine... â™ª

762
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,550
How did youâ€”

763
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,060
I was thinking about cursing the queen,

764
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,720
so I came here.

765
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,460
Me too. Me too.

766
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,920
Go first.

767
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,910
Then.

768
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,340
Your Majesty!

769
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:43,470
You can't keep pissing me off!

770
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,210
You will fall into a manure pail if you keep doing it!

771
01:04:55,830 --> 01:05:00,450
Oh, dear!  Not many people can curse better than I do, but you can.

772
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:04,190
If I were to make a suggestion you should breathe more from hereâ€”

773
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,590
Oh my...

774
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,030
I should warm up my voice.

775
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,590
You freaking bastard! You...

776
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,930
I ought toâ€”

777
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,950
Shall we do it together this time?

778
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,960
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

779
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,630
I love you, Yihwaju!

780
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,990
Milk colored, Yihwaju!

781
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:06,020
You two should try some, too.

782
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,730
Just a little. Here.

783
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,500
There you go.

784
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,810
Its color is so beautiful, Your Majesty.

785
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:19,050
The scent is also nice.

786
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,320
It fermented well. Yes, it fermented very well.

787
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,760
What did you two do that both your voices are gone?

788
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,070
Let me see.

789
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,050
Your Majesty.

790
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,490
Is it because I haven't eaten anything yet?

791
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:45,600
Then... I can just eat it for dessert.

792
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,890
See you again, Yihwaju!

793
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,630
Tarak  (milk ) colored, Yihwaju!

794
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,670
Yihwaju!

795
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:01,170
I came as fast as I could because I wanted to give it to you personally.

796
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,520
Our military strategy book is now completed.

797
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,440
â™«  Just keep going forward, not back  â™«

798
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,720
"The Book of Military and Defense."  Its title is nice.

799
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,900
It's all thanks to you.

800
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,420
Well, all I did was just tell you what I've seen.

801
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,330
- On the next page, with Officer Hong back then... 
 - Ah!

802
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,790
Whenever Officer Hong sees these drawings, he almost wets his pants.

803
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,670
Wow, you drew this really well.

804
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:41,390
My Queen. Aren't you lonely?

805
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,870
Even for me, who came to the palace after living in a different status momentarily,

806
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:52,630
adjusting to the palace, in the beginning, was so hard and lonely.

807
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:59,020
So, I'm worried about how lonely you feel as you're so different from others.

808
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,190
I don't have time to be lonely.

809
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,660
Every day is dangerous, and I'm busy running around.

810
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,380
I have someone who even makes a dictionary to understand me,

811
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,010
so I'm not lonely, thanks to you.

812
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,460
 Is it finally the ramen? 

813
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:43,030
 Do I not do it? Whatever. 

814
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,780
I didn't do it on purpose. My stomach has been like this since before-

815
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:56,750
Over there! Call the royal physician right away.

816
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,600
Is it serious?

817
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,380
It's conception.

818
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,020
Wh-What? Conception?

819
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,970
Pregnancy?

820
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,490
Congratulations!

821
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,610
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

822
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,680
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

823
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,260
You've done well, My Queen.

824
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,490
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

825
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:05,580
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

826
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,100
â™«  I, who don't have any fear in this world,  â™«

827
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:12,220
- Congratulations, Your Majesty! 
 - Congratulations, Your Majesty!

828
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:12,900
â™«  How did I end up locked in this body?  â™«

829
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,710
I'm going to be a father!

830
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,860
â™«  What on earth should I do now?   â™«

831
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,890
â™«  How complicated this is!   â™«

832
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,760
â™«  Those days to live at my pleasure and in my style, 
 they are now over!  â™«

833
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,820
â™«  How strange it is!  â™«

834
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,800
â™«  I've stayed up one night and another, 
 but I'm still in this world!  â™«

835
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,030
â™«   Bong-hwan! (It doesn't make sense to become the queen!)  â™«

836
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,970
I'm...

837
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,420
â™«   Bong-hwan! (It doesn't make sense to become the queen!)  â™«

838
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,160
...pregnant.

839
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,010
â™«   Bong-hwan! (It doesn't make sense to become the queen!)  â™«

840
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,750
â™«   Bong-hwan!  â™«

841
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,080
â™«  It doesn't make sense to be in Joseon!  â™«

842
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,790
    
â™«  What to do, Bong-hwan?  â™«

843
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:53,280
â™«  What to do, My Queen?  â™«

844
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,530
â™«  What to do, Bong-hwan?  â™«

845
01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:00,140
â™«  What to do, My Queen?  â™«

846
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,960
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

847
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,500
â™«  It doesn't make sense to become the queen!  â™«

848
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,120
â™«  Bong-hwan!   â™«

849
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,960
â™«  It doesn't make sense to be in Joseon!  â™«

850
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,330
 I'm pregnant! 

851
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:15,490
 From today on, your prenatal education will begin in full swing.  

852
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:18,250
 You must never eat any food with an unusual taste. 

853
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,080
 I'm sure you're spreading the rumor around that I told you. 

854
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,810
 They said they faked spending a night together. 

855
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,950
 What is this embarrassing pose? 

856
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,780
 Will this be enough to get rid of those rumors? 

857
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,390
 If that's the case... 

858
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,510
 If everyone believes it, it will become the truth. 

859
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:34,330
 Bring me the queen's neck this instant. This is our family clan's order. 

860
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,700
 If I try to save myself, everyone else will die. 

861
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,360
 I'll take all the blame with me.  

862
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,700
