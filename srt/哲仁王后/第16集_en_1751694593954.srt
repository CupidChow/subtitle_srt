00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,340
(This drama is purely fictional and the characters, groups, events, etc. are not related to history)

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,760
Oh my god!

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,580
(Episode 16)
Oh my god!

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:28,960
(Episode 16)

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,590
what to do
(Episode 16)

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,480
(Episode 16)

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,450
Do you know what this is? It's a valuable thing.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,570
For the nave

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,190
Why is this book for children so valuable?

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,800
That one

11
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,730
Is it the middle temple?

12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,190
Are you the one who kept me alive?

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,670
It was you, Namdaemun, who rescued me from the well?

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,920
Yes, it's me.

15
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,800
Did you forget so quickly?

16
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,190
How I suffered to carry you out

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,890
The muscles in my shoulders are still sore.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,290
I forgot about that so quickly.

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,980
This is too much

20
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,660
I'm talking about something that happened 8 years ago.

21
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,780
Isn't this the first time you fell into a well?

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,930
Where did you leave your spiritual head?

23
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,695
Why is this book so valuable to you?

24
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,855
It's a genuine famous product.

25
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,895
Say some weird things

26
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,805
After dreaming about being trapped in a well

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,370
I suddenly remembered you, the middle temple.

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,890
I thought it was because you rescued me from the well

29
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,620
But after that, you always

30
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,970
The person who saved me eight years ago overlapped

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,130
I thought maybe you were the one.

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,410
This noodle is not tasty anymore.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,380
Do you want to eat?

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,310
Enjoy it

35
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,590
Eat slowly while blowing

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,840
What are you looking at so seriously?

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,370
It is a military book recorded in the Ming Dynasty.

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
Words from the military book

39
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,550
army

40
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,500
Are you planning to start a war?

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,140
To establish the kingship

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,810
There must be a strong military force behind it.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,600
Still having nightmares?

44
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,000
The dream of dying as an incompetent king

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,530
Occasionally do

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,600
If it really becomes like that

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,890
It's not because you have any shortcomings.

48
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,180
It's just the way history is going.

49
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,380
The country was already on the road to extinction.

50
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,410
You just happen to be in this

51
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,240
So it's not your fault

52
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,330
There is also this possibility

53
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,620
So don't try so hard.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,880
Don't feel pain either

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,640
Anyway, if it's fate

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,290
It cannot be changed

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,930
After waking up from a nightmare

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,990
Sometimes I feel strange

59
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,820
Just like that dream is now

60
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,280
Now it's like the past

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,860
The incompetent king

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,790
I had a dream in the last moment before I died.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:22,030
There is still a chance to struggle now.

64
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,540
Maybe I just want to

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,630
Fighting my fate

66
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,860
This man who is obviously going to lose

67
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,540
I want to bet everything on him

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,720
(Episode 16 All in)

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,130
You will definitely win in that battle.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,450
The side that will win is our side

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,740
If I stand on your side, you will definitely win.

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,220
You are full of confidence.

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
It makes me feel more at ease.

74
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,000
Because I have a hidden weapon

75
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,470
I know the future

76
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,970
do you remember

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,470
I said I was from a world 200 years later.

78
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,250
The words of the man who came

79
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,460
Remember

80
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,900
Those ridiculous words

81
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,650
What if those words are true?

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,120
So I told you about the future.

83
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,290
Are you asking me to believe that now?

84
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,870
If it's hard to believe

85
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,010
Just think of it as if I was dreaming

86
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,870
Very clear and vivid dreams of the future

87
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,240
In this case

88
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,460
Although I don't believe those absurd words

89
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,340
But let me hear it.

90
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,100
What will North Korea look like in 200 years?

91
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,010
So

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,840
So even though it's made up,

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,220
Our country is no longer called North Korea

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,200
Republic of Korea

95
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,100
This is the future of North Korea

96
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,040
Republic of Korea?

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,980
In the Republic of Korea

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,960
The people themselves choose the king

99
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,510
This is outrageous.

100
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,060
You need to say something decent.

101
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,860
Can I believe it or be deceived?

102
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,830
It will be difficult to deal with it if you get scared so quickly.

103
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm going to say something outrageous

104
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,900
Now is the time to start

105
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,130
200 years later, neither untouchables nor officials will exist.

106
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,270
Will the system of good citizens and bad citizens disappear?

107
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,630
Of course there are other classes.

108
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,610
Earth spoon gold spoon

109
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,490
Use a spoon instead of a number plate to confirm your identity

110
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,220
Then when the people go to elect a king

111
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,370
Are you going with a spoon?

112
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
That's called voting.

113
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,390
Only if you are over 18 years old

114
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,090
The law will give permission to choose a king.

115
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,490
The right to choose a king?

116
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,190
Yes

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Why must you be over 18?

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,940
Just like this all day

119
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,600
The Queen Mother has been running around in the palace

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,920
Thanks for your hard work

121
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,330
From now on, monitor the actions of the nave.

122
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,850
It's your job

123
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,170
Big Brother

124
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,470
After becoming the youngest military commissioner

125
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,780
Become more handsome

126
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,920
Is this the end?

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,020
How come?

128
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,040
I'll just say it

129
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,040
congratulations

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,030
But brother

131
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,320
Our home and His Majesty

132
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,500
Can't we just live in harmony?

133
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,990
She also has a good relationship with the Queen Mother.

134
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,070
I don't think he's a bad guy.

135
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,360
The master does not cherish the queen as his own

136
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,010
For your own benefit

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,940
One day, I will force my empress to death.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,530
It doesn't look like that.

139
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,350
I hate this the most

140
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,190
Hiding behind a mask, hiding behind a woman

141
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,570
Hiding the true face

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,030
Living with two faces

143
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,340
The queen was also deceived by that face

144
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,900
I left my home to help my Lord.

145
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,460
And the master just took advantage of that lady.

146
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,950
To me, it sounds like

147
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,720
The Lord is obsessed with the Queen.

148
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,190
The Love Story of His Majesty

149
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,190
Among the maids

150
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,490
Shouldn't the information circulating be the most accurate?

151
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,580
Last night too

152
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,660
I don't know what interesting things they are talking about.

153
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,560
Before the meeting

154
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,000
The lights were on all night.

155
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,070
If Cheoljong succeeds

156
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,470
The world will be different in 200 years.

157
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,610
History changes

158
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,420
They disappeared during the Japanese colonial rule.

159
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
Enemies like Director Han will also disappear

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
It's not because of Cheoljong that I help him.

161
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
This is purely for me

162
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,090
Saving you is saving me

163
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,310
Niangniang

164
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,850
The Queen Mother fainted

165
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,110
Hey hey hey hey

166
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,590
Don't get up. Don't get up.

167
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,940
How did it become like this?

168
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,980
It's very dangerous to come here. How can we do this?

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,500
wrong

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,660
The palace is more dangerous.

171
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,300
My lady, you will live here from now on.

172
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,850
I will keep you safe

173
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,230
I fainted because of what happened to me.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,870
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

175
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,070
It's like I gave you a deadly poison with my own hands.

176
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,110
I made something useless and didn't take care of it.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,600
It's what they did wrong

178
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,710
It's not your fault, Dad.

179
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,940
Please don't blame yourself and take care of yourself

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,200
Now consider your health, father.

181
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,770
I don't care about anything

182
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,840
As long as you are happy

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't care what happens

184
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,490
So, my lady

185
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Now get down from that position.

186
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,880
Father

187
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,500
Zhao Rong

188
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,410
When your mother was pregnant with you

189
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,740
Always told me this

190
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,950
Say you will live in a good world where she has never lived

191
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,430
She said she would do something she had never done before.

192
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Will live a better life than yourself

193
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,580
It was your mother's last dream.

194
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,490
Now I

195
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,160
I don't know how to meet your mother.

196
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,350
Father

197
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,600
Now I will do what my mother wants.

198
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,710
I intend to repay them double

199
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,560
Niangniang

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,150
So you can't become weak.

201
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,060
You have something to do for me

202
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,910
OK

203
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,930
Just tell me what you need

204
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,630
I'll do whatever it takes.

205
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,660
(clearance)

206
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,800
What's up with this miser?

207
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,210
You won't ask us to pay double in the future, will you?

208
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,140
Oh my god

209
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,290
Thanks

210
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,590
May you and the Queen live forever.

211
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,180
A sack of rice?

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,680
Isn't he really crazy?

213
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
It's crazy beautiful.

214
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,590
You have something to do for me

215
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,370
Get out of corruption.

216
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,960
Then you need to accumulate fame

217
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,100
Do you really want to sell all of these and divide them up?

218
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,560
Of course

219
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,080
Anyway, these financial

220
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,060
It's not something you can take with you after you die.

221
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,370
That one has to be let go.

222
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,570
Material desire becomes a habit

223
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,640
The father-in-law really made a great decision.

224
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,730
Not only that

225
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,910
This is the ledger you've been looking for.

226
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,440
My father memorized all that.

227
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,560
Everyone is more trashy than you think

228
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,650
Left Councillor

229
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,590
I have done a lot of activities in the Huanqu area

230
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,880
Various methods were used to transfer

231
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,680
That scale is very large

232
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,300
Leading the government

233
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,000
His specialty is using land to do business

234
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:16,890
For example

235
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,240
To force the land to be their own

236
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,780
Then there are a lot of taxes

237
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,440
There is no one who is not corrupt.

238
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,820
There is nothing I haven't done

239
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,560
Military corruption

240
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,970
Employment corruption is beyond words.

241
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,400
Replace the salt boat with one full of stones

242
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,110
I took all the salt for myself.

243
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,780
In this way, various tributes were obtained.

244
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,060
What annoys me most is

245
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,120
Unethical high interest rate method

246
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,900
Dropping a tax bomb on farmers

247
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,700
Lend them money at high interest rates

248
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,220
As long as you breathe, your debt will increase.

249
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,760
What they did was hooliganism.

250
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,650
The memory of the father-in-law is really amazing

251
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,400
that

252
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,630
How are internal whistleblowers treated?

253
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,190
What will it be like?

254
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,240
Guozhang

255
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,900
All this corruption is just speculation.

256
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,750
These crimes can't go away.

257
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,560
but

258
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,390
What but

259
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,010
To me, the father-in-law is just

260
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,730
One of the corrupt people

261
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,420
but

262
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,190
He is your only relative.

263
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,980
How about this?

264
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,150
Compare the merits and demerits

265
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,000
If the merits outweigh the faults, then forgive the faults

266
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,100
Do you mean to make amends? For example?

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,390
For example

268
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,600
Help us collect evidence

269
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,380
Because it's hard to convict someone based on that ledger alone.

270
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,230
The identity of the whistleblower

271
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,310
Be sure to protect it

272
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,770
Of course

273
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,350
Your Highness, you should go to the imperial court meeting.

274
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,440
knew

275
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,600
Imperial Conference

276
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,060
If you want to get rid of garbage, you have to go to the garbage dump

277
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,090
But unless it is behind the scenes

278
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,080
Women are not allowed to attend imperial meetings.

279
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,310
Appoint my elder brother, Lord Eihei, as

280
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,100
President of the Department of Rectification

281
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,440
No, no, no

282
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,080
Why

283
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,160
The inexperienced Yongping wants to take on this position

284
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,370
Too much responsibility and obligation

285
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,410
But it has no connection with other forces.

286
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,950
The greatest virtue of being able to serve as a clerk

287
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,260
That's it

288
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,090
besides

289
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,670
Do you think I'm asking

290
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,710
Do you have the approval of the ministers?

291
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,190
Oh, Cheoljong

292
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,450
To the most critical Lingnan region

293
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
Sent a secret censor

294
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,750
Punish those who rob the people according to the law

295
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,760
The looted property

296
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,600
Will be used to help the people

297
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,040
This will serve as a model for the leaders of the eight provinces across the country.

298
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,460
Let them surrender themselves

299
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,470
No, no, no

300
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,380
The military department has also sent a military governor

301
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,120
You sent troops directly without reporting to me, right?

302
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,200
Actually

303
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,340
The rebellion of the Eastern Bandits

304
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,110
(A derogatory term used by the Donghak Party by the Donghak bandits)
The rebellion of the Eastern Bandits

305
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,150
(A derogatory term used by the Donghak Party by the Donghak bandits)

306
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,020
Similar to the past Kansai Rebellion
(A derogatory term used by the Donghak Party by the Donghak bandits)

307
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,350
Similar to the past Kansai Rebellion

308
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,970
So action needs to be taken as soon as possible

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,130
It was decided by the Border Affairs Bureau on its own.

310
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,380
The Eastern bandits caused chaos and threatened officials

311
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,870
Things that hurt Yaqian

312
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,930
So we have to find the criminal as soon as possible and punish him.

313
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,490
To avoid similar things from happening

314
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,710
We need to root out the problem, so we did this.

315
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,350
Eliminate the roots?

316
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,940
Whether it is the people who teach Dongxue

317
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,370
Still learning

318
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,230
All of them were thrown into prison and severely punished.

319
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,300
The root of all North Korea's problems today

320
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,110
In the plundering people

321
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,110
To eradicate the roots

322
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,510
I want the Sanzheng Rectification Office to investigate this matter.

323
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,890
And provide relief

324
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,410
Your Highness, you are just sitting there

325
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,340
So I don't really understand the habits of military personnel.

326
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,650
If their requirements are met

327
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,870
Will ask for more

328
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,490
Only by using powerful force to suppress

329
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,520
To ensure that the same thing doesn't happen again

330
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,310
That's it. That's it.

331
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,910
I want to check among the people who were thrown into the prison

332
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,270
Are there any victims of injustice?

333
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,830
besides

334
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,820
Severe punishment for those who participated in the looting

335
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,880
To warn others

336
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,620
Is it the Daoist official or the general official who caused the trouble?

337
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,920
(Dao Chen Shuai Chen
Inspectors and Jiedushi sent to local areas)
Is it the Daoist official or the general official who caused the trouble?

338
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,720
(Dao Chen Shuai Chen
Inspectors and Jiedushi sent to local areas)

339
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,060
We must also strictly enforce
(Dao Chen Shuai Chen
Inspectors and Jiedushi sent to local areas)

340
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,350
We must also strictly enforce

341
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,410
I actually want to use the method of compassion

342
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,860
To appease the rebellion of the Eastern bandits

343
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,620
How can you be so ignorant?

344
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,100
Before the rebellion gained momentum

345
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,100
In sending troops to suppress the rebellion of the Eastern bandits

346
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,610
What are you doing?

347
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,580
You should apply lotion before your face dries.

348
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,720
My lady has used up all of them.

349
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,590
Should we let the Queen Mother

350
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,220
If you add some lotion

351
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,670
This can't be possible.

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,570
You go out

353
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,500
yes

354
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,390
You still can't forgive the Queen?

355
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,590
If you also read the letters between her and the master

356
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,510
You can't forgive her.

357
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,090
This is not something that can be solved by forgiveness.

358
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,800
That childish love game

359
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,160
I think she can sacrifice her life.

360
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,350
Is this the price of my loyalty to your family?

361
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,190
Let me carry everything and go into exile

362
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,590
Being labeled as a traitor to the family ruined his future

363
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,910
How can you throw it away like a broken shoe?

364
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,920
You should feel lucky that you were not wiped out by Group 9.

365
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,440
At least you saved your life, didn't you?

366
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,950
Damn

367
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,930
Come with me to the palace.

368
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,230
I'll give you proof

369
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,070
I am different from my father

370
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,610
Sure enough, daytime wine is delicious

371
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,830
Hey, daytime wine

372
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,620
It's shrimp.

373
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,700
Such expensive food

374
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,430
Who are you

375
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,210
Who are you here at this time?

376
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,010
What

377
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,330
Where do you think this is?

378
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,760
What exactly do you do?

379
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,380
right

380
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,700
I am the Secret Imperial Secretary

381
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,200
This is it

382
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,650
I heard there are a lot of fake secret imperial censors recently.

383
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,830
Where to blow water?

384
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,320
Recently, the appearance of the horse brand is not as good as before.

385
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,200
The Secret Censor is on the Move

386
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
Spare my life

387
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,940
Coming soon

388
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,260
It's more useful than the Ma brand gun.

389
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,630
We are not women.

390
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,030
He invited us to have tea.

391
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,610
Why did you call us here?

392
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,380
The master has a tough policy

393
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,060
The Central Palace is a conciliatory policy

394
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,850
is that so

395
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,660
It seems to remind us that we are all of the same race.

396
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,410
Useless

397
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,840
Then cooperate with me.

398
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,790
yes

399
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,870
Go check it out

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,430
I sit in the middle hall.

401
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,690
It's been a while

402
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,010
I couldn't entertain the elders of my family.

403
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,130
So many things happened during this period.

404
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,270
Please understand

405
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,550
This is what I prepared for you.

406
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,790
Please use slowly

407
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,770
This is

408
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,910
Not tea but wine

409
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,220
Just pretend to be tea.

410
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,600
His Highness has ordered the ministers to gather together.

411
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,330
Drinking in broad daylight

412
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,830
If it is discovered

413
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,470
It was the Queen Mother who deceived us.

414
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,280
Are you setting a trap for us?

415
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,340
Yeah yeah

416
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,150
Don't bother me, I'm very upset

417
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,290
What's annoying

418
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,960
Who do you think we are?

419
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,220
I know

420
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,970
What kind of people are you here?

421
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,220
It is the cancer-like existence of this era

422
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,650
Cancer What does cancer mean

423
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,720
In the words of this era

424
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,170
This era exists like a plague

425
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,000
That's what I mean

426
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,510
Why should we listen to this nonsense?

427
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,830
Get up

428
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,530
Why is this so?

429
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,520
Good question

430
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,590
That’s a good question.

431
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,480
As expected, he is the leader of the government

432
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,940
At least he said something useful.

433
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,780
Why am I like this?

434
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,890
The way forward for His Majesty

435
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,960
I told you not to interfere.

436
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,180
From now on, every time in front of His Majesty

437
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,330
Let's sing "Never" again

438
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,490
You start from the heels

439
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,890
Carefully one by one

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,010
In order

441
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,310
In order

442
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,240
Disappear

443
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,720
If you don't want to see me later

444
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,270
There was no Anseong Jin in the Imperial Conference

445
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,330
Retract your neck.

446
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,280
The queen is also Ancheng Jin

447
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,800
That's why I changed my last name.

448
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,800
I will

449
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,790
Not Jin Zhaorong but Zhang Zhaorong

450
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,760
What

451
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,520
Not unexpectedly

452
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,640
I see you became an official because of your family

453
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,290
My brain is really not working well

454
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,380
Everyone remembers

455
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,570
It is forbidden to say "absolutely not" in the future

456
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,830
Prohibition of submitting petitions and prohibition of forming groups

457
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,170
No access to Uttarakhand

458
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,490
What happened to Wuwuwuta Pavilion?

459
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,850
Because I can't go

460
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,130
I heard that the amnesty was carried out smoothly.

461
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,220
The King and the Concubine

462
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,880
What a good choice.

463
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
I came here today to ask for something

464
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,970
Now that I have joined forces with my family

465
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,440
The matter of the Queen Mother who threatened my family

466
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,530
Please don't let this happen again

467
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,070
Our enemy is the Lord

468
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,100
We are divided among ourselves and help the enemy

469
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,820
Shouldn't it be cleared?

470
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,450
Of course

471
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,350
Rituals and spells

472
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,650
I've quit all of that for a long time.

473
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,810
Concubine

474
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,210
Something to report

475
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,630
That's right

476
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,000
To know the words of this era

477
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,580
You have to read books from this era.

478
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,380
Because I want to explain kindly

479
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,760
If you want to know the trendy language of the Joseon Dynasty

480
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,360
What should I watch?

481
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,490
That kind of thing

482
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,490
There is no such thing in the library of the palace.

483
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,760
So what

484
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,490
Outside the palace, all things are sold

485
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,020
Hangul novels can be used as reference

486
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,080
What's in it

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,720
I've heard of it before.

488
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,870
Couldn't see

489
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,450
How many do you know?

490
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,110
She was originally a good wife and mother.

491
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,910
Died after being abandoned by her husband

492
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,920
That soul

493
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,710
I came back after I had a mole next to my mouth removed.

494
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,990
A story of revenge

495
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,790
A story that feels familiar

496
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,910
What is the title of the book?

497
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,460
The temptation of women

498
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,030
Didn't you say you didn't watch it?

499
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,160
Just the title

500
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,250
Only know the title

501
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,600
And what else

502
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,440
Nothing else?

503
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,950
This is the most recent

504
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,700
This is the story of the lady in the back room.

505
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Adults cheating with the young lady next door

506
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,300
Husband and wife have a different world

507
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,950
no

508
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,390
Choi Sang-Gong

509
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,460
Didn't you say you didn't see it? Why are you so angry?

510
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,430
The slaves are terrified

511
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,710
It seems that people have similar ideas.

512
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,210
Why do this?

513
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,650
You guys go out first

514
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,960
yes

515
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,060
For the safety of the Queen

516
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,710
Need family strength

517
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,150
Why turn family into enemy?

518
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,750
I think you forgot

519
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,470
The old stubborn people in that family are going to kill me

520
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,690
I'm making the Queen of the Temple

521
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,280
A way to go back again

522
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't want to go back

523
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
I am during this time

524
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,350
In order to please the Queen Mother

525
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,490
I've done everything.

526
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,960
I don't feel so tired even in the Blue House

527
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,270
But do you know what the cost is?

528
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,640
Toxic ice cubes

529
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,920
This happened because of Zhao's plot to sow discord.

530
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,790
Didn't I say I would protect you?

531
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,560
I'll tell you clearly

532
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,970
After all, the longer this kind of thing is delayed, the worse it will be.

533
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,220
I can't agree with you.

534
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,410
I didn't use your ideas.

535
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,780
I

536
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,400
The path I'm taking is different from yours.

537
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,980
It's best for us to go our own way

538
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,690
I am the lady's person

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,780
Why is it the Lord?

540
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,800
Unless it's the Lord's words

541
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,660
I will follow whatever the queen wants.

542
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,970
Why

543
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,600
It has nothing to do with the Lord

544
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,840
It's just not you

545
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,240
Don't let go of my hand, Zhaorong

546
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,760
You are everything to me

547
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,500
Yuzhen

548
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,190
Even the hair must be identical

549
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,050
Not only His Highness's appearance

550
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,530
Draw the inside too.

551
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,010
It cannot contain the painter’s personality

552
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,020
nave

553
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,030
Do you have any concerns?

554
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,530
Not that

555
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,300
Not in a good mood

556
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,890
nave

557
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,340
What are you doing

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,770
If you stretch your face, you will sound like a king.

559
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,180
If the face is shrunk, it will make the voice of a eunuch.

560
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,240
Isn't it funny?

561
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,590
To make the nave laugh

562
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,380
It's really not easy

563
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,530
In this case

564
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,470
If you shrink your body, you will make the sound of a servant.

565
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,780
If you stretch your body

566
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,920
Will make the general's voice

567
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,340
Isn't it funny?

568
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,160
Laughed

569
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,140
Your Highness

570
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,870
You have to reposition yourself.

571
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,550
Um

572
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,890
I'll show you later.

573
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,150
but

574
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,100
Why do you want to paint portraits all of a sudden?

575
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,250
According to the principle of ancestral merits and virtues

576
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,660
Shunzong was honored as Shunzu

577
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,550
therefore

578
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,120
I must also follow

579
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,680
As a memorial

580
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,020
Ancestor's Merits and Virtues

581
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,480
I've obviously heard this.

582
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,310
When deciding the king's posthumous title

583
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,300
Those who have made contributions will be named ancestors

584
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,200
The principle of ennobling a virtuous king as the patriarch

585
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,660
I remember now

586
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,210
Niangniang

587
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,810
This is what you said

588
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,530
let me see

589
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
The finished product is very well made

590
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,050
Do you want to learn swordsmanship?

591
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,760
When it comes to swordsmanship, I am the best

592
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,540
I don't need to learn swordsmanship alone

593
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,690
After all, I already have a knife.

594
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,120
this

595
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,320
Bought for the noble.

596
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,890
Gift

597
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,680
Noble

598
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,660
Is it my turn?

599
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,580
You're waiting.

600
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,030
sorry

601
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,650
People who have been pushed back to the inner room

602
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,130
Do I need to face it?

603
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,170
So interesting

604
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,720
Said to form an alliance

605
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,680
But he abdicated without saying goodbye

606
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,020
You didn't discipline your husband.

607
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,860
So it doesn't guarantee my safety.

608
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,330
I always have plans.

609
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,210
Before you mess with me

610
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,460
What is the plan?

611
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,020
A plan to live a safe and boring life

612
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,630
Draw your sword

613
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,400
I don't fight with women.

614
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,190
I regret not being able to prepare for the resignation ceremony.

615
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,740
A gift for you

616
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,140
On the Blade

617
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,510
It has been engraved all along

618
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,320
Mr. Kim Jageun's achievements

619
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,490
Pull it out

620
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,110
This is exactly

621
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,520
Your life so far

622
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,430
Became the Middle Temple

623
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,760
What can you do with this woman's body?

624
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,920
You said that, didn't you?

625
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,680
See what I can do.

626
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,450
Because from now on

627
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,980
I have no cooling, no brakes, and no way out.

628
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,060
Your Highness

629
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,190
Yipin is here

630
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,530
Let her in

631
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,370
how's it going

632
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,210
Sort out the messy thoughts

633
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,930
I feel relieved.

634
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,210
Very good

635
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,270
It's so late, but we still have a lot of business.

636
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,320
Not enough to worry me.

637
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,730
If I knew that this would become something His Highness cherished so much

638
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,880
It will be written more cleanly.

639
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,250
So messy

640
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,540
You are very busy

641
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,780
It seems I delayed too long.

642
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,740
Then I'll take my leave first

643
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,170
Concubine

644
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,220
I have something I haven't been able to say to you.

645
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,040
I just want to you

646
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,620
It's not because it's the child I saw in the well eight years ago.

647
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,570
Only with heart

648
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,950
I met you again when I returned to Hanyang

649
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,680
I think it's good too

650
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,140
Your Highness

651
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,170
Yongping Jun comes in

652
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,020
Kindness is here

653
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,510
Getting ready to leave

654
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,500
Let's chat

655
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,700
What are you talking about?

656
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,570
The truth that no one wants

657
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,970
I should probably avoid it.

658
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,590
This passionate look

659
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,150
This is called social and perverted

660
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,210
All you think about the whole day is listening to my class.

661
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,380
Today too

662
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,300
Although I won't believe it

663
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,410
But let’s talk about the future.

664
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,900
Today's topic is

665
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,160
(Constitutional monarchy)

666
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,630
Constitutional monarchy

667
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,430
Constitutional monarchy

668
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,930
Not ruling by kingship

669
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,070
Although there is a king

670
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,340
But it is a way to return power to the people

671
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,850
There is a country called Bhutan

672
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,010
What an unfamiliar name.

673
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,260
It's very strange now.

674
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,910
There is a king who is even more unfamiliar to you

675
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,420
This king will be an absolute monarchy like North Korea

676
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Became a constitutional monarchy

677
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,750
Why this happened

678
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,740
Said it was because I was afraid of the distant future

679
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,500
A foolish monarch brought the country to ruin.

680
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,090
That's why the constitution

681
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,380
Make laws and rule by law

682
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,560
The monarch is only a symbolic presence

683
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,010
How wise!

684
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,540
Such a transformation

685
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,740
What's that person's name?

686
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,280
Until now

687
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,770
You go home

688
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,740
Home?

689
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,180
Where is that?

690
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,840
friend

691
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,230
You drank too much

692
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't even remember my home.

693
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,170
I will first

694
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,760
Go home and lie down

695
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,270
I have no home

696
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,350
Nothing

697
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,400
The place you want to go is also owned by you.

698
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,290
I have nothing now.

699
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,040
I'm not because

700
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,720
This is the child I saw in the well eight years ago.

701
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,730
Only with heart

702
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,480
Hanyang

703
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,030
Your Highness can't possibly know.

704
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,850
this

705
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,340
Not possible now

706
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,760
I must see His Majesty.

707
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,510
no

708
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,260
that

709
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,750
Your Highness

710
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,170
I am Hua Zhen

711
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,620
that is

712
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,470
Together with this half-man, half-woman nave

713
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,590
Complete the military book

714
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,900
That's great.

715
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,550
Don't be biased

716
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,790
The Nave Conceives Us

717
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,830
New and interesting content that you have never heard of before

718
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,030
At once

719
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,920
Come and listen

720
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,720
Before that

721
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,150
I have a death military training method

722
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,940
How about teaching this first?

723
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,750
ah

724
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,960
Dead?

725
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,870
1 2 3 7

726
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,420
The sound is too quiet

727
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,370
Can it only be this big?

728
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,420
I see

729
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,530
Skip it now.

730
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,820
It's only the 8th now.

731
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,430
There are more actions in total

732
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,240
The last time I didn't shout slogans

733
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,460
Once you've shouted the slogan, you have to start from the beginning

734
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,810
1 2 3 6

735
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,170
Look carefully

736
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,830
Bringing the Central Palace to the Military Book is very dangerous.

737
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,100
She is the one who declares war on her family

738
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,770
Is it necessary to ask her to prove that she is on our side?

739
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,260
Really a lot

740
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,900
Lift your feet

741
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,890
1 2 3 8

742
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,740
Oops

743
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,030
8 is the last

744
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,260
Start from scratch

745
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:29,970
no

746
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,900
Say it's death

747
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,660
Do I really have to die to end this?

748
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,260
Start from scratch

749
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,190
1 2

750
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,520
Niangniang

751
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,450
Because I didn't know I was going to become a monster.

752
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,870
I'm turning into a monster little by little every day.

753
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,960
This level of false records

754
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,680
(False record)
This level of false records

755
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:09,870
(False record)

756
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,850
It's enough to bring down the Left Councillor.
(False record)

757
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,190
It's enough to bring down the Left Councillor.

758
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,050
Let's go

759
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,220
yes

760
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,280
Your Highness, Concubine Yi has arrived.

761
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,050
Let her in

762
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,610
I have something to tell you

763
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,310
Yongping-kun, do you want to go out first?

764
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,620
The Kindness

765
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,840
Please

766
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,140
I've been chatting with the Queen Mother every night recently.

767
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,150
What was said

768
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,040
My dream of North Korea

769
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,270
I thought I would be the one to share the dream with His Highness.

770
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,070
When the Queen shares her worries

771
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,460
I'm just lying

772
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,170
Not anymore.

773
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,920
I am not the master of the children's learning

774
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,650
So you know

775
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,490
Why don't you say anything?

776
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,530
Because nothing will change

777
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,030
How come nothing has changed?

778
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,240
Your Highness's heart

779
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,450
No more trust in me

780
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,210
Your Highness looks at me differently now

781
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,910
Not because of a lie

782
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,290
The time you spend with me will disappear

783
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,490
The fact that I have been close to you for two years will not change

784
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,970
It's for me to pretend I don't know.

785
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,770
Because His Highness is that kind of person

786
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:15,560
You think you know

787
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:17,960
But if you pretend you don't know, will I be happy?

788
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,760
Hua Zhen

789
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,920
I framed the Queen Mother

790
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,220
I found the account book at the father-in-law's house

791
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,950
To the Queen Mother

792
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:30,700
Not why

793
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,930
Because I hate the nave.

794
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,190
Don't you know it when you see the account book?

795
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,260
That's what I need

796
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,860
I knew it but I did it anyway

797
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,440
How could you do this to me?

798
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,800
You know my dream better than anyone else

799
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,690
But trampled on my dreams

800
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,760
My dream is that your highness

801
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,680
But His Highness's heart began to move towards the middle hall.

802
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,440
Although for my sake

803
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,500
But I can't help but be attracted by the nave.

804
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,070
Seeing His Majesty like this

805
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,260
I became more and more miserable

806
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,610
I gradually lost myself

807
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,650
It was my fault

808
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,680
I made you like this.

809
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,570
It was my fault

810
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,320
Not your own

811
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,070
It is not okay to have feelings of admiration

812
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,970
Now I want to find myself

813
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,660
(There is a difference between husband and wife in this world)

814
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:12,810
This damn supervisor
(There is a difference between husband and wife in this world)

815
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,680
This damn supervisor

816
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,490
Next

817
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,380
(The world of husband and wife is different)

818
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:26,100
Your Majesty, aren't you going to Xizheng Hall tonight?

819
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,060
Otherwise, let's just leave it at that for today.

820
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,170
Our Cheoljong must be waiting for me

821
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,080
I have it too.

822
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,820
The soul of a scholarly family

823
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,940
Just read one more chapter

824
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,470
(Jin Zhaoyong)

825
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,760
Sorry, Sorry

826
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,840
I think I'll just read one chapter.

827
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,640
But I can't stop at all

828
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,850
But why haven't you changed your clothes?

829
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,120
What

830
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,640
Why why give me this

831
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,870
Didn't I say I'll give it back to you if you want to live?

832
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,210
It turns out that not knowing the truth can also hurt people

833
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,100
It took too long to return to the owner.

834
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,370
Sorry I didn't recognize you

835
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,630
I haven't been honest with you for too long.

836
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,230
After eight years, the owner was found.

837
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,300
The time that was lost cannot be reversed

838
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,300
But I won't make the mistake of missing the central temple again.

839
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,910
but

840
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,740
What has the Central Temple experienced in these eight years?

841
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,540
Although it's a bit strange

842
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,860
But not that weird

843
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,170
Did I miss something?

844
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,310
yes

845
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,730
Looks good.

846
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,830
Although I don't know what it is

847
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,250
It's medicine

848
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,810
Stealing is definitely good

849
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:13,480
Yogurt tastes like wine

850
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,920
This is pear wine.

851
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,240
When the pear blossoms bloom, brew them in a jar

852
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,910
The wine I drink when there is a faint scent of pear blossoms

853
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,860
Give me a cup

854
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,470
That was the last bite.

855
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,120
This wine is too hard to brew.

856
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,430
I don't know how to cherish when I drink

857
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,270
Damn

858
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,620
Here's how it's done

859
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,380
Add water to the buckwheat flour and knead it into a dough

860
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,090
Flatten the dough and make a hole in the middle to make it easier to cook.

861
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,620
It is a winter shape

862
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,430
Keep doing it

863
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,730
one way or another

864
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:57,080
Cook it in hot water and let it cool

865
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,460
Add the wine yeast called Huagu to re-knead the dough

866
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,630
Put this in the wine jar and cover it.

867
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,880
Three days later

868
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:09,960
Then you can

869
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,400
How come?

870
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,710
Then I stirred it again.

871
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,040
After twenty days

872
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,190
You can drink it then.

873
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,360
Time is passing quickly

874
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,660
Come on, ok

875
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,270
Left Councillor Jin Shigen conspired with local governors

876
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:41,060
The crime of plundering peasants and abusing power

877
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,700
Deprivation of official position, confiscation of property and imprisonment

878
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,940
How dare you

879
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:55,850
Let me go, let me go

880
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,590
Not yet

881
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,310
I didn't expect the declaration of war from the middle temple to be true.

882
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:12,470
The vacant seat of the Left State Councilor was held by Min Suk-bi's father

883
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,440
The Yongxing Min family's Min Houjin is in charge

884
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,960
No, Your Highness

885
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,690
No, Your Highness. No, Your Highness.

886
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,690
No need to sit

887
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,480
When will the regency begin again?

888
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,660
Shouldn't we start before His Highness destroys Joseon?

889
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,010
Our door position will not be taken away again

890
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,740
And we have started to prepare the army.

891
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,110
Your Highness's reign will not last long.

892
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,690
Come on, I'm not the kind of person who procrastinates.

893
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,680
yes

894
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:00,410
But I heard something strange

895
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,480
The middle temple is disrespectful to the church.

896
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,620
This book is still

897
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,430
Are they all Eastern bandits?

898
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,580
yes

899
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,830
Let me go

900
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,850
Grandma, grandma, grandma

901
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,380
Oh, why are you like this?

902
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,860
Cancan

903
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,210
Can you recognize whose handwriting this is?

904
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,450
This is

905
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,330
The secret code of the Eastern Bandits

906
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,210
The so-called war

907
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,620
No matter what, it depends on item

908
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,300
By item

909
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,660
Is this a four-character idiom?

910
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,140
Compared to ten soldiers

911
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,180
A grenade might be more effective.

912
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:50,310
Why do I feel like she's talking nonsense?

913
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,810
Yeah, I finally remembered.

914
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,430
15 more guerrilla gymnastics

915
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,900
The solution you came up with is extremely wise.

916
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:57,850
Grenade

917
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,670
Put the gunpowder in a bag like this and throw it out

918
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,790
Bang

919
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:05,310
explode

920
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,310
Already have

921
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,370
Flying Thunder

922
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:10,870
Is that so?

923
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,620
What about bulletproof vests?

924
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,100
Bomb-blocking clothing

925
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,660
Are you a nail guy?

926
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,780
The bulletproof vest is to be worn inside

927
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,210
Hongbiejian

928
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,700
I was just passing by and saw your light was on

929
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,760
You are here

930
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,160
you

931
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,470
What are you playing? Why don't you take me with you?

932
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,600
So many people were called.

933
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,270
Ouch

934
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,170
Li Shengli

935
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,940
You're still alive

936
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,380
Do you know how much I worry about you?

937
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,080
I finally see you

938
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,980
finally

939
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,780
Ouch

940
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,290
Nice to meet you

941
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,720
Why didn't you come to Utate Pavilion again?

942
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,330
I thought maybe I could see you again

943
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,460
They drank hundreds of taels of wine at Wuta Pavilion.

944
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,950
Li Shengli

945
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:10,800
no

946
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,310
Who are you that likes to win over?

947
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,320
Then who are you?

948
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,310
I am Li Shengrui's best friend

949
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,970
Friends

950
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,280
I am

951
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:29,670
temple

952
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,030
I am

953
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,500
Why do I feel like you look familiar?

954
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,410
My friends

955
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,100
Zhong Zhe

956
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,170
Why

957
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,060
Then who are you?

958
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,720
I am Zhong Zhe

959
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,530
Oh yeah

960
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,840
Gold Medal

961
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,090
Where on earth are you from

962
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,570
So awesome

963
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,060
After all, I wasted so much of my youth

964
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,410
You are indeed my friend.

965
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,450
So similar to me

966
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,730
Oh, this location

967
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,580
It seems like good feng shui.

968
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,910
Are you hiding your cards?

969
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,830
The gold medal is not that easy to get.

970
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,860
Don't blame others for their good luck if you are unlucky

971
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,760
Okay, let's go on.

972
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,980
Bet on your wish

973
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,670
Everybody be careful.

974
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,560
Insider

975
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,870
Outsider

976
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,360
My sider like me

977
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,350
My sider

978
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,730
This combination is really

979
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,820
I'll help you

980
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,920
This is the strength I gained from climbing over the wall

981
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,380
Gold Medal

982
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,170
It takes such concrete evidence.

983
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Drag the left-wing parliament out of office

984
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,760
this

985
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,530
This is definitely a leak of the account books.

986
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,830
So now is the beginning

987
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,130
Huh

988
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,030
Even if I really have to lose three thousand

989
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,590
We must do it too.

990
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,730
If you don't want to be caught,

991
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,880
It's better to let go of greed and bleed a little

992
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,010
bleed

993
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,410
If someone gains personal gain through buying and selling official positions

994
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,800
Then we have to let him give up his position.

995
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,550
If you embezzle food and tribute

996
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:12,910
It is to return it

997
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,520
Drop all records

998
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,440
Even those who knew about it must be dealt with.

999
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,020
(Suicide Note)
Even those who knew about it must be dealt with.

1000
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,420
(Suicide Note)

1001
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:22,680
just in case

1002
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:27,920
Someone is really caught

1003
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,200
Then he must bear all the responsibility

1004
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,710
Even if we take down Ancheng and Kinmen

1005
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,980
Kim Byung-in's power also grew

1006
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,610
Why are we always standing still?

1007
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,980
We must find Kim Byung-in's corruption

1008
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,250
I doubt if he is buying or selling official positions.

1009
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,850
But what price did he get?

1010
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,400
Put him in jail.

1011
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,960
But that guy didn't get any benefit at all

1012
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,850
not to mention

1013
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,660
The people under Kim Byung-in are too loyal

1014
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,010
There is no way to win over

1015
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,490
It's really hard to understand.

1016
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,050
You've all arrived

1017
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,430
Has Li Shengli not arrived yet?

1018
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:23,670
etc.

1019
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,420
That guy is really diligent in this regard.

1020
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,920
He never forgets to come here to gamble every day.

1021
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,340
Don't you have anything to do?

1022
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,600
This is my business

1023
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,450
How can this be your business?

1024
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,830
I'm asking you a question.

1025
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,870
Only today seems to be mine but not mine

1026
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,920
Like mine

1027
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,090
no

1028
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,050
How could you

1029
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,760
Ouch

1030
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,730
I want to come and scold the Queen Mother

1031
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,550
Me too Me too

1032
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,000
Please first

1033
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,310
So

1034
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:14,800
My lady, please don't be angry with me all the time, can you?

1035
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:24,460
You always get into trouble like that.

1036
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,040
Really

1037
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,720
Few people can curse better than me.

1038
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,230
Here is a suggestion for you: breathe more

1039
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:34,970
no

1040
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,130
Really

1041
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,810
I also want to open my voice

1042
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:41,490
yes

1043
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,660
You stinky woman, you are really funny

1044
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,540
Be careful of me

1045
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,190
Oops

1046
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,730
So this time we're together

1047
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,500
good

1048
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,980
MILF

1049
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,980
I love you pear blossom wine

1050
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,660
Milk Skin Pear Blossom Wine

1051
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:33,960
Come

1052
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,180
Come Come

1053
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,690
You guys come and try it too

1054
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,320
A little bit

1055
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,310
Give

1056
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:43,580
Give

1057
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,350
This color is so beautiful, sis.

1058
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,180
The scent is also very good

1059
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,460
It's a good brew.

1060
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,820
Yeah, it's brewed well.

1061
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,630
you

1062
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,350
What happened? My voice is hoarse.

1063
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,720
Let me try it

1064
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,720
Niangniang

1065
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,030
MILF

1066
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,840
Is it because of fasting?

1067
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:12,840
So

1068
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,620
Let's have it as dessert after dinner.

1069
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:20,490
See you next time. Pear Blossom Wine

1070
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:24,100
Love's Luster Pear Blossom Wine

1071
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,360
Pear wine

1072
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,860
I want to convey this to the Middle Temple personally

1073
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,320
He immediately ran over

1074
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,420
I have written it all

1075
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:38,840
Um

1076
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,120
Military equipment overview

1077
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,170
It's a good name.

1078
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,750
This is all thanks to you

1079
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm just telling you what I know

1080
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,140
Next

1081
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,690
At that time, Hongbyeol

1082
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,320
Hong Biejian saw this painting

1083
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,980
Urine is coming out

1084
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,120
Wow, nice drawing.

1085
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,280
nave

1086
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,820
Don't you feel lonely?

1087
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,300
Even if you have lived as someone else

1088
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,640
I entered the palace later

1089
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,290
When I first adapted to life in the palace

1090
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,140
It's lonely and hard

1091
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,950
How lonely would the unique nave be?

1092
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,680
I'm worried

1093
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,730
Where is the time to be alone?

1094
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,940
I'm busy jumping into danger every day

1095
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,270
Someone wants to understand me

1096
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,180
Don't hesitate to cause trouble everywhere

1097
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,680
Thanks to you, I am not alone at all

1098
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,850
Is it finally time to eat ramen?

1099
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:10,780
want

1100
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,290
Don't want

1101
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,450
Really

1102
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,210
No, I didn't mean it.

1103
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,580
I just started to have stomach problems.

1104
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,140
Someone come

1105
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,130
Quickly send the doctor

1106
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,050
Is the condition not good?

1107
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,890
You are pregnant

1108
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,500
What is pregnant?

1109
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,480
Pregnant

1110
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,460
Congratulations to both of you

1111
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,580
Thank you for your hard work, Central Palace

1112
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,580
Congratulations to the Queen

1113
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,820
I'm going to be a father

1114
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:08,420
I

1115
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,810
Pregnant

1116
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:20,850
(This drama is purely fictional and the characters, families, dynasties, and events that appear in it have nothing to do with history)

1117
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,210
(Preview of the next episode)

1118
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,730
How can I get pregnant?

1119
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:47,090
You will start prenatal education today.

1120
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,910
Do not eat any unusual food

1121
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,030
The rumor I prepared for her

1122
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,700
It should have spread.

1123
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,250
It is said that they have their own palaces.

1124
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,460
What is this shameful posture?

1125
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,230
Can this level appease the rumors?

1126
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,300
So

1127
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,050
Everyone believes it is the fact

1128
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,580
Bring me the head of the nave immediately

1129
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,910
This is the order of the house.

1130
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,030
If I want to live

1131
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,140
Everyone is going to die

1132
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,850
Just leave everything to me.
