1
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,380
(This drama is purely fictional characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,240
How much did she hear?

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,900
From the time when her life was in danger

4
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
The first sentence I said

5
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,010
If she said she heard nothing

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,250
Not her

7
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,460
I would kill her immediately.

8
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,170
Because she has heard everything.

9
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,320
you

10
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,460
If you dare to kill me

11
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,850
You will regret it forever.

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,010
This isn't the end yet.

13
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,020
this

14
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,320
Put it aside first

15
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,930
Wait a moment

16
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,360
(Episode 3)

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,160
Um

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,210
You won the lottery today.

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,330
look

20
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,100
Pretty, huh?

21
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:19,948
It's all yours.

22
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,368
Is she stalling for time?

23
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:23,838
What what

24
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:25,108
Aren't you a thief?

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,090
Damn

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,330
Do you know who I am?

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,150
I am...

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,200
Will confess his identity as a middle temple

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,910
But he's from the special forces.

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,320
Go ahead

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,290
Hey, you thought it was a cook

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,410
Are they all the same cooks?

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,600
Special Soldier's Cook

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,910
Even if you give him a kitchen knife, he can catch ghosts.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Go ahead

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm not afraid at all

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,670
Go up, go up, go up

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,720
Such weird words

39
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,310
How did she make it sound so real?

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,640
Wow, that's amazing

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,480
His face is his weak point

42
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
It's amazing

43
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,980
Now His Highness is covering his face

44
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,830
Trying to hide your identity

45
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,710
What guy

46
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,990
I am Kim Byung-in from the family of Mr. Kim Jageun.

47
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,390
Sir, why are you here?

48
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,500
Have you been robbed?

49
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,160
That person didn't go far.

50
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,970
Search for me quickly

51
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,810
He is not alone

52
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,760
yes

53
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,520
Search separately

54
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,940
Are you okay?

55
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,880
cousin

56
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,380
cousin

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,960
Is this the way he looks at his sister?

58
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,080
Shao Rong

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,380
How scared were you?

60
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,130
Who on earth dares to...

61
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,480
Gold again...

62
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,750
Damn

63
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,450
What is it?

64
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm searching for suspicious people.

65
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,660
Damn

66
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,390
What are you doing?

67
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,120
They scare me.

68
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,910
I've even reported it.

69
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,170
This card is void

70
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,670
Who allowed it to be cancelled?

71
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,480
Then you know my cards.

72
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,390
Do you want to continue?

73
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,510
It's obviously your fault

74
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,750
Why should I suffer?

75
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
You little bastard

76
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,320
Damn, too much vomit.

77
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Are you spitting at me now?

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,950
No matter

79
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,620
Damn

80
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,580
Catch that guy

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,740
Catch that guy

82
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,940
What are you standing for?

83
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,090
Close the door and get out right now

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,800
To prevent Hongbiejian from escaping

85
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,340
You are pretending

86
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,950
Obviously you can't beat me

87
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,770
That guy

88
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,550
I must make him an adult today.

89
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,790
Please help me

90
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,830
Next time

91
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,880
What are you doing? Get out now.

92
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,330
The little one will go out now.

93
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,870
Hongbiejian

94
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,090
I must teach you a lesson today.

95
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,140
Very realistic.

96
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,760
Isn't it true that people are not allowed to make jokes?

97
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,420
How can you really swing a knife?

98
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,200
Not over there

99
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,810
I haven't married yet.

100
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,140
Let's go

101
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,580
no

102
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,310
You dare to use a knife on me?

103
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,750
You're not hurt, are you?

104
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm fine

105
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,550
I didn't expect that she would come with Kim Byung-in.

106
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,330
Did they set a trap?

107
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,100
It is impossible for the Nave to come out personally as bait.

108
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,480
What's more, the reaction of the middle temple is so strange.

109
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm not too sure

110
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,520
If you act rashly without knowing the situation at this moment

111
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm afraid it will bring even greater disaster.

112
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,730
Let's wait and see

113
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,880
But

114
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,630
If the middle temple heard everything

115
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,770
I was the one communicating with the middle temple.

116
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,550
Please believe me

117
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,850
It's your highness

118
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,620
If I'm wrong

119
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,220
There is no way to avoid this bloody storm

120
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,130
(Episode 3: Sleeping with the Enemy)

121
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,770
This is a distinguished guest

122
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,770
What kind of distinguished guest is this? Unless it's the king.

123
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,940
Put away the knife quickly

124
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,780
Put away the knife

125
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,400
Let's go

126
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,020
I hope no one knows about this.

127
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,080
yes

128
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,140
Niangniang

129
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,340
She fainted from shock.

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,800
Go get ready for tomorrow morning.

131
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,290
I have to take good care of her without telling others.

132
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,100
yes

133
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,680
Madam, why are you here?

134
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,800
Brother again

135
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,200
The only person who can find me is my brother.

136
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,460
Those who will hold a wedding ceremony tomorrow

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,490
How come you are here?

138
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,880
I feel like I'm going crazy

139
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,460
So he escaped from the palace.

140
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,890
But I have nowhere to go...

141
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,250
Available

142
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,500
I will try not to attract attention.

143
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,480
Send you back to the palace

144
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,850
I've had dreams since I was a kid.

145
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,580
It will come true tomorrow

146
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,550
Because my dream is to become the mother of a country

147
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,010
Tomorrow is the day my dream comes true

148
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,180
Tomorrow is my dream...

149
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,750
Disappearing Days

150
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,280
What’s wrong with you

151
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,510
I'm so scared, brother.

152
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,870
Alive

153
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,600
Living scares me

154
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,470
Niangniang

155
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,790
Don't call me that.

156
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,520
At least call me by my name today.

157
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,740
Don't let me lose myself

158
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't let me...

159
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,040
Give up the self

160
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,440
What are you afraid of?

161
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,230
I...

162
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,670
Not me

163
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,120
I always thought it was me

164
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,920
The result is not

165
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,380
Everything is a lie

166
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,810
You are Shao Rong

167
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,310
I've been watching for a long time

168
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,000
Hidden in my heart

169
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,510
Precious People

170
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,120
I won't give up on you

171
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,900
I won't forget you

172
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,840
That night

173
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,470
What on earth happened to you?

174
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,110
Kill me

175
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,970
I have called the imperial physician.

176
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,620
Please hold on a little longer, my lady.

177
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,430
That quack

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
I already have a headache

179
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,460
Don't let me see him

180
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,050
This time I'm really going to castrate him

181
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,720
Then try this.

182
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,920
So sick

183
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,420
I'm gonna throw up.

184
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,230
How much alcohol did you drink?

185
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,650
Has this woman never practiced drinking?

186
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,280
I haven't had a blackout from drinking for years.

187
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,820
How did I get back last night?

188
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,810
Fortunately, he is your cousin

189
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,590
Master Bingren sent you back.

190
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,890
It was really close to a disaster.

191
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,160
Thanks to Master Bingren

192
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm the only one who knows you went out last night

193
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,940
cousin

194
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,250
How did I meet that cousin?

195
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
The small one is not very...

196
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,520
Um

197
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,690
But the young master said, Madam, you

198
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,080
He fainted from shock.

199
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,590
What frightened you?

200
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,820
Still fainted?

201
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,310
Obviously drunk

202
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,240
Wow, but it is good to have someone to lean on.

203
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,140
The palace gates can be opened during curfew hours

204
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,860
Although he is also your cousin

205
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,380
But he is the adopted son of the Jin Zuogen family.

206
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,350
Yeah?

207
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,380
But why didn't I see Choi Sang-Gong?

208
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,420
Is she late for work?

209
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,800
The young master is worried about your drunkenness.

210
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,730
She will find out

211
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,400
Sent her out of the palace to do some work in advance

212
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,510
She refused to leave the palace

213
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,770
It took a lot of effort to convince her

214
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,040
It really took a lot of effort.

215
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,960
But everyone

216
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,430
Why don't you like leaving the palace?

217
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,700
Well, it's too dangerous outside the palace.

218
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,070
Everything in the palace is perfect.

219
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,830
Are you guys under some kind of mass hypnosis?

220
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,130
The palace is missing the most crucial thing.

221
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,290
What is it?

222
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:39,990
free

223
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,470
Um

224
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,630
What's different outside the palace?

225
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,990
Anyway, it's good that the nagging Choi Sang-Gong is not around anymore

226
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,780
My head hurts

227
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,770
This is the time when you should

228
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,270
A bowl of hot instant noodles

229
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,430
Then a bottle of sobering drink

230
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,790
But there is no instant noodles here

231
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,820
No hangover drinks

232
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,100
But I have the power

233
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,380
Really

234
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,350
Build a Fire

235
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,930
Build a Fire

236
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,660
No, what does this mean?

237
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,730
What's wrong

238
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,410
The table of food to be sent to the Dazoden

239
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,070
Um

240
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,290
What on earth are you talking about?

241
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,760
Is the soup ready?

242
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,870
That's not the case.

243
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,350
So this time...

244
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,240
Really

245
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,030
Have you tried your best?

246
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,630
So what is the problem?

247
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,680
What is the problem?

248
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,960
Really

249
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,200
Too healthy

250
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,660
Too bland

251
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,750
It's too spicy

252
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,330
Damn, are you trying to kill me?

253
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,330
I won't do it anymore.

254
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,890
If she wants to eat, let her cook it herself.

255
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,600
It's so depressing.

256
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
I do what I do.

257
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,480
Although the stove has a strong fire

258
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,940
But I can't control the heat

259
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,190
Iron pan has high thermal conductivity

260
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,770
What if you get hurt?

261
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,900
Ever since I imitated you cooking when I was a kid

262
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,040
Never been in the kitchen

263
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,000
I only imitated cooking when I was a child.

264
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,310
Better than you

265
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,100
This is dangerous stuff.

266
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,080
Is this how you take it?

267
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,130
Be careful with your hands

268
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,710
oops

269
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,470
Oh my god

270
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,840
MILF

271
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,870
Although I don't understand it very well, I tried it for the first time.

272
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,690
But I think it should be done this way

273
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,580
Probably just pretend.

274
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Can the saltiness be adjusted?

275
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,040
Of course, of course, of course

276
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,790
Of course you are right.

277
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,540
Damn

278
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,280
I

279
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
I have been in the imperial kitchen for thirty years.

280
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,040
Do you think it's that easy?

281
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,040
Why

282
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,940
Let me see

283
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,470
How bad is it?

284
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,430
Can it be delicious?

285
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,940
Really

286
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,740
Is it that bad?

287
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,990
The fragrance of rice

288
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,070
The aroma of green onions

289
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,910
And this rich six-grain fragrance

290
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,490
The taste of these three flavors blended together

291
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,590
The taste

292
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,510
Three flavors and a small pot

293
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,710
These three flavors are put into a small pot at the same time

294
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,170
Sanxiangla

295
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,870
This is Sanxiang Ramen

296
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,050
Oh, it feels so good.

297
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,820
Add some chili here and it will be perfect

298
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,150
Not bad

299
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,940
Thanks to you, my lady.

300
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,680
I have also tasted all kinds of delicacies from the mountains and the sea

301
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,500
The first time I tasted such amazing food

302
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,000
Have another bite

303
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,080
Feed me a mouthful of ramen

304
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,570
This represents true love

305
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,790
I'm afraid I'll

306
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,330
Really

307
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,510
The lady who has never touched a knife

308
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,050
You are even more delicious than what the imperial kitchen cooks

309
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,090
Is there anything else you don't know?

310
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,720
It was originally omnipotent

311
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,870
Perfect Person

312
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,770
But now I can't do the most important thing

313
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,920
What I am best at and what I like to do most

314
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,090
ah

315
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,060
Needlework?

316
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,180
It's very good for you.

317
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,860
yes

318
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,450
As long as I touch

319
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,140
There will be flowers and many butterflies

320
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,100
It's incredible

321
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,650
His Majesty has arrived

322
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,540
Why do you have to come here at this time?

323
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,030
Damn, the noodles will get wet.

324
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,150
It won't taste good.

325
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,900
Very hot

326
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,780
nave

327
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,750
After paying respects to the elders

328
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,370
Would you like to come and see the central hall?

329
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,610
So I came to see you

330
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,770
Was my going out discovered?

331
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,220
How could it be bad?

332
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,240
My Lord, did you have a good time last night?

333
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,630
Let's change the subject

334
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,590
You're changing the subject.

335
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,060
Thanks to you

336
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,110
But have you been drinking?

337
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,590
Me?

338
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,270
How is it possible?

339
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,700
You didn't drink it, did you?

340
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,620
Want to cross-eyed?

341
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,340
Are you such a good liar?

342
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,650
Oh, sorry, sorry.

343
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,010
I'm not such an impolite person.

344
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,690
But you got too close

345
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,770
That's all I have to say.

346
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,200
I'm too busy so I'll leave first

347
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,920
Your Highness

348
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,880
Let's go to Xuanzheng Hall

349
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,120
It's your highness

350
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,310
Impossible government affairs are busy

351
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,760
What are you busy doing?

352
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,820
The noodles are all soaked

353
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,490
Greetings to you, Your Majesty

354
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,340
Big Brother

355
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,270
Is there any smell on my face?

356
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,690
Please come closer and smell it.

357
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,900
Taste?

358
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,230
have no idea

359
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,930
Get something ready

360
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,570
What did she eat?

361
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,690
Shameless

362
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,960
Madam, Master Jin Bingren is here

363
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,020
Cousin

364
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,960
Thanks to you last night

365
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,280
I just did what I was supposed to do.

366
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,500
When guests come, we should serve them some tea and fruit.

367
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,700
I miss you so much

368
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,350
Why is it so corny?

369
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,710
Hey, just deal with it.

370
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,060
I miss you too

371
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,020
It's a blessing

372
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,410
Listen to you say

373
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,740
All my previous worries disappeared

374
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,640
What's so touching about just one sentence?

375
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,050
I heard that you saw me

376
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,680
Fell into the lake

377
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,910
That day you told me you were scared

378
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,690
What are you saying?

379
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,750
I said so. I was scared.

380
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,710
I'm afraid of

381
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,660
The most terrible thing in this world is people

382
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,060
Have you been threatened?

383
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,470
Cause you to fall into the lake

384
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,760
The person who wants to kill you

385
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,400
Last night

386
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,640
Who is the person who wants to harm you?

387
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,510
Did you know

388
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,480
Wait a moment

389
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,720
I know about the lake.

390
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,260
The person who wanted to harm me last night

391
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,260
What does it mean?

392
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,600
Don't you remember?

393
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,500
An assassin tried to kill you yesterday.

394
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,440
Assassin?

395
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,930
Does that mean I almost died?

396
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,630
Who wants to kill me?

397
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,850
There is something I thought you knew.

398
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,210
But you don't seem to know

399
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,760
What?

400
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,260
Twice in a row

401
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,500
Does anyone want to kill me?

402
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,730
This woman is dangerous.

403
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,630
There's a day when I might fall into the lake with you

404
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,850
What you said made you

405
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
It's related to the things you're afraid of.

406
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,100
It seems you don't know yet

407
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,660
My memory is not complete

408
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,380
What did you say?

409
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,240
You should know better than me

410
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,780
What happened that day

411
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Can't you really remember?

412
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,340
yes

413
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,880
I can't remember anything

414
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,460
This is not important

415
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,260
The one who wants to kill me...

416
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,060
Those guys from the no-sweat party

417
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,030
What did you do to me?

418
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,830
You were almost killed.

419
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
Look at the enemy's swordsmanship level

420
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,340
The quality of the clothes

421
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,950
Not an ordinary person

422
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,160
Although I don't know how many people there are

423
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,440
There are other helpers

424
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,310
If it weren't for you, I'd be dead

425
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,900
I was so lucky to meet you yesterday.

426
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,240
oops

427
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,640
you

428
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,410
Why did you leave the palace yesterday?

429
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,320
I just felt too bored so I went out for a drive.

430
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,600
If the Queen knew

431
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,270
My leaving the palace

432
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,880
Things will get bigger

433
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,680
Not only will you be monitored, but you will also be unable to move.

434
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,320
Honglian will also be beheaded.

435
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,350
Is it possible that only the two of us know

436
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,700
Just let it go.

437
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,450
But we have to find the criminal.

438
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,850
You can check secretly.

439
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,050
Because I'll be in trouble.

440
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,780
Okay?

441
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,080
knew

442
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,130
Who knows that you left the palace?

443
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,750
Only Honglian knows

444
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,010
I will send someone to monitor Honglian

445
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
oops

446
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,140
Honglian only needs one word from me

447
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,140
Are willing to die

448
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,640
Don't mind her.

449
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,690
Niangniang

450
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,610
You can't trust anyone from now on.

451
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,760
Although I have known her for a long time

452
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,060
The people around you may be the most terrible

453
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,960
Even in the palace

454
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,330
Can't say it's safe here.

455
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,260
No

456
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,330
Maybe the palace is more dangerous.

457
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,930
yes

458
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,900
I forgot what kind of place this is.

459
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,970
A palace full of conspiracy

460
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,250
Life expectancy

461
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,570
Comparable to the battlefield

462
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,560
A dangerous place

463
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,150
Don't be too scared

464
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,630
I will protect the lady

465
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,260
Thank you for saying that.

466
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,320
I have to protect myself

467
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,010
Now is not the time to play

468
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,610
You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me

469
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,310
Even if you forgot

470
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,890
I will never forget

471
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,170
Like a brand engraved in my heart

472
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,540
Memories of that night

473
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,050
I will find those guys.

474
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,970
(Business of All Things)

475
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,660
There are from the Qing Dynasty

476
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,860
The place of silk thread

477
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,090
Is this the place?

478
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,330
Hello

479
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,140
I heard there are precious items from the Qing Dynasty here.

480
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,710
It spreads so fast.

481
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,810
This way please

482
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,070
Such a precious thing

483
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,160
Put it in such a messy place?

484
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,970
It's because it's so precious.

485
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,530
for you

486
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,940
What's this

487
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,460
This is

488
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,370
Close one eye

489
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,570
that's all

490
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,300
Just watch

491
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,360
Hello

492
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,550
Is anyone there?

493
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,740
In

494
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,720
You seem to have misunderstood

495
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,200
I just want the silk thread from the Qing Dynasty

496
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,440
I just want the thread

497
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,270
How to use such a strange bucket

498
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,330
Kim Byung-in

499
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,220
Didn't you tell me not to trust anyone?

500
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,410
How can I trust him?

501
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,000
Is it really about Honglian...

502
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,410
still

503
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,900
Do you like it?

504
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,560
One week is too long

505
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,200
If this goes on, I'll die without even knowing the reason.

506
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,680
Do what I'm good at.

507
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,290
Taming with food

508
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,410
My food can penetrate even armor

509
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,300
The King and Queen will definitely be able to win

510
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,530
Wait a moment

511
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,140
This may be

512
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,460
Meals delivered to the Queen Mother's Palace?

513
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,740
Yes, lady.

514
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,660
let me see

515
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,610
Meals used in the palace

516
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,400
Health status can be seen

517
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,890
No random inspection

518
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,370
Send it over.

519
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,640
What am I doing? I am the middle temple.

520
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,130
Although I'm sorry

521
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Everyone calls me the boss.

522
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,540
This means I'm the boss in the kitchen.

523
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,210
Then prove it with your strength.

524
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,180
Who is the boss here?

525
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,720
What are you talking about

526
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,140
I'm going to start preparing the meal. Take your time.

527
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,100
Is it because you are afraid of losing?

528
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,690
Lost to me who only imitated cooking

529
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,890
Okay, the imperial meal is being prepared...

530
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,030
Empress of the Middle Temple

531
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,640
Empress of the Middle Temple

532
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,360
The Queen Mother's Experienced Leader

533
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,820
Experienced leader Experienced leader...

534
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:18,920
Experienced leader Experienced leader...

535
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,770
Really

536
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,450
food

537
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,170
Although speed is important, taste

538
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,280
Taste is also important

539
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,260
That's right

540
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,320
you

541
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,090
Are you talking about me?

542
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,420
You are wearing different clothes, so you are not from the imperial kitchen.

543
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,450
Where do you belong?

544
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,190
yes

545
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,270
The slaves belong to

546
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,640
The World Games Pavilion manages tributes

547
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,820
Du Xueyong

548
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,320
You come to taste

549
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,710
Me?

550
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,140
This place is full of this uncle's minions.

551
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,120
Can you give a good evaluation when you are all looking at my face?

552
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,080
Come on over here

553
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,970
It's the queen

554
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,740
So

555
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,280
So far

556
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,800
I haven't tasted this before

557
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,550
hot pot

558
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,170
Not only is the name beautiful, it also makes people happy

559
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,270
Of all the flavors I've tasted in my life

560
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,020
This excellent...

561
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,270
Who are you?

562
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,110
Dare

563
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,800
How dare that little girl enter the imperial kitchen?

564
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,240
Stinky girl

565
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,320
You just said that to me, right?

566
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,530
Call me a stinky girl

567
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,240
Dare to enter the imperial kitchen

568
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,610
that

569
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,890
How is it possible?

570
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,080
Niangniang

571
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,280
OK

572
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm faster

573
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,050
The taste is not as good as mine

574
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,800
At least when I came

575
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,970
I'm the boss here.

576
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,010
Everyone needs to help me

577
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,020
It's the queen

578
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,210
That guy

579
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,280
after

580
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,390
Watch this little girl and learn from her

581
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,470
Got it?

582
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,280
Niangniang

583
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,790
Now, Your Majesty

584
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,050
Went to the Dazao Temple

585
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,320
Why are you here so early today?

586
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,820
miss you

587
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,940
Today is so funny

588
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,130
Now it's time to go to the other palace.

589
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,470
Special Forces

590
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,840
What

591
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,840
Do you have anything to say about this word?

592
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,420
Is it word chain?

593
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,150
Soldiers

594
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,680
Disappear now immediately

595
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,610
Cook

596
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,280
Soldiers

597
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,360
After all, he is the king.

598
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,400
I said this too much.

599
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,460
Will he be beheaded?

600
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,620
Tell me

601
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,970
nonsense

602
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,270
Talking rudely without any clue

603
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,940
It seems that I have a lot of dissatisfaction with the world.

604
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,570
Tell me all your complaints today.

605
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,910
I won't go to the palace today.

606
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,100
No, no, I'm not dissatisfied.

607
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,970
recent

608
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,590
I'm still wondering if there is a more perfect time in life than this?

609
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,200
Didn't you see anyone today?

610
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,270
What do you want to know?

611
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,770
How much did you hear?

612
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,670
Just want to know your daily routine

613
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,440
I'll leave after chatting for a while.

614
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,730
My cousin came over.

615
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,630
My cousin's words

616
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,730
Is his name Kim Byung-in?

617
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,400
Because of what

618
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,840
Why am I now

619
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,880
There is a feeling of being interrogated

620
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,860
You are too sensitive.

621
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,150
Did something happen to your relatives?

622
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,580
Because I'm worried.

623
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,670
Nothing

624
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,070
Just came to congratulate the national wedding

625
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,990
That way I'll be relieved.

626
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,750
but

627
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,610
Why do you hate me so much lately?

628
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,470
She knew the assassin was me.

629
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,250
Is that why you are so hostile to me?

630
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,720
After all, you're married.

631
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,870
Even though they were in a very loving relationship

632
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,560
I will hate it even after I get married.

633
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,140
Now it's ok

634
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,670
Let's go

635
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:29,970
Visitors

636
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,290
quilt pillow

637
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,350
What's wrong with what we agreed on?

638
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,140
After chatting and laughing, I found that I was tired

639
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,650
I don't have the strength to walk to Xizheng Hall.

640
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,040
As expected

641
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,110
Strong during the day and weak at night

642
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,090
Anyway it's weird

643
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,540
Anyway it's weird

644
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,300
Niangniang

645
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,120
Can't trust anyone now

646
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,680
yes

647
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,070
This guy is the most unbelievable

648
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,780
Since ancient times, whenever

649
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,120
The strongest suspect in his wife's murder

650
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,100
It's the husband

651
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,360
Who knows what he will say in his sleep?

652
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,070
Will you do something while I'm asleep?

653
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,740
Can't sleep

654
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,170
Can't

655
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,810
Can't

656
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,780
Can't

657
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,570
Can't

658
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,250
Can't

659
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,180
Can't

660
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,170
Hello

661
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,080
that

662
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,040
What's wrong

663
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm going to die if this continues

664
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,080
Hey, hey, hey, wake up, wake up

665
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,460
Wake up, wake up

666
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,660
Huazhen

667
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,140
You saved me again

668
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,740
Thank you

669
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,340
Are you crazy? This is

670
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,900
hateful

671
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:16,600
Huazhen

672
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,500
nave

673
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,150
Can you die if you hit me like this?

674
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,640
If I leave it alone, I feel like I'm going to die.

675
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,980
I don't know how much I struggled.

676
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,400
It seems I called

677
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,620
The other women's names were typed.

678
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,850
Don't take it to heart

679
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,620
That kind of thing has nothing to do with me.

680
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,680
Follow me

681
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,220
Don't touch, okay?

682
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,520
This sentence again

683
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,350
Now that you're awake

684
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,350
Either go back to Xizheng Palace or go to another palace

685
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,600
Have a good night's sleep

686
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,240
Okay?

687
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,160
If you start walking early in the morning

688
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,490
The servants will suffer.

689
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,650
What a saint!

690
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,970
Thank you for the compliment from the Central Palace

691
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,560
nave

692
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,660
Is this too much?

693
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
What a great strength!

694
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,000
Sleep quietly and go after you wake up

695
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,760
concession

696
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,810
It is also the virtue of the Holy King.

697
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,880
The strange thing is that as long as you sleep in the Dazao Hall for one night

698
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,960
The body will feel uncomfortable

699
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,200
So our sleeping together ends here.

700
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,670
It's because I'm not familiar with this place.

701
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,840
It is better to stay until you are familiar with it.

702
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,070
I don't want to be affected by your nightmares.

703
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:12,920
Forced to wake up

704
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,890
Nightmare I don't know

705
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,740
But I remember

706
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,570
Because I called another woman's name

707
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,830
And was awakened

708
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,280
I tonight

709
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,540
must

710
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:24,860
Will definitely

711
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,060
Call your name

712
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,420
I'm losing my appetite now.

713
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,480
If you don't want to eat, just clean up the imperial meal. I'm a bit busy.

714
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,630
Why are you so busy?

715
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,160
Ditch Girl

716
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,930
No phone number here

717
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,010
No social media either

718
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,360
I can only go on stage with this body.

719
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,560
Love Pure Love Hand

720
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,570
Love Pure Love Hand

721
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,050
Love is pure

722
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,920
Through pleasing means

723
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,210
I'll do this to you tonight

724
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,750
Bullseye

725
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,600
pretty

726
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,050
When will you learn this?

727
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,880
Very ashamed

728
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,290
Then I also

729
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,390
Show off your skills

730
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,880
that

731
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,690
I happened to

732
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,780
I consummated my marriage with my master.

733
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,190
Actually, the round house is not real

734
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,500
But pretend to consummate the marriage

735
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,570
You should know that he went to the other palace the day before yesterday.

736
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,560
But I don't know what I was planning yesterday.

737
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,190
He refused to go to another palace.

738
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,360
But don't worry

739
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,730
Nothing happened all night.

740
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,810
It will be the same in the future

741
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,610
Must

742
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,170
Did you meet me just to say this?

743
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,630
Not that one

744
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,670
Is he really the real culprit in the lake case?

745
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,020
The second time too?

746
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,160
If yes

747
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,170
Please wait a few days.

748
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,330
I am the type who cannot stand being disliked by beautiful women.

749
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,000
So I hope you don't hate me

750
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,270
Is the wind blowing in the wrong direction this time?

751
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,200
Anyway

752
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:35,980
Just believe what I say

753
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,920
Wait a few days

754
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,820
You know I'm in this palace.

755
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,730
Who is the most unbelievable person?

756
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,330
It is you, the Queen Mother.

757
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,230
besides

758
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,080
Everything I just said

759
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,450
I won't believe it

760
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,730
so

761
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,710
If you are trying to drive a wedge between me and His Majesty

762
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,320
Then please give up

763
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,140
I'm totally an angel lately.

764
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,400
Don't you know I've completely changed?

765
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,840
It's getting scarier.

766
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,000
Acting very kindly in front of

767
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,980
I was accused of falling into the lake behind my back.

768
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,810
I didn't make any false accusations.

769
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,770
I just don't know who the criminal is.

770
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,630
Just from the location

771
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,800
You will be more suspicious.

772
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,130
Madam, you know the criminal.

773
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,930
The prisoner is

774
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,120
Madam, you yourself

775
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,230
My lady, you fell into the water on purpose.

776
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,800
To throw dirty water on me

777
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,090
Look how angry she is.

778
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,430
It shouldn't be a lie.

779
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,540
That cold look

780
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,960
Now I know the reason

781
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,610
The main culprit of the drowning incident

782
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,830
Now I'm the only one left

783
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,650
one way or another

784
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,910
Someone is watching me.

785
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,510
It hasn't changed

786
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,180
Niangniang

787
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,820
Now let's go back to the main hall.

788
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,130
Choi Sang-Gong, please go to the main hall first.

789
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,220
If something goes wrong

790
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,210
Just deal with it roughly

791
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,650
Let Honglian come and tell me

792
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,090
That won't work.

793
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,410
This is the way to save me.

794
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,160
Please

795
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,500
here here here

796
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,010
Waiting for experienced people

797
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,520
How many meals are served in the main hall each day?

798
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,360
I'm not sure how many times.

799
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,160
Anyway, several times

800
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,840
I wasn't going to say this.

801
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,960
There are many experienced people who want to prepare the meal for the emperor.

802
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,600
Early morning meal and breakfast

803
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,110
Evening dinner, noon daytime bed

804
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,950
And have a few snacks in between

805
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,550
Will you eat these?

806
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,770
Snack once every three or four days

807
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:14,290
At that time, honey and ginger are usually added.

808
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,710
Look at the plate that was taken down.

809
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,390
A lot of food is wasted

810
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,360
But it didn't say it won't be used anymore.

811
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,540
That means you want to hide it.

812
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,930
He is stronger than

813
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,870
Still mainly for viewing

814
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,630
Aren’t these all good looking?

815
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,150
Is the sound of gunpowder limited to this?

816
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,720
Louder

817
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,340
Our Military Minister should not be frightened.

818
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:53,810
Where are you touching?

819
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,280
but

820
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,090
Arrange to directly guard His Majesty's presence

821
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,670
This is the Imperial Army.

822
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,310
This Royal Army

823
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,230
Not the military.

824
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,120
It is called

825
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,540
Imperial symbol

826
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,350
According to such picky instructions

827
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,240
It's all here

828
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,130
I don't like busy things.

829
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,360
What about things?

830
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,070
Tonight

831
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,900
Is that so?

832
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,620
It's the powder from poisonous mushrooms.

833
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,680
Airless

834
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,520
colorless

835
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,320
When mixed in water, it becomes completely invisible.

836
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,420
but

837
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,750
If the middle temple knows something

838
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,260
How can it be so quiet?

839
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,470
What is being prepared behind the scenes?

840
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,800
Maybe it's waiting for the right time.

841
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,910
Need to confirm

842
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,620
The Yongping-kun Incident

843
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,110
There's not much hope.

844
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,770
Always by the Lord's side

845
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,710
night

846
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,380
Guards and Eunuchs

847
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,770
Split people in half

848
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,500
The training general is really

849
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,790
Still full of bad beauty

850
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,160
Anyway, the Imperial Army is notoriously useless.

851
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,780
I feel like it would be better to just leave it like that.

852
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,560
I won't talk about my father and brother.

853
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,070
I grew up in front of my mother and grandmother.

854
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,840
He must have received a very good education.

855
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,240
but

856
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,300
The uncle

857
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:42,850
(Father-in-law of the monarch)
The uncle

858
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:42,980
(Father-in-law of the monarch)

859
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,970
When are you going to arrange for General Jin?
(Father-in-law of the monarch)

860
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:45,060
When are you going to arrange for General Jin?

861
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,280
Any questions?

862
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,840
After giving the information

863
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,480
I know how to measure myself.

864
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,320
Are you trying to steal military rations again?

865
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,440
You should be more appropriate

866
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,180
Shaking the military is the most dangerous thing.

867
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,860
How many times do I have to say this?

868
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,470
yes

869
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,250
I won't let it cause any problems

870
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,330
Anyway

871
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,570
I feel like there are dangerous guys walking around outside the palace.

872
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,620
What does this mean?

873
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,040
I was on my way to Uttarakhand two days ago

874
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,420
Did you go to Utah Pavilion two days ago?

875
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,400
yes

876
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,020
I met a new colleague

877
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,110
His name is excellent too.

878
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,350
Li Shengli

879
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,500
Li Shengli

880
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,670
Is that a name you recognize?

881
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,490
no

882
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,750
Look at this, it sounds familiar for some reason.

883
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,640
It should be famous

884
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,730
The children of the four major departments

885
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,620
It's the first time I heard the name

886
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:48,440
But I was walking towards Uttarakhand with him.

887
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,220
I was at a loss, who

888
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,030
I fainted from the shock.

889
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,900
After cheering up

890
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,700
This is Li Shengrui's colleague.

891
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,250
Magically disappeared

892
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,680
Do you remember what Li Shengqi was wearing?

893
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,620
Of course

894
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:10,470
Is it the same fabric as this one?

895
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:17,800
No

896
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:22,970
I see

897
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,990
If you see your missing friend again

898
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,770
Anyway, let me know about him.

899
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,420
This word

900
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,230
Are you assigning me a special mission?

901
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,380
It's not a special mission.

902
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,730
you

903
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,010
I guess everything will be fine after we go into the palace together tomorrow.

904
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,890
What do you mean by having nothing to do?

905
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
Say hello to everyone you know

906
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,860
The day is almost over.

907
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,750
There is something that is just right for you

908
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,100
A true special mission

909
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,390
Finally

910
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:23,180
(No Touch)

911
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,140
(No Touch)

912
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,380
Your Highness

913
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,750
Yongping Jun is here

914
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,970
Um

915
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,500
Do you know what this means?

916
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:46,700
What

917
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,460
Let's take a closer look

918
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,600
No Touch

919
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,220
This is in the mouth of the nave

920
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,370
It means living happily together

921
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,660
Where is this word used?

922
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,680
This is the first time I've heard this in my life.

923
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,500
Could it be words from the North?

924
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,930
I want to have a cup of tea with you.

925
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,320
It is good

926
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,530
In the strange words spoken in the nave

927
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:41,900
I am thinking hard, is there any meaning in this?

928
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,020
yes

929
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,110
This is what you mentioned before

930
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,280
Thanks for your hard work

931
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,550
Is it today?

932
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,010
The sooner the better

933
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:00,430
That's right

934
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,600
Glue a little more here.

935
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,090
No matter what, it's the Queen's order.

936
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,330
Make such a mess of the stove

937
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,650
Not a mess, but an upgrade

938
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,650
This is like a fool again.

939
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,640
That stupid person

940
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,980
Hurry up and take that stone.

941
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,920
How heavy?

942
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,780
I'll help

943
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,130
This stone is nice.

944
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,690
This might be too big.

945
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,800
no

946
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,680
Niangniang

947
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:39,660
Is it oil?

948
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,090
yes

949
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,040
I followed the instructions

950
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,120
Whether it is sesame oil, sesame oil, cooking oil

951
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,850
All swept over.

952
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,120
Well done Well done

953
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,030
Such a precious thing

954
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:54,950
Niangniang

955
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,720
This is a year's worth of oil.

956
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,420
The cooking depends on the ingredients.

957
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,360
This is a dish that concerns my destiny.

958
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:03,630
Niangniang

959
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,590
The Lord said that we should eat in the main hall

960
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,640
It's been a long time

961
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,540
Just say I'm being filial.

962
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,490
this this this

963
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,680
All fallen down. All fallen down.

964
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,250
All the precious materials were taken away.

965
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,210
What are you going to do?

966
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,780
I just took them and didn't care what she did.

967
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,650
Precious things are also for the Holy Lord.

968
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,110
What are you worried about?

969
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,540
What are you doing with this ice fish?

970
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:56,580
That is really precious.

971
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,200
OK

972
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,470
very good

973
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,830
Well done Well done

974
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,070
Then this

975
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:12,780
yes

976
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,190
Put this in

977
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:14,780
What

978
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,170
Let you put it in.

979
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:16,950
It's the queen

980
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,410
OK

981
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,910
All the precious things will be burned.

982
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,010
That that that

983
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,990
So rare

984
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,250
Your Highness

985
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,360
The servant is really terrified

986
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,400
The Queen prepared the meal for the Queen Mother herself.

987
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,950
No eating for now

988
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,740
I see

989
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,490
I'll wait a little longer then.

990
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,050
I am really terrified, Your Highness.

991
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,410
Are you avoiding the chance to be with me?

992
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,680
Are you okay?

993
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,540
Fell asleep immediately.

994
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,550
My fate depends on you.

995
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,150
There will be some pain

996
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,160
Report it

997
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,760
Didn't I tell you not to serve dinner today?

998
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,840
This was made by the Queen Mother herself.

999
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,280
Does the central hall cook?

1000
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,200
It's the queen

1001
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,170
Since last night

1002
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,690
Made by staying up late

1003
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,160
This is really grateful.

1004
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,820
What on earth is this made of?

1005
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,800
Looks very strange

1006
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,550
Beef, pork and fish

1007
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,740
Cooked together

1008
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,210
Not like a diet

1009
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,130
Like a piece of porcelain

1010
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,790
Although I really have no appetite

1011
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,870
But we all stayed up late

1012
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,180
For the sake of this sincerity

1013
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,610
Just take a bite

1014
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,390
No answer yet?

1015
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,550
yes

1016
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:18,930
No, I have to go see it myself.

1017
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,590
The Queen Mother has arrived

1018
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,070
success

1019
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,110
How can this be?

1020
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,260
fail

1021
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,110
Have you been hiding your shortcomings?

1022
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,520
What

1023
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,950
I don't know how long it has been since I last enjoyed food like this.

1024
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,270
The taste is so touching

1025
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,130
I'm gonna be angry.

1026
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,910
Great success

1027
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,840
Fortunately, it suits your taste

1028
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,420
Of course, of course

1029
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,770
If this is the food

1030
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,080
You can eat it every day

1031
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:16,620
How is it done?

1032
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,360
First time trying

1033
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,600
Soft mouthfeel

1034
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,940
Rich in flavor

1035
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,240
Used oil

1036
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,170
Cooking overnight on low heat

1037
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,700
Oiled fish

1038
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,340
Roast in the oven overnight

1039
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,750
Pursue both crispy skin and tender meat

1040
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,470
Compared to the tough meat in a deep fryer

1041
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,170
Cook overnight at low temperature

1042
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,270
This method is more than just taste

1043
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,950
It also retains nutrients to the maximum extent

1044
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,330
A healthy meal that helps your health and youth

1045
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,820
This is French cooking

1046
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,390
What does Gombe mean?

1047
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,440
Not only tastes good but is it also healthy?

1048
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:07,180
Where do you know this method?

1049
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,270
It should be inspiration

1050
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,640
How can I make the Queen Mother happy?

1051
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,390
After thinking about it for a few days and nights, I got it.

1052
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,030
It's time for the last resort

1053
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,990
I will help you every day

1054
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:30,450
Keep you young and healthy forever

1055
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,720
I allow water to be added to the lake

1056
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,150
OK

1057
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,390
When will it be filled?

1058
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,820
Ten days at the earliest

1059
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,400
Fill it up now or I'll chop you off.

1060
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:16,880
Quick, quick, quick...

1061
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,830
This is the amount for two days.

1062
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,310
Stop All

1063
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,700
I have a way

1064
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,410
The water is coming

1065
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:36,910
Give

1066
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,490
There is such a good method

1067
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,350
Good, good, good

1068
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:49,950
Hurry and bring it over here.

1069
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,310
What an innovative approach.

1070
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,060
Before the water fills up

1071
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,890
Don't even think about sleeping.

1072
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,190
Yes Yes

1073
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:31,790
Stigma If that charitable appearance is a false face

1074
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,050
Even if I deceived everyone

1075
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:37,110
You can't fool my sharp eyes.

1076
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,940
It's really an unusual fabric.

1077
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,630
Not yet.

1078
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,480
Know where to sell

1079
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,540
Although there is no

1080
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:08,600
But you can try

1081
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,590
If you don't have the ability, you have to work hard

1082
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,220
This is the way to be a human being

1083
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,710
I appreciate your attitude

1084
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,150
I was worried about not taking good care of the princess.

1085
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,950
Don't worry now

1086
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,700
No other news?

1087
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:35,740
Last night, when the princess stayed up late in the imperial kitchen

1088
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:41,180
His Highness is anxiously waiting for the princess in the Great Hall.

1089
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,880
Ask him to go to bed early but he stubbornly says it's okay

1090
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,270
Your Highness is so anxious, Princess

1091
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,150
Got it?

1092
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:57,760
yes

1093
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,920
If you often have sex, you will fall in love

1094
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,780
The princess made an agreement with me very confidently.

1095
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,140
Agreement?

1096
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:14,180
She said she would let me hold the prince

1097
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,470
Oh finally in our house

1098
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,920
Is the first prince born?

1099
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,210
What's this

1100
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,050
yes

1101
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:28,760
look

1102
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,930
If you eat this, you will grow new flesh

1103
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,260
So precious

1104
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,970
If you feel good after eating it

1105
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:41,230
I'll get it again no matter what method I use

1106
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,620
Thanks

1107
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,470
I didn't know there would be such a good day

1108
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,850
Last time our princess fell into the lake

1109
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:55,330
I feel bad.

1110
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,960
Such an innocent child in such a difficult position

1111
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,770
Doing so well

1112
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,130
I'm in tears

1113
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,550
Speak well

1114
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,190
To be honest, I'm not an innocent child.

1115
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,420
What did our princess say?

1116
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,570
Sensitive

1117
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:17,840
Compared to that

1118
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,430
careful

1119
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,740
Not to describe it more directly.

1120
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,560
direct

1121
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:27,720
mean

1122
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,080
special

1123
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,560
For special children

1124
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,780
It's remarkable.

1125
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,100
Materials for being a mother of the nation

1126
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,400
Yeah yeah

1127
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:42,920
I seem to have seen

1128
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,820
Our Queen Consort's former appearance

1129
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,410
How come?

1130
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,220
Are you crazy? Did you see it with your eyes?

1131
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,280
Did you see it?

1132
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,900
I have seen it with my own eyes in this palace

1133
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,660
Our queen pushes the princess' eyes?

1134
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,090
Do you have to see it to know?

1135
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,510
The news spread throughout the palace.

1136
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,380
Right

1137
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,290
Yeah yeah

1138
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,430
Everyone in this palace knows

1139
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,870
It turns out that I was so excited because I felt guilty.

1140
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:16,230
Is the news spread in vain?

1141
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,220
You will start spreading rumors tomorrow that you are bald.

1142
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:27,740
Crazy Woman

1143
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,470
Let me go, let me go, let me go

1144
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,760
The princess framed her.

1145
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,570
It's time for our queen to be crowned

1146
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,450
Jumped in intentionally

1147
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,770
Know what you say

1148
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,510
Today must

1149
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:27,620
Your Highness, I thought you wanted to practice calligraphy

1150
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:32,250
I wanted to gamble with Hong Biejian before.

1151
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,920
But I saw something amazing

1152
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,960
Fly this short knife in the distance

1153
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:47,000
I think I can too

1154
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:52,040
What should I do if the danger hurts my body?

1155
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,910
How long have you been with me?

1156
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,820
Just over two years

1157
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,920
Yeah

1158
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,570
You figured me out in such a short time.

1159
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,370
Be my hands and feet

1160
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:25,470
It feels like we've been together for a long time.

1161
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,430
Of course, this is my duty.

1162
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,090
certainly

1163
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:35,810
Although responsibility is of course

1164
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,680
But if you look at loyalty, you can see

1165
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:45,890
Is it necessary to do it or is it sincere?

1166
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,940
I can see your sincerity

1167
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,960
Your Majesty,

1168
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,570
Do you believe me?

1169
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,120
I don't believe who else Your Highness can trust.

1170
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,330
It's harder than it looks

1171
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,490
But why don't you believe me?

1172
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,710
Shame...Shame

1173
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,830
As I get older, I become less courageous.

1174
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,980
Go to the Great Hall early today

1175
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,050
I will prepare

1176
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,550
Come back early and finally see it

1177
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,070
More honest than it looks.

1178
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,870
So much effort to share a room

1179
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,140
The wine table is coming

1180
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:17,770
What wine table?

1181
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,070
Doesn't the princess like wine?

1182
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,760
I asked someone to prepare it

1183
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,310
I quit drinking

1184
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,690
I knew it would be like this

1185
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,160
Tea time is here

1186
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,730
This is jasmine tea

1187
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:51,220
Drinking it will make you feel better when you have insomnia or are worried.

1188
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,850
Jasmine tea has a strong flavor

1189
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,850
At that time, I also smelled

1190
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:24,220
The scent on my hands

1191
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,090
It's you

1192
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:02,910
It's you

1193
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:06,450
It's dangerous to show your true feelings casually

1194
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:14,010
Especially in a palace where everyone hides secrets

1195
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,210
More

1196
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,950
(Preview of the next episode)

1197
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,030
Was I deceived by the princess's eyes and words?

1198
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,720
Let him say this too.

1199
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,970
The one who sent this letter was the Queen

1200
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,440
Just wait until the water fills up

1201
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:59,030
Just hold on quietly until that time comes.

1202
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,440
Today we are looking for a palace maid

1203
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:02,430
Be more careful than ever

1204
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,370
Don't reveal your identity

1205
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,260
Found the source of this fabric

1206
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:06,880
Miyasato

1207
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,010
Not me, but the concubine

1208
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:11,860
Wanting to give it back in the same way is revenge.

1209
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,120
What I did to the princess

1210
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,070
Do you think I can't do it?
