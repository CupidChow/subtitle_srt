(This drama is purely fictional and the characters, groups, events, etc. are not related to history)

2
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,120
(Episode 18)

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,130
Wait a moment

4
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,450
Wait a moment

5
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,700
stop

6
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,620
Wait a minute

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,340
Why...

8
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,470
While I was sleeping

9
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,610
Has the Lord come to see me?

10
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,480
Yes, lady.

11
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,570
That's not my dream.

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,330
What happened to him suddenly?

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,900
Like someone being chased by something

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,280
Suddenly there was a civil riot

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,860
That's because he's a little too...

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,850
Don't worry too much, ma'am.

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,970
Yes, His Highness will be back soon.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,040
Yeah.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,310
There must be a reason why he left so quickly.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,510
He doesn't look back at me because he will be back soon.

21
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:22,256
Instead of taking the time to say hello, it's better to go and come back quickly.

22
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:25,076
So that's why

23
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,486
Now that position has changed hands.

24
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,496
It's such a simple thing

25
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,550
This is all thanks to the decisive decision of the Queen Mother

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,800
nave

27
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,740
She was for the little master in her belly

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,630
Abandoning the master and choosing the family

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,070
Then I will do it for the sake of Wang Sun.

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,350
Re-acceptance of the nave

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,190
I will never let the regime waver again.

32
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,810
You better give up.

33
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,960
Give me another bowl.

34
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,170
You eat too much

35
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,730
Humans are indeed highly adaptable animals.

36
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,330
I used to think these dishes were bland.

37
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,390
Now you can taste the original flavor of the ingredients

38
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,880
No matter how much I eat, I'm never full

39
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,810
The more I eat, the hungrier I feel.

40
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,740
It seems that this little one can eat a lot.

41
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,060
I know, I won't eat it.

42
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm really fine. Why do you always see me like this?

43
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,270
Really

44
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,070
I want to go for a walk to help with my food

45
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,760
Let me eat a little more.

46
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,270
This weather is crazy.

47
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,220
This beautiful scenery must be photographed and uploaded

48
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
To understand the Nave

49
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,890
It's not too late

50
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,810
Just do as you say.

51
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,630
No Touch

52
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,430
Zhongdian is indeed my hater

53
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,240
I had a lot of troubles before

54
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,860
Now everything is solved

55
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,700
I told you not to like me anymore.

56
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,340
I like the Central Palace, too.

57
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,240
Even if you are the most vulnerable person in the world

58
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,700
I still like you

59
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,550
Memories come flooding back

60
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,050
It's too dangerous here.

61
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,140
MILF

62
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,260
It almost happened.

63
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,220
The lake is too deadly for me.

64
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,650
So

65
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,330
Today is the first day

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,060
Join me

67
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,360
good

68
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,280
From now on, the nave and I

69
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,000
No more touch

70
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,580
hateful

71
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,080
Why are there memory mines all around?

72
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,700
Why is the palace so empty today?

73
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,360
This is too spacious.

74
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,110
Really

75
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,920
(- Episode 18
- Counterattack of Memory)

76
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,750
Niangniang

77
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,950
Niangniang

78
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,280
The Criminal Court Judge is here

79
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,950
I went to the Dazao Palace but didn't find you.

80
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,340
Did something happen to the Lord?

81
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,580
No

82
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,600
Huh

83
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,110
Blood

84
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,540
You are injured

85
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,210
It's just a minor injury during training.

86
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,730
Although it's a bit late

87
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,610
But I still want to come and congratulate you on your pregnancy

88
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,440
Thanks

89
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,230
Now, even for the little master in my belly

90
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,840
I advise you to reconcile with your family.

91
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,160
I should have told you last time.

92
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,820
It doesn't matter if you let go of my hand

93
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,830
But you can't isolate yourself too much.

94
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,130
This palace

95
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,070
It's hard to survive alone.

96
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,900
Thanks for your advice

97
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,600
But I'm not alone

98
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,990
You should know it very well.

99
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,370
If you need help later

100
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,260
You can hold my hand anytime

101
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,300
You and the little one in your belly

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,240
I will protect it even at the cost of my life.

103
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,890
Recently, the sighs and resentments of the people are too heavy.

104
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,970
This eventually led to the civil unrest

105
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,010
I decided to go and find out the truth myself.

106
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,950
Leave the throne vacant for now

107
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,700
But state affairs are urgent

108
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,100
In my absence

109
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,580
I hope the ministers will follow the instructions of the Queen Mother.

110
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,610
above

111
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,460
This is the royal order left by His Highness.

112
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,110
To make sure I can fill the vacant seat.

113
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,550
Doing politics correctly

114
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,160
I want to adjust your positions first.

115
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,180
Former Left State Councillor Kim Seok-gyun reinstated

116
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,640
Former Military Minister Kim Chang-hyup appointed as the Captain of the Royal Guard

117
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,070
The current captain of the imperial guard, Yongping Jun

118
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,330
Transferred to the Rectification Department as Director

119
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,540
Since the Lord has embarked on a dangerous path

120
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,860
If anyone dares to speak nonsense and damage the reputation of the Lord

121
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,510
I will definitely cut off his three-inch tongue

122
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Our baby

123
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,870
Super cute

124
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,750
What do you want to do?

125
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,360
Do all of them

126
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,700
When my heart is in turmoil

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,230
Best for practicing calligraphy

128
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,210
Baby

129
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,880
You miss your dad too, right?

130
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,930
Tell daddy to come back soon

131
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,390
Hey, he seemed to kick me just now

132
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
Are you answering me?

133
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,480
But it's not time for the fetus to move yet.

134
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,580
It's too early.

135
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,940
Is he a genius?

136
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,190
Oh, what should I do?

137
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,050
Oh, what should I do? My baby seems to be a genius.

138
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,590
Oh, what am I doing now?

139
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,920
Niangniang

140
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,930
I just

141
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,250
Suddenly I had a very ominous premonition

142
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,020
I always feel like I will become one

143
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,840
Like a daughter-controlling father, he makes a fuss about his parents

144
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,480
An extremely ominous premonition

145
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,130
My Lord, so precious

146
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,180
No matter how much fuss is made, it's not surprising

147
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,190
Our young master will definitely be like you, my lady...

148
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,070
What unlucky words did you say?

149
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,050
no

150
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,610
She said my child looks like me

151
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,600
Is it unlucky?

152
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,330
You should take the medicine, madam.

153
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
Drink it

154
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,060
Oh, it's a good drink.

155
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,820
The queen actually calls the young master my child

156
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,590
You did a great job

157
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,740
What kind of medicine can I drink?

158
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,630
Isn't it a drug to prevent miscarriage?

159
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,400
It's a drug to prevent Alzheimer's disease

160
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,820
Why do I feel like I drank smart soup?

161
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,050
My mind never rested for a moment.

162
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,170
Memories keep coming back to my mind

163
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,200
I can't sleep at all

164
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,370
He is Cheoljong

165
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,760
CJ

166
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,120
Did you really embroider this last night?

167
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
No wonder everyone likes embroidery so much.

168
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,530
When my hands are busy, all distracting thoughts disappear

169
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,480
Really good

170
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,840
You're so skilled.

171
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,030
The embroidery is so beautiful

172
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,020
This is silk from Jinju, Gyeongsang Province.

173
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,130
Like today's cool morning and evening weather

174
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,930
It's best to wear it around your neck

175
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,770
Your Majesty will definitely like it.

176
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,370
No, I embroidered this for myself.

177
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,760
I've been sitting for so long that my body is a little stiff.

178
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,090
Let's play a fun game

179
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,000
It's the queen

180
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,920
Correct answer

181
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,840
Lord

182
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,590
Over there

183
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,710
Shangshan

184
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,710
I guessed right.

185
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,150
Your Highness, the Lord, served by the Imperial Kitchen

186
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,990
The answer is Shangshanla Niangniang

187
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,210
Yeah

188
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,680
I thought

189
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,150
Next

190
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,500
Lord

191
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,430
Lord

192
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,640
Lord

193
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,400
These questions are too simple.

194
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,900
As pitiful as a stray dog

195
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,910
Lord

196
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,900
Niangniang

197
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,670
Do you really miss His Highness that much?

198
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,670
Why

199
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,880
Once so loving

200
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,840
No, why are you crying?

201
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,310
What's wrong?

202
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,560
Oh, no fun

203
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,300
Give me the needle and thread

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
Madam, are you okay?

205
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,790
No

206
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,350
Not good at all

207
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,680
It hurts so much

208
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,570
Why does a needle hurt so much?

209
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,550
Blame it on hormones

210
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,850
Because I'm pregnant, I'm worried

211
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,570
Tears are increasing

212
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,720
This isn't what I want.

213
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,140
It's the hormones.

214
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,560
I

215
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,490
I'm so heartbroken

216
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,860
I feel like my heart is being strangled

217
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,440
Niangniang

218
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,100
what to do

219
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,810
What's wrong with me?

220
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,720
The body is still being searched for.

221
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,740
Wait a moment.

222
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
Can't wait any longer

223
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,900
If the Lord is still alive

224
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,530
Then we have to hurry up.

225
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,250
I want to inform the Lord about this.

226
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,130
You go get ready

227
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,370
yes

228
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,460
I want to fully arm myself

229
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,320
Never cry again

230
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,350
I was scared to death

231
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,850
Niangniang

232
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,600
I was so scared that my child almost came out of bed

233
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,510
How can you say such a thing?

234
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,080
Niangniang

235
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,460
What's wrong? It's disturbing.

236
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,080
Is the Lord injured?

237
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,080
His Highness

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,600
His Highness

239
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,040
drive

240
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,580
Died

241
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,660
if

242
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,250
I didn't fall asleep

243
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,490
His Highness

244
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,420
Died

245
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,530
if

246
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,870
I kept you

247
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,530
Hyperplex

248
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,260
Hyperplex

249
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,950
Hyperplex

250
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,920
If I hadn't come here

251
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,160
If we hadn't met

252
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,220
you

253
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,880
Should still be alive

254
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,630
(Five days before the enthronement ceremony)
Should still be alive

255
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,670
(Five days before the enthronement ceremony)

256
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,050
What is the upper position?
(Five days before the enthronement ceremony)

257
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,060
What is the upper position?

258
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,220
(The eunuch who served the deceased king
A ceremony held in the hope that the king's soul will return)
What is the upper position?

259
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,850
(The eunuch who served the deceased king
A ceremony held in the hope that the king's soul will return)

260
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,290
Calling back the deceased king
(The eunuch who served the deceased king
A ceremony held in the hope that the king's soul will return)

261
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:08,660
Calling back the deceased king

262
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,270
What a terrible thing to say.

263
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,770
Besides, the body has not been found yet.

264
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,650
So rebirth is a very scary thing.

265
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,390
I really want to put the new master on the throne right now

266
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,170
But if you violate it, you have to wait five days

267
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,110
The custom of resurrecting a deceased king

268
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,400
There will definitely be political opposition in the future.

269
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,550
Even if the Lord is still alive

270
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,990
I can't go back to the palace.

271
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,020
Until the enthronement ceremony is over

272
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,770
I will seal the palace gates

273
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,110
Too

274
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,700
As long as we can hold on for these five days and successfully complete the enthronement ceremony

275
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,650
He is no longer the king.

276
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,690
Even if I kill him, it cannot be considered as treason.

277
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,590
How long will it take to wait in the middle hall?

278
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,620
Has she ever thought about reconciling with her family?

279
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,530
I will talk to her and cheer her up as soon as possible.

280
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,180
Let her come to see you

281
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,990
(Prenatal Education Diary)

282
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,170
What's the use of these

283
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,680
You are no longer here

284
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,890
child

285
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,070
Don't be too sensitive to the taste of food

286
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,450
You made your mother feel bad.

287
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,140
You can have fun during the day

288
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,830
When your mother is sleeping

289
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,170
You need to be quiet for a while

290
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,350
I hope you were born

291
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,430
To prevent your mother from feeling pain

292
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,190
Born as soon as possible

293
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,640
The most important thing is to be born safely and healthily.

294
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,750
I'm looking forward to it

295
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,300
The day we can meet happily

296
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,090
The moment you were born

297
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,450
I will definitely be by your side

298
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,580
Even if this world feels strange to you

299
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,940
Don't be too scared

300
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,940
Please observe etiquette

301
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,660
Did you want to do this from the beginning?

302
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,390
Your Highness already knew there would be such a danger

303
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,580
But to save you

304
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,840
Still risking his life to leave the palace

305
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,640
What's the meaning

306
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,960
Put Yongping Jun in prison immediately

307
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,480
Niangniang

308
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,580
do what

309
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,330
Why vent your anger on the Queen Mother?

310
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,560
The one who took away the Lord's life was the Eastern Bandit

311
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,850
The rebels who couldn't even cut off their leader's head

312
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,520
How dare you attack the king?

313
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Do you think I will believe what you say?

314
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,460
The one who murdered His Highness was Kim Byung-in.

315
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,210
Your soldiers

316
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,600
With you

317
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,060
The life of the nagisa who led His Highness to death

318
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,510
I took it myself

319
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
no

320
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,540
Niangniang

321
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,570
For the little prince in the queen's belly

322
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,920
Please don't do this.

323
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,250
Our lady knows nothing.

324
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,850
Please

325
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,900
Please

326
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,080
Please

327
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,580
Niangniang

328
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,230
Put him in jail

329
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,920
How are you

330
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,510
What does he mean?

331
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,250
The soldiers killed His Highness

332
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,270
You all should go out.

333
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,540
Niangniang

334
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,450
fine

335
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,020
yes

336
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,570
When misfortune strikes, I need someone to blame

337
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,350
These are all Yongping Jun's delusions.

338
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,970
Don't worry

339
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,640
Why should Yongping Jun be imprisoned?

340
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,030
Found Yongping Jun

341
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,950
The Eastern bandits who infiltrated the Imperial Guard Camp were dismissed.

342
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,660
They also hid their true identities.

343
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,520
Because of the accident that happened to His Highness

344
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,660
About them

345
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,450
So I want to investigate Yongping Jun

346
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,210
But it's still a step too late

347
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,550
What are you talking about?

348
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,690
It's as if Yongping Jun killed His Highness.

349
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,690
There must be someone in the palace colluding with the Eastern bandits.

350
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,270
The information about His Highness leaving the palace has been leaked.

351
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,780
It is definitely a person who can master

352
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,780
Positions of His Highness's Marching Route

353
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,710
Yongping Jun is the most suspicious

354
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,010
Are you sure that His Highness was killed by the Eastern Bandits?

355
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,620
Madam, you need to pay attention to something more important than that.

356
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,850
Now I can protect the queen and the little prince in her belly.

357
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,410
Only family

358
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,460
Don't worry about the trivial things

359
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,440
I have to make peace with the Queen Mother right now.

360
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,160
If you miss the opportunity

361
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,650
I can never restore the relationship with my family.

362
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,200
oops

363
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,510
Why

364
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,150
In my next life, I want to be Yongping Jun

365
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,790
If it's that simple to get evidence

366
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,060
What a tiring job.

367
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,710
Everyone is here

368
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,480
No matter what

369
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,910
Gathering in a brothel during a national mourning is a bit

370
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,100
I did my best to prepare for you.

371
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,170
A comfortable occasion

372
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,360
Here

373
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,670
Can we have a frank conversation?

374
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,330
The Lord's Death

375
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,190
It is something worth celebrating for us.

376
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,570
Drink it

377
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,080
What should we do when the thugs are so rampant?

378
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,810
The future of North Korea is worrying.

379
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,140
If this continues

380
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,800
No one can guarantee that the Eastern bandits will not attack Hanyang

381
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,740
If that's the case, everyone here

382
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,110
It's hard to live in peace

383
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,730
So in the future, whether it is the palace or the Hanyang capital

384
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,740
How about blocking everything?

385
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,480
Issue an extraordinary order to strictly control entry and exit

386
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,050
Put all the suspicious people in jail

387
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,060
Take this opportunity to eliminate all the Eastern bandits.

388
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,150
What a great idea

389
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,070
The middle temple is a little crazy now.

390
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,020
When was she normal?

391
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,890
I thought I could gain power just by getting pregnant.

392
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,810
So arrogant

393
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,620
But the Lord became like that

394
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,310
It must have been a blow.

395
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,970
If a legitimate son is born

396
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,610
Instead, it killed his life

397
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,450
You are right

398
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,750
It's time to change the candles and incense

399
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,260
My lady, you will kill me.

400
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,320
Not a living person either.

401
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,360
Then protect the dead.

402
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,130
Shangshan, do you think that's normal?

403
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
You hold on tight.

404
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,290
Thanks

405
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,460
The jade body was badly injured

406
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,820
Especially his dragon face

407
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,100
The miserable ones are hard to recognize.

408
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,970
correct answer

409
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,740
You guys

410
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,440
I am not guilty

411
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,900
The more crimes the guy has, the louder the voice

412
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,760
Your sin

413
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,780
The crime of losing dozens of guns

414
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,590
I was made to bear such an ignominious reputation.

415
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,610
There are no stupid soldiers who lose their guns.

416
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,460
Here

417
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,340
That stupid soldier.

418
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,840
The gun warehouse was emptied

419
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,470
The Sin of Yongping

420
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,730
Doesn't seem curious

421
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,870
Don't worry

422
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,630
Won't stay here long.

423
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,740
no

424
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,650
no

425
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,960
If you don't stay long

426
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,020
no

427
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,630
death penalty

428
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,030
I can stay longer

429
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,680
I am suitable for sleeping on the floor.

430
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,740
Where to go...

431
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,710
That's right

432
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,390
us

433
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,830
Can be unlocked through adequate dialogue

434
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,950
Kim Byung-in used me as bait

435
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,370
Sent Cheoljong to quell the civil unrest and planned to kill him

436
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,820
But prepare a fake corpse

437
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,970
It means that the plan has changed

438
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,930
So the ministers who helped Cheoljong return were imprisoned.

439
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,920
Really

440
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,400
I couldn't concentrate because of the two people crying.

441
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,640
Get closer

442
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,550
yes

443
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,020
I'm going to tell you a secret from now on

444
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,030
It takes two people to carry it to the grave.

445
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,470
OK

446
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,340
His Majesty the Lord

447
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,800
Still alive

448
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,870
Of course, of course.

449
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,570
His Highness

450
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,760
Live in my heart at all times

451
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,680
Your Highness...

452
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,090
I touched every corner of the body

453
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,440
But not His Majesty.

454
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,850
Every... Every corner

455
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,890
Omit further explanation

456
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,580
Oh my god

457
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,230
But if you live

458
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,440
Why don't you come back, my Lord?

459
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,780
Maybe he was injured or stuck somewhere.

460
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,870
Choi Sang-Gong

461
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:48,780
yes

462
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,920
The law that prevents a new lord from ascending the throne once the lord dies

463
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,110
Is there such a thing?

464
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,700
some

465
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,400
Called the upper position

466
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,020
You have to wait for the soul of the deceased prince for 5 days.

467
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,680
Only after that can the coronation ceremony be held

468
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
So including the day of the coronation ceremony, it's 6 days in total

469
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,060
In order to prevent the master from returning within these 6 days

470
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,380
Will do whatever it takes

471
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,870
How many maids are there in the palace?

472
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,170
Maids

473
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,310
Just a waitress

474
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,280
About 230 people

475
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,180
Plus other words

476
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,520
There are more than 600 people in total

477
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,870
600 Human CCTV

478
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,850
As long as one person hears

479
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,220
There are already 600 sentences.

480
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,360
Let's use the palace maids' internet

481
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,120
What what

482
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,510
You have to disrupt the coronation ceremony.

483
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,450
Are we on the same side?

484
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,840
come on

485
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,910
oily

486
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,140
Oil

487
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,020
Oil

488
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,260
Is His Highness still alive?

489
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,330
The fate of the country has many difficulties

490
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,850
Therefore, the throne cannot be postponed

491
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,850
To protect the kingdom, a new lord was chosen.

492
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,030
Nominate Lee Kyung-won, the 12th-generation descendant of Min-yeong Daewongun

493
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
And because of the rebellion of the traitors

494
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,190
The King is Dead

495
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,490
To those who have taken away the life of their Lord

496
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,450
The evil bandits have no mercy

497
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,030
I hereby declare that all the Eastern bandits will be killed without a single one left alive

498
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,830
It seems that the Eastern bandits finally got into trouble.

499
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,010
These bastards

500
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,850
Pooh

501
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,470
Big Brother

502
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,470
What is the reason for imprisoning Yongpyeong-gun and Hongbyeol?

503
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,780
The direction of power changes according to the master of the throne.

504
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,420
It's not just a matter of one or two days.

505
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,300
No matter what

506
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
How can you let an innocent person go to jail after your highness dies?

507
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,420
Not guilty

508
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,600
It is also a sin to stand on the side of the weak

509
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,430
Big Brother

510
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,290
Where are you planning to go?

511
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,010
I want to be a stronger person

512
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,610
For the things I cherish

513
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,480
More power is needed

514
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,820
Now make your lips look a little whiter.

515
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,010
Now it looks like the walking dead.

516
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,350
Then paint it white.

517
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,040
Looks like a dead zombie

518
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,340
Is it necessary to do this?

519
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,320
Now I am the only one on the same side with the Lord

520
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,330
No matter what

521
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,420
Pregnant women suffering from pregnancy depression

522
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,900
He probably won't be put in jail.

523
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,940
How do I look?

524
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
Like a dead zombie

525
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,350
Yeah

526
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,710
The Queen Mother has arrived

527
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,380
oops

528
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,870
The two really showed their acting skills.

529
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,260
But tonight's acting award is mine

530
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,050
Your Highness

531
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,110
Left me behind

532
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,590
What should we, the prince, do?

533
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,380
temple...

534
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,570
Your Highness

535
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,350
MILF

536
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,270
MILF

537
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,880
Your Highness

538
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,800
Call the imperial physician immediately.

539
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,640
Niangniang

540
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,760
Niangniang

541
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,030
Your Highness

542
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,540
I feel like I'll be scolded if I stay here for another second.

543
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,600
Mobile Mobile

544
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,790
Your Highness

545
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,240
Niangniang

546
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,710
Your Highness

547
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,410
oops

548
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,860
oops

549
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:14,080
Oops Oops Oops

550
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,030
Did you find me?

551
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,630
I know you were surprised to hear the news.

552
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,050
What happened to His Highness these days?

553
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,790
How did it suddenly become like this?

554
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,030
Lord

555
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,040
Still alive

556
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,660
I called you here to tell you this news.

557
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,930
Thanks

558
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,060
Thank you so much

559
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,520
so

560
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,640
Now is the beginning

561
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,670
After three days

562
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,110
The country can be stable now.

563
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,240
Thanks to the Lord

564
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,700
The Eastern bandits were executed

565
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,580
The remaining untouchables

566
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,370
I will also be timid.

567
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,700
To this extent

568
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,990
Isn't it a sacrifice of life?

569
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,230
Did you save the country?

570
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,850
But before that

571
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,370
I have a little worry

572
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,790
Then he asked the ministers for an audience

573
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,770
Ansong Kinmen and Pungyang Zhao family have a long-standing feud

574
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,940
To fight against our common enemy, the Lord.

575
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,120
Just a temporary alliance

576
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,150
Now it's missing

577
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,530
Afraid of biting and competing with each other

578
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,580
So before moving forward with new things

579
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,140
In order to consolidate the alliance between the two families

580
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,870
I prepared some things

581
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,600
The court is in chaos

582
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,040
The story of Iho

583
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,130
(The matter of abolishing the throne or electing a new king)
The story of Iho

584
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,390
(The matter of abolishing the throne or electing a new king)

585
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,570
That means treason.

586
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,520
It is the voice of everyone present here

587
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,030
The master is dead anyway.

588
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,700
Why do we keep this thing?

589
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,010
For joint liability

590
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,540
In order to prevent the other party from having other ideas in the future

591
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,080
You need proof of having taken a boat.

592
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,420
As long as you agree

593
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,140
Can guarantee

594
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,370
Balanced symbiosis between the two families

595
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,540
Held by the Military Minister

596
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,220
The lifeline of all of us?

597
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,540
We cannot agree

598
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,440
What is this doing now?

599
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,190
He actually called in the soldiers

600
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,440
Only consent can lead you out of this door

601
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,990
Niangniang

602
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,010
Come in, come in.

603
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,440
Niangniang

604
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,630
Did you find out anything?

605
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,950
It is true as the queen said, not only the palace gate

606
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,560
The people of Hanyang City are forbidden to enter or leave.

607
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,400
really

608
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,620
What are the soldiers' movements?

609
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,620
There is a place where soldiers are stationed and searched repeatedly

610
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,100
It is near a cliff

611
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,250
I found Cheoljong. I'm here.

612
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,120
You two can go down too if you are tired.

613
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,120
Very sleepy

614
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,520
Very sleepy

615
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,830
May you have a nice night, my lady.

616
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,950
Have a sweet dream, lady

617
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,640
Good night to you two too.

618
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,570
yes

619
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,790
Be healthy

620
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,440
What

621
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,600
Health is something you can never relax for a moment

622
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,530
It's the queen, it's the queen

623
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,260
Where is the nave?

624
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,670
Although I fainted, I recovered quickly.

625
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,830
syncope

626
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,390
Where are you going?

627
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,000
It's not what I thought.

628
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,680
Is this the final step?

629
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,400
Don't bother me

630
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,250
Can't

631
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,290
It would be dangerous for the empress to leave the palace

632
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,880
Do you think I don't know?

633
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,430
I know all

634
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,860
You used me as bait to put the master to death

635
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,000
You personally wield the sword against the Lord

636
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,490
I know all

637
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,840
As long as the central hall is safe

638
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,870
It doesn't matter if I'm hated

639
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,920
So feel free to resent and give up.

640
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,440
The master is dead anyway.

641
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,000
No, not dead

642
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,640
Don't you know that too?

643
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,440
The Lord will not die so easily

644
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,000
That's why the palace gates were sealed

645
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,320
Are you in a hurry to hold the coronation ceremony?

646
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,370
Madam, please

647
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,580
Only by giving up the master can you live

648
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,660
You ask me why I am the Lord, right?

649
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,650
I will answer you now

650
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,260
If someone must be king

651
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,470
I think the Lord is the most suitable

652
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,570
The most king-like person I have ever seen

653
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,560
So don't block it.

654
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,850
I'm going to cast my precious vote for the Lord

655
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,050
If you continue to block

656
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,180
I can't help it

657
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,980
Zhao Rong, how can you point an arrow at me?

658
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,740
Knowing my heart

659
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,960
If you really like it

660
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,920
At least you should know

661
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,680
Kim So-yong's Changes

662
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,490
Look at me

663
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,800
Is this the woman you've been thinking about?

664
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,060
A completely different person inside.

665
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,250
You can't see

666
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,020
You just like the shell.

667
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,000
Zhao Rong

668
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,300
The real Kim So-yong you loved is no longer here

669
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,560
What are you talking about?

670
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,270
The real Kim So Rong will not shoot arrows at you

671
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,140
At least I really like you as my brother.

672
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,570
But I'm different

673
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,140
I can shoot you

674
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,170
Didn't I warn you?

675
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,570
I don't know if I can really shoot you

676
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,100
Damn

677
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,310
What are you two?

678
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,260
It's so obvious I thought I would go another way

679
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,620
I came here to save my own life.

680
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,550
I feel so uneasy when I can't see my mother

681
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,620
Okay, let's go back.

682
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,950
No, my lady.

683
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,540
If you have to go alone

684
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,620
Then step on me.

685
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,650
Four days left

686
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,900
There are only four days left until the coronation ceremony.

687
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,230
Such a big mountain, you have to find it yourself

688
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,070
Can you find His Highness?

689
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,590
Really

690
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,310
Are you laughing at me now?

691
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
It's the queen

692
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,250
There are many wild animals in the mountains

693
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,810
You can't beat even one of them.

694
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,040
Become the jackal's lunch or

695
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,940
Frozen to death and found by soldiers

696
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,730
So scared, shaking

697
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,500
There's no point in saying it.

698
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,330
Go back

699
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,740
The queen doesn't want us to follow her.

700
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,910
For not stopping the nave from leaving

701
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,090
Drink a bowl of death medicine happily

702
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,390
Falling into endless sleep

703
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,650
Now that we know, let's go together.

704
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,610
It's not a good place to go.

705
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,680
What to do next?

706
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,400
But how do we get through Hanyangdoseong?

707
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,040
I originally wanted to use my outstanding strength to climb over the wall

708
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,530
But you two followed.

709
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,920
Hanyang City Wall is so high, what's the point of climbing over the wall?

710
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,970
Why do you always laugh at me?

711
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,530
We are all ready

712
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,740
Don't worry, ma'am.

713
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,020
Empress of the Middle Temple

714
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,940
I thought it was a toast.

715
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,560
But look at your expression

716
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,760
Looks like a loser's drink.

717
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,670
Can you heal the wound?

718
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,870
Where was the injury?

719
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,370
Take my wine glass again

720
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:59,390
I will break your wrists.

721
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,310
If you like her that much

722
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,770
You should at least see it.

723
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,570
Changes in Kim So-yong

724
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,500
Last night

725
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,380
I want to be exactly the same as my cousin.

726
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,770
What

727
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,450
Rebellion?

728
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,890
What nonsense are you talking about?

729
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,620
There was a real crisis.

730
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,200
What are you talking about treason or not?

731
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,160
You came back quite late.

732
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,430
Go back to your room and rest.

733
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,030
The fire keeps burning

734
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,450
So the room should be warm.

735
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,050
Why don't you ask anything?

736
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,850
That's what a father is.

737
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,020
What was produced

738
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,960
Created a document to plot a rebellion

739
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,430
Didn't tell me a word

740
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,270
They actually created something so dangerous.

741
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,400
If the document reaches us

742
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,230
It will become a weapon

743
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,470
So don't worry

744
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,650
I'll bring it to you.

745
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,390
The Lord is not here

746
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,740
My brother who was involved in the rebellion, if you come back

747
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,740
The picture is weird.

748
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,800
I don't need a job

749
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,400
I just want to be quiet in the back

750
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,630
It is enough to assist the Queen Mother.

751
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,720
Compared to this

752
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,590
I heard that the Queen Mother was out of the palace all night.

753
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,760
The mother of a country actually escaped in the middle of the night

754
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,950
Behind her back, people say she is a disgrace to the family.

755
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,840
I told you so quickly.

756
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,240
Just look at the behavior of the middle temple at ordinary times

757
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,050
This is not a simple escape

758
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,210
What is that?

759
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,530
I want to bring His Highness back.

760
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,710
Put everything back in place

761
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,040
The Highness is sure that His Highness is still alive.

762
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,150
Is there anything you can be sure of?

763
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,270
She took off her clothes and left the palace.

764
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,330
Now the Queen is just one of the ordinary women

765
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,580
I know it's a lie

766
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,060
I think Bingren is really working too hard.

767
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,430
I'm thinking of accepting it.

768
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,300
The nave and the lord who love each other so much

769
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,900
To bury them nameless in the grass

770
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,700
Brother, are you going to do it?

771
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,700
grown ups

772
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,050
I'm here to help the Queen Mother

773
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,360
So I got reinstated.

774
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,670
Is it them?

775
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,520
The one who took the life of King Daxing

776
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:05,700
Yes

777
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,050
We are just herb pickers.

778
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,880
I have never seen the face of His Majesty the Lord.

779
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,700
Then it's not as good as the bug guys

780
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,540
Without knowing it

781
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,380
Caught the dragon in the sky

782
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,460
Look at the way you stood up.

783
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,880
It should be quite normal.

784
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,840
I thought it was going to be a funeral.

785
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,240
Who are you

786
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,210
Who could it be?

787
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,830
He's a herb picker.

788
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,880
Otherwise, why would I be in this deep mountain?

789
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,210
Did you save me?

790
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,060
Rather than saving

791
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,920
I should say I picked it up.

792
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,310
You are dressed elegantly.

793
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:04,400
Feeling of saving you

794
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,070
What will you give me in return?

795
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,750
Nothing in this world is free

796
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,650
You don't have anything valuable.

797
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,110
Looks like expensive clothes.

798
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,110
But I can't sell them even if they are all torn apart

799
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,720
So they were all burned

800
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,810
Is it burned?

801
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,660
Recently, some soldiers have been searching in the mountains.

802
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,440
Did I pick up something that would cause a headache?

803
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,510
Is anyone there?

804
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,430
If you run away without paying the medical fee

805
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,180
I will use this guillotine to cut off your wrist

806
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:40,860
Got it?

807
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,520
The ones installed are all rough

808
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,230
Then what

809
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,490
And then what? And then what?

810
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,720
Then what about you, my lady?

811
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,290
Then they hurriedly held a funeral with a fake corpse.

812
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:17,100
If you can hold on for six days

813
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,900
A new king will be enthroned

814
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,520
Finish

815
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,340
But how did you know?

816
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,670
It's obvious what the bad guys do.

817
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,230
God damn the bad guys

818
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,810
This is the confession of the Eastern Bandit.

819
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,700
The criminal has been found.

820
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,100
After the coronation ceremony

821
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,230
Find a suitable time to make it public.

822
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,230
Father

823
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,860
Can you temporarily

824
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,160
I'll leave the palace guarding to you.

825
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,050
Why?

826
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,650
I want to personally

827
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,340
I'm here to see you with the head of the Lord and the Middle Temple

828
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:18,660
(3 days before the enthronement ceremony)

829
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,180
Big Brother

830
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,200
You're going to look for the Queen Mother, right?

831
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,430
Why did the lady run away from home?

832
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,020
You should know it.

833
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,580
After all, you have a very close relationship.

834
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,840
Zhongdian is no longer the sister I knew before

835
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,030
We should bring His Highness here quickly.

836
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,150
Such a simple lock

837
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,590
Can be opened with bare hands

838
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,760
What's going on?

839
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,580
It must be locked very securely.

840
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,790
How did you...

841
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,200
Hongbiejian

842
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,290
Yongping, are you okay?

843
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,310
How did you get here?

844
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,840
Everyone in the palace is my friend.

845
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,420
Because you are His Highness's closest relatives.

846
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,390
The reason with my elder brother was the reason for the conviction.

847
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,160
Don't worry about anything

848
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,890
I will do life-saving exercises

849
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,280
I'll definitely rescue you.

850
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,780
Jin Huan, you are really

851
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,090
This is how things have become.

852
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,150
Why haven't you changed at all?

853
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:45,770
Of course

854
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,440
Just like you're not because

855
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,370
I am the Ansong Jin family who approached me like that

856
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,790
I'm not approaching you.

857
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,380
Because you are His Highness's closest relative.

858
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,810
But now the palace is in chaos.

859
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,850
He said he wanted to destroy all the Eastern bandits who harmed His Highness.

860
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,160
I wonder if innocent people will be hurt.

861
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,500
and

862
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,640
The Queen Mother disappeared at night.

863
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,630
What does that mean?

864
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,200
Did the Queen Mother disappear?

865
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,810
With her clothes, her palace maids

866
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,550
Avoid other people's eyes and disappear

867
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,800
Just now, Brother Bingren left the palace to look for the Queen.

868
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,410
But the atmosphere was extraordinary

869
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,460
What's wrong with the atmosphere?

870
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,720
I should have thought too much.

871
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,760
It's like he's going to kill the Queen.

872
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,200
What happened? What happened?

873
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,610
alright

874
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,910
Let's go

875
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,030
What? Choi Sang-Gong?

876
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,860
It gave me a fright.

877
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,120
Be careful every moment

878
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,230
That's right.

879
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,520
Anyway, our Choi Sang-Gong is extremely cautious.

880
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,020
It's okay, go ahead.

881
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,820
Come over here

882
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,910
Be careful

883
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,480
Why did you pack these things?

884
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:28,900
What's this

885
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,320
Platycodon candied fruit

886
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:32,550
Platycodon candied fruit

887
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,440
It was given by a very precious person.

888
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,190
So save food

889
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,220
My lady, please eat.

890
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,100
Then I tried one.

891
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,040
Really delicious

892
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,320
You should try one too.

893
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,630
Even Hong Yan?

894
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:47,720
good

895
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,240
Choi Sang-Gong should eat one too.

896
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,510
It's really delicious

897
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,480
Choi Sang-Gong

898
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,430
I'm fine

899
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,050
I'm fine

900
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,770
I have no problem, sis.

901
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,750
So strong

902
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,000
Where is His Highness?

903
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,990
The spoiled lady

904
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,160
How do you sleep in a place like this?

905
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,160
I've slept many times.

906
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,600
Madam, are you

907
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,920
I've never slept like this before.

908
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,080
This is just a small matter.

909
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,120
I also carry a 50 kg backpack

910
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,270
Have you ever marched a thousand miles?

911
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,000
Thousand miles?

912
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,650
Lying is a bit too much

913
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,890
It's said to be a thousand miles

914
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,550
Okay, Qianli is a liar.

915
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,780
500 miles is available

916
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:45,910
When training in extreme cold

917
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,470
Will melt the snow to replace water

918
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,610
Goodbye

919
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,130
It must have melted.

920
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,910
It's true

921
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,650
Got it, Madam.

922
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,690
You will catch a cold

923
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,230
I couldn't light a fire for fear of being discovered.

924
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,410
I'm really worried about how to spend this cold night.

925
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,040
I am terrified, madam.

926
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,510
What's so cold?

927
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,930
This level is compared with the cold training

928
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:13,960
It's a piece of cake

929
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,210
Niangniang

930
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:46,910
Please turn off the air conditioner.

931
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,910
If this continues, I'll catch a cold.

932
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,400
(Code word)

933
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,960
Not found yet

934
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,940
Separate them and search carefully.

935
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,940
Yes Yes

936
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,580
Wow

937
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,450
I feel like today's feeling is good.

938
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,830
It feels like the weather is good enough to see His Majesty.

939
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,550
Not this time

940
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,910
Go quickly, yes

941
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,240
Going to leave soon

942
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,500
I feel like it's almost here, sis.

943
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,360
All arrived

944
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,050
Go up a little further and you will reach the cliff.

945
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,110
It turns out that people in their teens are really different.

946
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,800
Endurance is too strong

947
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,140
Let's take a break.

948
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,830
Good lady

949
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:09,940
but

950
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,040
Outside the palace

951
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,640
Everything feels better, ma'am.

952
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:20,640
I hate people coming outside the palace.

953
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,210
Hong Yan, how about you?

954
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,260
Do you prefer inside or outside the palace?

955
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,160
I like wherever the queen is.

956
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,560
Hey, what are you doing?

957
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:38,330
The lady is that group of people

958
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,590
There

959
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,160
Catch them

960
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,060
Hurry up and escape!

961
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,910
Niangniang

962
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,120
Hurry up and take the queen away quickly

963
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,620
What are you doing Choi Sang-Gong?

964
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,550
Choi Sang-Gong

965
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,600
No, these guys.

966
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,720
Can't

967
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,330
Madam, please leave quickly.

968
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,530
Choi Sang-Gong

969
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,860
No, no, no

970
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:59,810
Let me go

971
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,540
Niangniang

972
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,630
Can't

973
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,390
Back off

974
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,130
Choi Sang-Gong

975
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,090
Madam, you can't

976
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,660
Go fast

977
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:28,790
Fast Chase

978
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,920
Please stop.

979
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:31,750
Damn

980
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,960
No, don't go.

981
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,110
Choi Sang-Gong

982
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:36,870
Niangniang

983
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:38,670
Please

984
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:39,890
Choi Sang-Gong

985
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,020
Can't

986
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:42,600
Can't

987
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,880
Madam, please go quickly.

988
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,900
Let me go quickly. What are you doing holding me?

989
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,990
Choi Sang-Gong

990
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,570
Niangniang

991
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:57,730
Run away quickly, my lady.

992
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,020
Madam, you have to find His Highness.

993
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,240
Hong Yan

994
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,250
Over there

995
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,650
Who are you

996
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,640
What on earth did you do to Zhao Rong?

997
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,370
(This drama is purely fictional and the characters, groups, events, etc. are not related to history)

998
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,740
(Preview of the next episode)

999
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,440
You said you knew everything about me and Zhao Rong

1000
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,120
Suddenly I knew everything.

1001
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,710
The memory of this woman

1002
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,740
If you still have memories

1003
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,530
It means that there is still Zhao Rong in your body

1004
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,080
Hold my hand before you escape to safety

1005
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,250
It is true.

1006
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,990
All pretentious until the end

1007
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,430
Go catch

1008
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,190
Go after the middle temple
