1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:08,870

2
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,990
   

3
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,960
   

4
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,160
  It was you. You're that bastard. 

5
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,320
I won't forgive you.

6
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,290
I will end your life.

7
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,060
   

8
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,340
   

9
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,480
Do you know now? Who the owner of this palace is.

10
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,030
I mistook you for an animal, I could've accidentally shot you.

11
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,300
Not that you missed the target regretfully?

12
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,210
It's a misunderstanding.

13
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,340
Remember your place.

14
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,670
I have to change.

15
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

16
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,190
There is some work that the Royal Investigation Bureau should do.

17
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,190
Did you really have to do such a thing to Oh Wol?

18
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,180
What did I do?

19
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,590
Did you have to kill her like that?

20
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,660
Did you have to kill her and brutally throw her into the well,

21
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,530
just to threaten me?

22
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,450
Did you have to do that to a girl who was innocent?

23
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:20,180
I killed her? You've misunderstood. Unless it's for cooking, I don't harm any living thing.

24
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,080
The fact that the corpse was found in the well is either an ill-fated coincidence,

25
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,790
or the action of someone trying to drive a wedge between us.

26
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,870
Keep denying that you did it so I can feel more rage.

27
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,130
I'm going crazy! It really wasn't me!

28
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,600
Why do you keep seeing me as the villain?

29
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,300
Because you're that kind of person. The Kim So-yong I know has the potential to be like this.

30
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I don't even know myself, but you think you know me better?

31
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,100
The people that liars can lie to the most easily

32
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,790
are themselves.

33
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,420
Since they always fool themselves so much, they don't know who they themselves really are.

34
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,470
You and I have officially crossed a river that cannot be reversed.

35
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,190
I'm not going to concern myself anymore with what you misunderstand about me.

36
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,300
So do whatever you want.

37
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,630
   

38
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,790
Who caught it? We were having such a hard time catching it! Who dared to catch it?

39
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,590
I think the points are all done, why don't we slowly start heading back now?

40
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,490
Blood?

42
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,360
Are you crazy? That hurt so much!

43
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,990
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
My hand slipped.

45
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
What the...?

46
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,500
- Are you hurt, Your Majesty? 
 - Even though it's cotton, the impact must have been huge.

47
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,740
My Lady, what do you think you're doing—

48
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,130
I'm going to return what she did to me. She's so dead!

49
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,060
Huh?

50
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,640
Seeing your faces, I'm going to restrain myself for today!

51
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,530
Because I'm her superior.

52
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,450
Wait for me in Huijeongjeon. 
  (The king's bed-chamber and office) 

53
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,190
- But, I usually help you change— 
 - Since there is a force trying to ruin the banquet,

54
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,660
I will move by myself.

55
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,990
The many people present today will say that the king has a lot of power.

56
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,650
Whatever has been said about the king before, like Young Master of Ganghwa Island,

57
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,260
will be regarded as lies.

58
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,890
The king kept insisting on a banquet,

59
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,990
but it was for him to reveal his new image.

60
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,500
He has been getting things ready,

61
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,640
but what were you doing in that time?

62
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:15,430
I'm sorry. However, I also prepared something for the king beforehand.

63
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,790
Please wait and watch, Your Royal Highness.

64
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,080
You better have prepared it well.

65
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,920
Her Ladyship Suk-ui Hong,

66
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,560
one point.

67
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,050
Her Ladyship Eui Bin, two points.

68
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,210
Her Ladyship Suk-ui Min,

69
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,500
four points!

70
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,530
Her Ladyship Suk-ui Yoon, four points as well!

71
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,790
Her Majesty the Queen... ten points!

72
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,670
Due to this, the winner is

73
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,200
Her Majesty the Queen.

74
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager will reward the winner.

75
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,770
You said you just enjoyed the process, but did you secretly practice?

76
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,490
I am fit for the stage

77
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,770
and do better in real situations.

78
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,810
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

79
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,380
- Congratulations, Your Majesty. 
  - Congratulations, Your Majesty. 

80
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,990
What a cunning thing.

81
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,240
We must move to Daejeon for the banquet. 
  (The Great Hall) 

82
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,440
There's still time until the banquet,

83
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,360
so you should all get some rest since hunting must have been tiring.

84
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,390
- Yes, Your Royal Highness. 
  - Yes, Your Royal Highness. 

85
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,070
- Did it hurt a lot? 
 - Oh, this?

86
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,070
I now know why Eunuch Kim was so afraid.

87
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,910
Your Majesty, you should change into some new robes.

88
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,870
I should also get some rest as well.

89
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,000
The back of my head still feels numb.

90
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,110
Hurry up! There isn't much time left until the banquet.

91
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,650
Why did Eui Bin do that?

92
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,030
There's definitely someone trying to drive us apart.

93
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,910
Who?

94
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,460
  Someone that knows of the incident in the well. 

95
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,070
Inside the palace, there are three connections that continue to get entangled throughout history.

96
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,880
Fighting between women, the struggle for power,

97
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,560
and poisonings.

98
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,600
Is that why you keep talking about poison?

99
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,020
Living in the palace for years,

100
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,580
I have seen many people lose their lives by various poisons.

101
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,590
Deadly poisons that can kill you with even one sip

102
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,400
or hidden poisons that slowly poison a person to death so that the cause of death can be disguised as an illness.

103
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,760
It hasn't been fully revealed

104
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,840
but there have been many suspicious deaths that were seemingly connected to poison.

105
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,410
You're right. The palace is known to be a dangerous place.

106
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,700
Now that I think about it, that guy earlier who looked like Director Han...

107
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,210
Yes, him!

108
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,630
 ....when I took a look, it was a woman.  I was afraid she might have seen what I did, but she didn't. 

109
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,440
 So I ran away immediately. 

110
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,900
 - You're certain? 
 - Yes. 

111
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,800
Got you.

112
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,060
Court Lady Choi, find out who that man is.

113
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,940
I bet that man's last name is Han.  I'd even bet both of my dragon balls, which are now gone.

114
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,590
The banquet will resume in a little bit.

115
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,920
It can't. Not with that guy running around.

116
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,110
I'm sorry?

117
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,450
Then the Head Chef of Royal Kitchen... That little—

118
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,500
Why is everything that's going on similar to what happened to me?

119
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,110
And Cheoljong has no idea what's going on.

120
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,670
As expected, people need to live like they look to not have any regrets. I'm just going to ignore this like I usually do.

121
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,250
But that guy definitely put something in the water earlier.

122
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,460
Was it poison?

123
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,950
Nah, no way.

124
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,510
Even though the palace is dangerous, who would poison a group of people, just to ruin a banquet?

125
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,220
I told you, fear and anxiety can be transferred!

126
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,800
Where are you going?

127
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,410
I'm going to the crime scene to secure the evidence.

128
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,900
This is the way to the queen's residence.

129
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,660
My mind is all over the place that I'm getting things confused.

130
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,550
Wait for me, Your Majesty!

131
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,580
It kind of smells like grass. What on earth did he put in here?

132
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,490
No, Your Majesty!

133
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,910
Right?

134
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,340
This isn't good. Your Majesty!

135
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,670
I did as much as I could. The banquet is going to start soon but the ingredients haven't arrived.

136
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,960
Even if it's late, the ingredients will certainly arrive.

137
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,510
Trust me and don't give up.

138
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,700
I will also look for other ways.

139
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,740
Just give up.

140
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,780
- It's easier to give up, you fool. 
 - My Queen.

141
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,340
You already know that it's bound to be ruined.

142
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:56,010
The more you resist, the people around you, as well as you yourself, will be in pain.

143
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,290
Then, should I just take it all in like I'm a corpse?

144
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,450
I can't do that.

145
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,390
I will do my best to do everything I can.

146
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,240
So if my efforts like this are bothering you,

147
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,660
please ignore me.

148
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh right!  We're doing "no touch," aren't we?  Okay, got it.

149
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,820
Your Majesty, why did you say something you don't mean?

150
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,420
What do you mean? I'm someone who sincerely means everything I say, even if it's nonsense.

151
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,680
I've never said something I didn't mean.

152
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,800
It's because you're worried that His Majesty the King will be hurt as much as the efforts he's put into it.

153
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,430
Why would I?

154
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,640
The most useless things to worry about in this world are worrying about celebrities and kings.

155
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,160
Looking at you these days, you always seem to say weird things when you want to hide your sincerity.

156
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,180
As expected, someone put poison in the water.

157
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,020
Hey! Where's the Head Chef?

158
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,620
He was just here. I can't...

159
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,220
He ran off? He pretended to care so much about his job but left to save himself.

160
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,760
Then, what about the banquet? His Majesty has put in so much effort.

161
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,540
There are no ingredients and the cook ran off. It's over.

162
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,760
 Then, should I just take it all in like I'm a corpse? 

163
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,640
 I can't do that. 

164
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,160
 I will do my best to do everything I can. 

165
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,700
Gosh, seriously.

166
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,110
Hong Yeon, you're going to have to help me out.

167
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,410
Good work.

168
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,040
   

169
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,110
Good work.

170
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,870
What was the name of the person who just left?

171
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,700
Why are you asking that?

172
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm asking because it's worth asking.

173
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,040
I can't tell you.

174
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,500
Leaving the trouble-maker queen to go to the banquet by herself,

175
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,270
who knows what will happen?

176
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,190
It's been a long time. I caught a cold.

177
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,590
I'll borrow this for just a moment. Thank you.

178
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,680
Rice. It's rice!

179
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:48,060


180
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,130
It's one of my regular customers!

181
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,920
I have a lot of new products for you to look at.

182
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,730
This isn't the time for this. You got the wrong person.

183
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,670
Wh-What? No, I'm sure I'm right.

184
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,430
Why are there so many temptations today?

185
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,310
However, I, Court Lady Choi, can't be shaken.

186
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,300
Do you want something from me, Court Lady?

187
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,200
   
  (The Great Throne Hall: For Court sessions and various state functions) 

188
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,510
Hiding those skills and just sitting still,

189
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,690
how did you restrain yourself all this time?

190
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,850
It's become a habit so my body is used to it.

191
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,830
I see.

192
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,050
Here. Is this enough?

193
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,280
Is it true that the man in this magic glass

194
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,140
is not yourself?

195
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,430
It's not me.

196
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,090
Honestly, when I glanced at it,

197
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,730
the sharp physical traits are similar to mine.

198
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,720
But unfortunately, it's not me.

199
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,670
You're so similar to him, so it's an honor to get your name engraved on it.

200
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,170
Well, it's nothing. By the way...

201
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,560
These days, among the court ladies,

202
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,430
this man is that popular?

203
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,120
Rather than popularity, it's a sort of

204
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,290
fever?

205
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,360
I didn't know I would be this popular.

206
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,170
Well, ahem...

207
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,910
Such a great man like yourself has the name of...

208
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,800
Surname Han, given name is Sim-ong.

209
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,660
Therefore, Han Sim-ong.

210
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,880
   

211
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,910
Don't forget.

212
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,500
When the banquet reaches its peak

213
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,060
and the king is standing tall the most,

214
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,900
that is the time to take out the ledger.

215
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,990
   

216
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,030
    
 (Queen's Residence)

217
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,310
You there.

218
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,550
I have a request for you.

219
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,080
Can you deliver this to that person over there?

220
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,390
Which one?

221
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,710
That one.

222
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,260
Ah... yes.

223
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:41,660
Sir, that Young Master over there asked me to deliver this to you.

224
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,240
  Placing my lineage on the line, there is something I must tell you. 

225
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,670
 I will wait for you at the pavilion. 

226
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,910
Has he become aware of what's happened?

227
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,000
You came.

228
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,050
I asked you here since I had something to tell you.

229
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,930
To me, my lineage is as important as my life.

230
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,370
However,

231
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,440
after having thought about this for endless nights, I have decided.

232
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,080
I have chosen something that is more important than my lineage.

233
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,210
If my lineage does not allow for it,

234
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,160
I will abandon my lineage.

235
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,220
I want to be your personal flower boy.

236
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,330
Are you joking with a busy person?

237
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,540
Darn it!

238
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,700
Such an accident in delivery.

239
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,450
What did I do again?

240
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,280
- It hurts. 
 - Oh my tummy, it's killing me.

241
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,370
Stick out your tongue.

242
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,880
Stick it out more.

243
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,240
You ate medicinal herbs laced with a toxin.

244
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,310
 Ah, my tummy...  

245
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,640
I think perhaps,

246
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,400
raw knotweed was grated into it.

247
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,680
All you fellows!

248
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,720
Huh? Why...

249
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,560
You came yourself?

250
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,470
The queen sent me over here.

251
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,230
The queen told me to inspect the drinking water

252
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,900
and I found someone has put a toxic herb in it.

253
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,250
The drinking water was the problem.

254
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,340
How are you fine?

255
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,570
I am as sensitive as I look, so I can't even drink water when I'm nervous.

256
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,090
You look as if you'd sleep well even in the middle of a battlefield with cannonballs flying about.

257
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,710
For a doctor, you don't seem to know how to look at people very well.

258
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm a doctor, not a face reader.

259
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,460
But even though I am a good doctor,

260
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,020
it will be hard for any of these people to make a full recovery today.

261
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,890
Even if the ingredients come, the cooks are in this state.

262
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,450
Who could've done this?

263
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,880
I've never seen that guy before.

264
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,340
Was it you who laced it with poison?

265
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,120
- Huh? 
 - Oh, dear...

266
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm the guest chef whom the king specially sent for the banquet.

267
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,700
My name is Lee Saeng-mang.

268
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,540
I'm here to save this hell-like kitchen.

269
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,980
Here.

270
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,660
Anyone can see it is Your Majesty.

271
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,070
Isn't that right?

272
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,350
How is he, Her Majesty the Queen? It's a man.

273
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,050
Your ability to see people is not very good.

274
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,990
Why are you looking for the queen who should be at the banquet watching the dancing?

275
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,580
Officially, it's right for the queen to be at the banquet.

276
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,150
- Right? 
 - Ah, I see.

277
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,730
Tomato?

278
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,250
What nonsense are you saying?

279
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,560
It's a ilnyeon-gam, boy.  Ilnyeon-gam since it only lives one year. 
  (T/N: 'ilnyeon' - 1 year, 'gam' - persimmon) 

280
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,010
Are you a country boy? You call yourself a chef, yet don't even know its name.

281
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,510
How dare you call me, boy?

282
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,920
We're the same, chefs, and I can't even call you boy?

283
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,750
- Aren't I right? 
 - That's right. Boy!

284
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,750
Hey, that's too much.

285
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,840
Coming from a man who ran away from his kitchen.

286
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,110
What are you talking about? I went to Nae Nong Po

287
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,250
- in order to find something to stop the stomachaches. 
 - Nae Nong Po?

288
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,680
Nae Nong Po, the king's garden! You really know nothing.

289
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,610
Let's see what we have here.

290
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,360
 The first step to cooking starts with getting good ingredients. 

291
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,640
Along with the king's garden, does the king have a chicken coop?

292
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,960
It would be better if we had some eggs.

293
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,760
Seeing as your stomach is already growling,

294
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,010
it seems you starved yourself since yesterday to eat banquet food.

295
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,140
Since you know that my stomach has been starved,

296
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,120
that means you also did the same.

297
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,250
In a bit, the banquet that you strongly wished for will start.

298
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,950
I have high expectations.

299
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,250
 The banquets at the Blue House always had a theme. 

300
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,050
Because it's not a simple setting only for eating, it also has a political agenda.

301
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,830
What would be good?

302
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,690
What's the point of this banquet?

303
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,040
What is this?

304
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,950
The bal-gi  (food list)  of dishes that the King personally made and a list of all the people attending the banquet.

305
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,660
This is that famous bal-gi of dishes?

306
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,130
I'm going to make a new food list matching the ingredients we have.

307
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,220
How is it going?

308
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm ashamed.

309
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,560
We met bandits on our way to the palace, but it seems that the ingredients weren't their target.

310
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,700
Finally, it has started.

311
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,570
You said it was a feast.

312
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,850
But there's only one dish served?

313
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,170
Is this the Chanan-sang? 
   (The feast table served to the king at state banquets)  

314
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,010
Is this all?

315
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,210
There must be other dishes coming.

316
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,690
Your Majesty, what happened?

317
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,520
Citizens starve every year due to an impoverished period in spring

318
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,780
and many of them die of that starvation.

319
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,630
For us to not forget those difficulties,

320
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,320
I have prepared a simple meal for the people today.

321
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,950
The meaning behind this is great,

322
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,810
but this is even below simple.

323
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,650
Even though it may be correct to teach us,

324
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:28,030
this is an inappropriate table to serve the lords of the three families, who traveled so far to be here today.

325
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,720
Inviting them as your guests and serving a small table like this, is a punishment.

327
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,350
The food may be lacking, but the meaning behind it is overwhelming,

328
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,110
so please understand.

329
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
   

330
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,430
 Skewer it like this. 

331
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,370
 What kind of doodle is this? 

332
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,560
 Give me a potato. I'll make a sample. 

333
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,700
 Your big needle has finally found its place. 

334
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,320
 Huh? 

335
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,770
 Now, put an oil pot on the fire. 

336
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,220
 Oil? 

337
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,690
 How dare you kill my precious needle? 

338
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,150
 I'll clean it well and give it back to you. 

339
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,780
 Do you know how precious it is? 

340
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,000
 I got it from my teacher, that is a fifty-year-old needle! 

341
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,050
 Forget it! Forget it! 

342
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,080
 Fifty years? Then you've used it enough. 

343
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,570
 No, I'm going to use it more! 

344
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,250
 I'm going to give it to my disciple, too! 

345
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,720
 No, don't put it in there! 

346
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,510
 Here! 

347
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,370
 Piercing it through the middle gives it a good shape. 

348
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,780
 And the center of the potato is fully cooked in a short period of time. 

349
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,410
 How did you come up with such an innovative idea? 

350
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,810
 Street food is a fight with time. 

351
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,770
 It's perfect for such an urgent situation like today. 

352
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,170
 Stree... 

353
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,240
 There is something like that. It's like a battleground for taste. 

354
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,470
 This has survived in such fierce battles. 

355
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,460
♫  Bong-hwan!   ♫

356
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,500
♫  Bong-hwan!   ♫

357
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,410
 Here. Peel the potatoes. 

358
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,230
 Me? 

359
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,510
 Then, who? 

360
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,840
 You said you needed taffies? 

361
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,490
 I've been asked to see how the preparations are going— 

362
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,580
 Your Maj— 

363
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,830
♫  What on earth should I do now?   ♫

364
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,920
♫  How complicated this is!   ♫

365
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,840
♫  Those days to live at my pleasure and in my style, 
 they are now over!  ♫

366
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,870
♫  How strange it is!  ♫

367
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,870
♫  I've stayed up one night and another, 
 but I'm still in this world!  ♫

368
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,250
 Make sure you only peel the skin. 

369
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,830
 Cut it as thin as possible. 

370
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,720
 Thinly. 

371
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,910
 Make the ends pointy. 

372
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,190
 It has to go through the potato well. 

373
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,940
 - The first fire is too strong. 
 - Ah, yes. 

374
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,720
 - The second fire is too weak. 
 - Yes. 

375
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,250
 All of you guys, keep in mind! 

376
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,090
 What we're making today is not just food, 

377
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,820
 it's the president's face. 

378
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,320
 Huh... 

379
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,850
 What I meant was it's the king's face. 

380
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,910
 Ah... 

381
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,820
 Is this enough, Your Majesty? 

382
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,820
 I mean, Cook? 

383
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,060
 Let me see. 

384
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,810
 You did well! 

385
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,320
 I hope Cheoljong understands my theme well. 

386
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,200
This is a simple meal of the people?

387
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,710
Was I the only one who didn't know what the people eat?

388
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,870
   

389
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,300
Even if my meaning was great,

390
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,260
I couldn't treat my precious guests as normal.

391
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:27,520
Instead, even though the ingredients are lacking, I've prepared something new.

392
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,580
The first food of the banquet is made out of potatoes.

393
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,990
This is a potato?

394
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,630
Not just a simple potato.

395
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,660
Its name is...

396
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,560
 Spring? 

397
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,450
 "Yong-su" potato! 

398
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,650
It looks like a dragon's beard

399
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,520
so it is "Yong-su" potato. 
  (T/N: yong - dragon, su - beard) 

400
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,470
A lucky food for such a lucky day.

401
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,170
Even so, it's still just a potato.

402
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,390
Dragon?  You're over-exaggerating its meaning.

403
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,190
If there were no potatoes, we would've lost even more lives every year.

404
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,510
Simple as it looks, a potato can grow easily in even barren soil and it's easy to store them, too.

405
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,720
It allows the people to overcome the impoverishment of spring and have food.

406
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,740
For such a divine crop that saves the lives of our people,

407
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,800
can you still say it is just a potato?

408
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,730
Try it.

409
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,420
Wow, even the flavor is good,

410
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,540
but the texture is something I've never experienced before!

411
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,430
You must've been really hungry.

412
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,350
Huh?

413
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,640
This is a potato?

414
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,940
Huh?

415
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,110
Of the three powders that come with it, the green powder

416
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,870
is pine salt made of sun-dried salt and Myeongsong pine needles,

417
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,890
which came from the Hwaseong Temporary Palace, the Namyang Hong Family's home town.

418
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,360
The light pink powder is wild grape sugar.

419
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,040
Sugar during the spring poverty?

420
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,240
With such an extravagant period of spring poverty,

421
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,900
I wouldn't be afraid of it every day of the year!

422
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,770
This sugar is made from the taffies that our people usually enjoy.

423
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,510
Mixing them with wild grapes from Mountain Gamak, where the Papyeong Yoon Family has roots,

424
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,640
the wonderful color and smell is the result.

425
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,530
The yellow preserve is made of peaches.

426
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,850
It's made from the best quality peaches from Yeoju, which is the Yeoheung Min Family's hometown.

427
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,750
The theme of this banquet today is harmony.

428
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,960
Politics can separate people,

429
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,340
but yummy food can bring people together.

430
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,310
The harmony from combining these three prestigious families, whom we honor at today's banquet,

431
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,070
I hope you enjoy the flavor and the outcome.

432
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,690
 Sweet potato, pumpkin, eggplant. Cut them into small pieces and fry them all, 

433
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,550
 then add the broth and egg to make whole tomato stew. 

434
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,130
 The fresh idea of eating the bowl, too, will make them go wild! 

435
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,830
Are you almost done?

436
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,340
Not yet. Barley and soybean powder.

437
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,190
You've made us knead all the powders that exist.

438
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,080
What you're making is the banquet's main event.

439
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,060
I understand.

440
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,220
What are you doing? Knead it harder like me.

441
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,630
This movement is bad for your shoulders and wrists.

442
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,260
Do it like this!

443
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,800
Like this with strength from your shoulders and wrist,

444
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,320
so that it all comes together!

445
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,300
It's ready.

446
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,340
Oh, really?

447
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,170
Okay!

448
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,960
 It would be disappointing if meat wasn't included in the banquet. 

449
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,650
 The main dish will be complete with vegan hamburger steaks. 

450
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,070
   

451
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,960
It's an edible lucky pouch.

452
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,970
Since it's red every day of the year, it's called ilnyeon-gam or the yearly persimmon. Its red color chases away any evil spirits.

453
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,720
How could something be this smooth?

454
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,550
Short rib rounds?

455
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,440
It can't be. You said to make sure the meat couldn't arrive—

456
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,550
I mean, there's no way there could be meat during the spring poverty.

457
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,990
In the proverb, the heavens have dragon meat while the ground has donkey meat.

458
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,370
Here in the spring poverty, there is soybean meat.

459
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,700
Barley is "Mac," soybean is "Du," gain weight is "Nal," and stomach is "Du."

460
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,000
Therefore, 'Mac-Du-Nal-Du'!  (McDonald's) 

461
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,880
♪ McDonald's... ♪

462
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,900
   

463
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,940
Just like meat, it tastes great and fills you up.

464
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,170
It makes sense!

465
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,000
How elegant.

466
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,180
 The pre-made colorful jellies are put on as decoration to make it eye-catching. 

467
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,170
 The point of dessert is not only to eat it with the mouth, but also with the eyes. 

468
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,840
Whoa!  Look at the colors.

469
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,800
  Now add a bit of drama to this and it's the perfect ending to a party! 

470
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,550
   

471
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,800
It looks pretty, but it's just plain old sweet red bean jelly.

472
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,470
It seems like the end of your fascinating talents.

473
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,560
The stick in this is not just for convenience but also has a fortune written on it.

474
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,700
Fortune...

475
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,200
With the meaning of embracing spring, Po-Chun (Fortune) Jelly. 
  (T/N: Po - embrace, Chun - Spring) 

476
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,940
As a wish from me for everyone to have spring-like days.

477
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,110
As we finish this banquet, also try to read your fortune for today.

478
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,120
What blasphemy!  Telling us to read our fortune in such a sacred place as the palace?

479
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,950
   

480
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,730
One more!

481
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,060
One more?

482
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,770
Try again next time.

483
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,300
   

484
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,590
I'm so tired.

485
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,530
Instead of ingredients, I put my soul into it.

486
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,590
I'm so tired I feel like dying.

487
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,150
We did it. We did it.

488
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,700
Do you know what I'm thinking about right now?

489
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,340
I know. I feel exactly as you do.

490
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,540
- Fishcake. 
 - What?

491
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,310
I'm thinking about fishcakes right now.

492
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,100
The cook who almost lost his life to Qin Shi Huang invented fishcakes the night before.

493
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,010
I just thought it was because he was just lucky.

494
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,380
But that wasn't the case.

495
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,650
It was definitely thought of at the last moments as he was fighting for his life.

496
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:03,910
Inspiration isn't so common as to even come to people who give up, you know?

497
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,160
 Your Majesty! 

498
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,250
 Your Majesty! 

499
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,070
You're going to lose your breath... Here have some water.

500
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,310
Drink up.

501
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,140
He's from the Han family line.

502
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,280
Right? He's a Han, isn't he!

503
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,020
Yes. His name is Sim-ong. Han Sim-ong.

504
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,770
Simon? Why is his name so foreign?

505
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,110
Oh, Han Sim-ong.

506
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,620
Yes.

507
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,340
But what is this?

508
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,180
Oh! It's nothing, Your Majesty!

509
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,580
While I was out of the palace, I went to Hanseongbu  (city hall) 

510
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,040
and looked carefully through the entire bloodline of his family.

511
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,400
It's certainly a fake genealogy he bought with money.

512
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,050
That is exactly something Director Han's ancestors would do.

513
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,450
Since he wasn't invited due to him being a fake nobleman, he was going to use such dirty tricks to be included?

514
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,970
Your Majesty, you shouldn't be here like this.

515
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,260
It's bad for you to be absent for too long.

516
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,450
Oh, right! Right!

517
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,210
Court Lady Choi, good work. Let's go, go!

518
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,650
Wait, Your Majesty.

519
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,370
- Careful, careful. 
 - Your Majesty!

520
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,980
Oh my.

521
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,300
What? What's wrong?

522
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,350
In... In my stomach...

523
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:37,010
a circus is going on...

524
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,870
What's going on?

525
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:45,320
The water. They still haven't gotten rid of that water!

526
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,130
What kind of water is it?

527
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,970
It's water laced with a poisonous herb.

528
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,210
Poison? Poison!

529
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,280
Court Lady Choi!

530
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,800
You came.

531
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,370
Yes, of course, I came.

532
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,140
It's a banquet to celebrate the queen's recovery.

533
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:15,600
From now on, watch closely and see the results of what your actions have brought.

534
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,070
Preparing food is no easy task!

535
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,800
There's not a place on my body that isn't sore.

536
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,020
On top of that, the royal cook nagged at everything I did.

537
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,060
That rotten—

538
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,400
 Over here! Over here! 

539
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,440
Are there any more potatoes left for me to peel!

540
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,940
Save Court Lady Choi.

541
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,970
Please!

542
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,520
Good work.

543
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,030
I apologize.

544
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,580
The goblin mask?

545
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,770
An old scar on the lower part of the face.

546
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,760
Excuse me.

547
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,140
Oh my—

548
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

549
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,570
Look here, she's having such a hard time.

550
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,450
Do some acupuncture and burn some moxa cones, too!

551
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,350
Give an antidote or something like that!

552
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:25,130
You stay out of this. Over here I'm in charge.

553
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,300
It's all done.

554
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,210
You have unskilled hands in the kitchen, but golden hands in the clinic.

555
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:44,900
Whether a person or thing, they all have a place where they belong.

556
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,240
That needle still fits in better in the kitchen.

557
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,220
No, it doesn't!

558
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,720
There's nothing better than this for skewering potatoes. I'm going to use this.

559
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,890
Don't touch it!

560
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,640
This would work well for peeling potatoes.

561
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,200
I'm going to use these.

562
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,580
No, stop!

563
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,840
Your Majesty!

564
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,320
The party in my stomach has finally stopped.

565
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,550
I shouldn't be here like this.

566
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,820
Your Majesty!

567
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,270
Court Lady Choi!

568
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,530
There's no way she could have recovered that fast.

569
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,210
She's one tough woman.

570
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,060
  The smell of oil? 

571
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,980
Why have you been gone for so long?

572
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,930
I...

573
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:53,670
I'm sorry, my hand slipped and I accidentally shot an arrow at the queen.

574
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,540
Are you hurt... anywhere?

575
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,920
I'm okay.

576
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,580
I was so tired from hunting that I fell asleep while I was changing.

577
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,050
  An apron? 

578
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,730
When is it time for what you prepared, Queen Dowager?

579
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,520
Please, wait.

580
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,340
This is the banquet that the king worked so hard on, it is still his time to shine.

581
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,840
As a way to understand how the people feel, we did not eat until we were full.

582
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:16,650
So, to all of you, the guests, who practiced the manner of scholar today, I have something to say.

583
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,150
With this banquet, we are going to start a gamseon.

584
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,680
 (Gamseon - To set an example for the citizens by reducing the number of extravagant dishes on the royal table) 

585
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,880
Gamseon?

586
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,930
 - Impossible... 
 - Why... 

587
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:33,760
When the country is going through difficult times, the king must decrease his own dishes.

588
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
This is to go through the same pain as the people.

589
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,180
Gamseon is for everyone to go through the same difficulties and solve the problem together.

590
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,810
In times like these, if the grains, which can save the lives of people,

591
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:52,330
turn into one piece of meat just for the tongue's pleasure, that is a sin.

592
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:59,580
Therefore, anyone inside the palace who has meat on his or her plate will be punished.

593
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,960
Not just meat, but also overgenerous servings are also forbidden.

594
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,490
High official subjects, you cannot enjoy drinking and dancing, and must also stop fighting with other factions.

595
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:17,800
If you go against these orders, I will see to it that you get punished.

596
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,370
Your Majesty!

597
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:39,880
I am sorry, but I have unfortunate news.

598
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:16,180
They are sinners who infiltrated the Royal Guard, after concealing their true identity.

599
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,970
They adopted false identities in order to stay close to you.

600
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,230
 This is the time to snap the neck of the pheasants that have their heads hidden. 

601
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,600
 The king must think that this is the foundation of his power, that he has protected and deemed precious. 

602
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,310
 You must uproot it and destroy it completely, 

603
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,020
 so that it cannot ever rise again. 

604
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,230
Why are you ruining this good day?

605
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,400
Do you know the real identities of those people?

606
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,020
One from a family with a history of committing treason and another from a family of thieves,

607
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,860
and yet another who voices criticism against our class system.

608
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,800
Like that, all of these men have contempt and dissatisfaction toward this country.

609
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,870
They have lied about their identities and have been guarding right next to you, Your Majesty.

610
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:28,540
This is because they were plotting treason. So due to its gravity and urgency, I was in a hurry to reveal this matter.

611
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,110
There's no way possible that is true.

612
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,850
This is a trap that someone purposely set to frame my bodyguards

613
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,560
in order to make a gap in my security and to harm me!

614
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,650
Who are you referring to?

615
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:50,540
Such as you, Kim Jwa-geun, General of Military Training.

616
00:57:55,910 --> 00:58:01,550
I don't suppose you are doing this because you feel like you have support from those lords back there?

617
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:07,740
You think they will stand behind you with such words?

618
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:13,060
You are foolish. You must awaken from your delusions.

619
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,270
How dare you!

620
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,920
You dare speak to your superior like that!

621
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,130
This is not only disloyalty but goes as far as treason!

622
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,600
This is not like you, Your Majesty. Please, calm down!

623
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,270
You dare tell the king what to do?

624
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:57,630
There must be something else Your Majesty believes in.

625
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:04,810
However, when a limb is cut off it becomes useless.

626
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:09,070
You must pay for your action of not suppressing your temper.

627
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,510
All these sinners will be beheaded!

628
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:25,040
Your Majesty, I will punish them according to military law!

629
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,220
As they tried to plot treason, they no longer belong to the Royal Guard.

630
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,300
So this matter will be handled by the Royal Investigation Bureau!

631
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:38,080
Your Majesty!

632
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,820
The Royal Guard will handle this case!

633
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,500
 - That cannot happen, Your Majesty! 
 - That cannot happen, Your Majesty! 

634
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,260
The Commander of the Royal Guard must have already known the identities of these sinners!

635
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,450
All the Royal Guard may be traitors!

636
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,790
The Royal Guard taking care of their own corruption matters is unacceptable!

637
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,870
 - Please be understanding! 
 - Please be understanding! 

638
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,340
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

639
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,220
I can even disband the Royal Guard and include its commander in the investigation as well.

640
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:20,230
However, if you hand over the task of punishing the sinners to me,

641
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:25,500
I will take it as a promise that you will not do anything else in the future.

642
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,560
I will stop here.

643
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:57,130
Everything is futile.

644
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:02,060
What will it be, Your Majesty?

645
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,740
All right.

646
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:27,320
I will leave it to you.

647
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,290
"To the four gods who guard the land,

648
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:57,150
and the god who controls the Five Grains,

649
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,040
With your grace, please see to it that the seeds

650
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:09,210
bloom and grow abundantly while everyone is graced by Heaven's wisdom

651
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,730
so that we will live without starvation.

652
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,950
Please."

653
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:19,000
Your Majesty!

654
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,160
   

655
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,760
♫  Where are you?   ♫

656
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,550
♫  Where are you now, my love?   ♫

657
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:53,840
♫   Here I am, here I am   ♫

658
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,410
 His hearing has been injured by the explosion. 

659
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,040
 - Behead them. 
 - There won't be any other problems, will there? 

660
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,510
 - Of course not. 
 - There is no other mastermind? 

661
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,440
 I decided to choose the way I can survive. 

662
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,390
 So, you can't die either.  Hurry and get up so that I can betray you. 

663
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,130
 What's more terrifying is a traitor on the inside. 

664
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:14,510
 Your Majesty the King— 

665
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:17,570
 I'm requesting you to withdraw your regency, Your Highness. 

666
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:18,680
 King! 

667
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,840
 This whole palace killed Kim So-yong. 

668
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:28,090
