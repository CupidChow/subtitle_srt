1
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,470
(The characters in this play are purely fictional
Group events, etc. have nothing to do with history)

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,130
(Episode 1)

3
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,700
No matter how terrible the beast is

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,700
I won't bite the person who gives me food.

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
Instead, it wags its tail

6
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,140
Since I first held a kitchen knife at the age of thirteen

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,100
My dream is to move into the Blue House.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,580
I want to be the most powerful person

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
Cook

10
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,910
This is why I became a chef.

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,890
As you just said

12
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,210
You are the youngest chef in Cheong Wa Dae

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,110
initial

14
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,140
What

15
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,210
Give

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,990
Bighead carp

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,560
That's it.

18
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,420
That that

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,060
The ambassador is particularly sensitive to fish bones.

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,620
Please pay special attention

21
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,963
The ambassador is particularly sensitive to fish bones.

22
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,128
Please pay special attention

23
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,058
Really

24
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,449
Well, dare you tell me this again?

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,940
Be careful or you will become a chopped fish head

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,660
This is something the chef also pays attention to on a daily basis.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,040
You don't have to worry

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,950
Does he think he is Qin Shi Huang?

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,320
Qin Shi Huang

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,430
The development of fish balls was due to Qin Shi Huang

31
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,720
Qin Shi Huang likes to bully people by taking advantage of his power.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,050
He loves fish and eats it every day.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,480
But once you eat a thorn

34
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,320
The chef's head will be mercilessly given to...

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,750
So the chefs in the palace were often replaced.

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,170
One day the new chef thought

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,120
Looks like I'm going to die too.

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,540
So he gave up on himself

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,890
I just put the fish on the knife board and started beating it.

40
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,710
I see

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,160
Well, he's lucky.

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,650
Although we don’t think we’d kill someone for a dish

43
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,480
But it’s not just a dish.

44
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,420
Excellent cuisine

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,700
It can move the heart of the iron wall

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,370
It can be said that it is the most attractive bullet in the world.

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,160
So when cooking at Cheong Wa Dae

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,190
I always think like this

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,490
Cooking is politics

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,850
You also mentioned

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,900
Now let’s talk about something that everyone is curious about.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,350
Let’s get down to business

53
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,830
For example, the behind-the-scenes footage of the Blue House

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,390
Well, before that

55
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,280
Let's talk about one thing first

56
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,190
My name cannot be published

57
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,200
Hard work fee should be paid in cash

58
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:17,980
OK

59
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,990
That?

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,510
It's been broken for a week because of a short circuit.

61
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,190
It was broken by itself.

62
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,440
Or you broke it?

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,600
Sometimes people need to turn a blind eye

64
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,240
Thanks to

65
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,660
I can also enjoy some blessings

66
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,470
But can we really be so leisurely?

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,840
The main dishes are out.

68
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,970
The game is over

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,270
Now the Chinese ambassador estimates

70
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,330
They are all tasting the taste of heaven

71
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,480
quick

72
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,810
Go find him

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,620
Chef Zhang

74
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,640
Where are you

75
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,700
Really

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,340
Looking for me too much is also very tiring

77
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,430
To fall in love with my cooking, the ambassador has to praise me personally

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,920
Wait for me Sunyoung

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,260
I am Hai Jing

80
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,350
Sunyoung is a more suitable name for you.

81
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,150
(Episode 1: Strange Country's Jang Bong-hwan)

82
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,240
(Be careful of dogs that may bite you)

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,350
I was scared to death

84
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Hello

85
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,520
You come

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Zhang Fenghuan

87
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,110
We are the police from the Criminal Division of Jongno Police Station.

88
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,470
no

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,040
That guy Jang Bong-hwan

90
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,190
Why is your last name Zhang?

91
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,360
Everyone calls him Chef Zhang
(same as chef)

92
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,150
I feel like I lost to him starting from the name.

93
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,860
As long as we can cooperate with Hanshi Tianxia in the future

94
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,910
A name to be known all over the world

95
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,790
It's husband Shengmin

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,150
Not Zhang Fenghuan

97
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,070
Do it well

98
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,480
Remember to keep it confidential

99
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,190
Of course

100
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,350
Don't let yourself get misunderstood.

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,010
We are such clean people.

102
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,580
oops

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Oops, you scared us.

104
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,030
Please come with us to the office.

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,360
No, that matter has been concluded.

106
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,050
I also took responsibility and quit my job.

107
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,930
What's wrong?

108
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,840
We found you suspected

109
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,090
Fraud in food supply

110
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,200
How much fraud

111
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,510
Up to two years

112
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,520
I guess it's a lot of money.

113
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,220
So the evidence just happened to point to me?

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, who said that?

115
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,600
Just a reference survey

116
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,460
Really bad acting

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,230
Can we open the door now?

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,700
Even our police officers should know this.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,060
This kind of thing happens in the Blue House

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,920
Can it be decided by a chef?

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,580
Fu Shengmin that guy

122
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,650
But the person who stayed in the Blue House kitchen the longest

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,990
He is the defect itself

124
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,630
He must have colluded with someone above him.

125
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,540
Then they framed me

126
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,900
Uh-huh, so

127
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,870
You have to go to the office with us.

128
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,060
Tell us everything you know.

129
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,950
I used to think

130
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,250
Just to fire me.

131
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,680
Is it worth spending so much energy?

132
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,720
That's how it is.

133
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,870
In this case, he should at least be the chief secretary.

134
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,790
Is it Director Han?

135
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,830
Why did you suddenly start talking to yourself?

136
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,010
It's so urgent now

137
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,030
Why could that be?

138
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,260
Of course, it's stalling for time.

139
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,090
But we don't have time

140
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,970
do what

141
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,740
Jang Bong-hwan stopped

142
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,730
He's also very impatient.

143
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,630
I will hire a lawyer to investigate the situation.

144
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,090
Then I'll find you

145
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Our police officer

146
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,610
Don't you also need to catch the criminal to get promoted?

147
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,440
OK

148
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,730
Did you hear that?

149
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,510
OK OK

150
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,500
Go back. It's time to go home.

151
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,160
Brat

152
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,620
Hello

153
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,020
That puppy

154
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,740
That's why I told you to be careful with the dog.

155
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Don't come over here

156
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,460
Zhang Fenghuan, you will get into trouble if you do that.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,940
Don't move

158
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,110
Damn

159
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,410
That's right

160
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,290
I have an important question

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,040
Can I ask?

162
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,090
What to ask

163
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,350
Why do people in detention centers always order rice sausage soup?

164
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,810
What the hell are you asking?

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,410
I really hate rice sausage soup.

166
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,600
Is the police station your home cafeteria?

167
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,570
Is this a rest area on the highway?

168
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,770
I want to choose the menu myself

169
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm a chef.

170
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,680
In such a crisis situation

171
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,000
A man who only thinks about cooking

172
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,720
Chef Zhang

173
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,100
Stop being funny.

174
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,130
Don't let go Don't let go

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,700
Damn

176
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,480
Almost died

177
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,280
It's really beautiful, right?

178
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,480
no

179
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,660
I have so many women

180
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,390
I haven't dated before.

181
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,590
Help

182
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,290
I don't want to die

183
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,810
I really don't want to die

184
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,280
here

185
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,390
It's heaven

186
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,260
No, I have to live.

187
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,260
But this cloth...

188
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,140
Would you bury me completely?

189
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,770
No

190
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,780
But also

191
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,440
How can I go to heaven?

192
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,490
Although I didn't do anything bad

193
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,730
But didn't do anything good.

194
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,400
But this place with a lot of historical flavor is...

195
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,050
Hanok Village

196
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,520
But I fell from such a high place.

197
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,040
Why is there nothing wrong with my body?

198
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,340
Sure enough, men still need to do some lower body exercises

199
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm fine, right?

200
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,960
My precious...

201
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,660
Why are there no muscles?

202
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,170
Where have all my beloved muscles gone?

203
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,000
Damn

204
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,790
No wonder they say that if you don't exercise your muscles they will turn into fat

205
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,650
How long did I lie there?

206
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,560
What's going on?

207
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,320
Dream

208
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,440
I've come back from the dead and I still dream about women

209
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,210
I really am a dog that can't change its eating habits.

210
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,310
But shouldn't I dream of making love with a woman?

211
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,160
Why did I dream of becoming a woman?

212
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,160
What's going on?

213
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,660
Oh, there is only one word difference between nightmare and wet dream

214
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,720
But why does this woman look so familiar?

215
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,680
Did you see it on Instagram?

216
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,130
No, we even had close contact.

217
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,260
The relationship should be not shallow

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,760
Soo-yeon

219
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,090
Caiying

220
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,080
Water Ghost

221
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,600
Even the voice has changed

222
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,520
Niangniang

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,030
My lady, you finally woke up

224
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,150
I knew you would wake up.

225
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,280
Very good

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,680
It's really great

227
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,430
Please don't move

228
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,440
What happened? What happened?

229
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,320
You haven't recovered yet.

230
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
Small...

231
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,230
That's right

232
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,630
If you want to do it, you have to dream like this

233
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,980
How beautiful...

234
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,100
What the hell

235
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,150
It's too hard to drink.

236
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,790
Is that posture inconvenient for drinking?

237
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,660
What kind of dream is so real even to the taste?

238
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,030
I'll add more licorice and cook it again for you

239
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,970
Could it be

240
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,460
Not dreaming

241
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,870
This is the end

242
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
What's going on?

243
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,870
It's all small mistakes.

244
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,790
I really shouldn't have left you.

245
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm really sorry.

246
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,800
From now on, I will never leave you for a moment.

247
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,360
Niangniang

248
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,920
Niangniang

249
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,950
Niangniang

250
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,600
Niangniang

251
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,390
Niangniang

252
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,220
Oops Oops Oops

253
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,940
oops

254
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,160
Oh my god

255
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,970
Niangniang

256
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,740
Niangniang

257
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,040
Niangniang

258
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,840
oops

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
Really

260
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,390
Niangniang

261
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,170
What are they chasing me for? It's scary.

262
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,990
Madam, please don't run so fast.

263
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,960
Where are you going?

264
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,130
Niangniang

265
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,600
Madam, where are you going?

266
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,110
It's dangerous for you to run so fast.

267
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,850
oops

268
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,960
Oh my god

269
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,910
MILF

270
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,700
Niangniang

271
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,420
Damn

272
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,970
Oh my god, what happened?

273
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,500
She is not Hong Gil-dong, how can she run so fast?

274
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,360
Niangniang

275
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,590
Madam, please stop.

276
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,350
Madam, please stop.

277
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,770
Niangniang

278
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,540
Where's the palace?

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,340
strangeness

280
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,440
Everything is weird, sissy.

281
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,960
If this isn't a dream, then what is it?

282
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,330
what is going on

283
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,880
My Lady, My Lady, My Lady...

284
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,340
Niangniang

285
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,420
But what's really strange is

286
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,190
They all ran like this.

287
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,870
The weird thing is that I didn't feel anything at all.

288
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,580
No

289
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,890
How could there not be?

290
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,540
Oh, how can such a thing...

291
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,270
mine

292
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,270
Mine

293
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,260
What are you looking for

294
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,720
I'll find the small one for you.

295
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,030
Don't come near me

296
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,850
I

297
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,970
He's actually a eunuch

298
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,180
Niangniang

299
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,600
It's really bad that you suddenly act like this

300
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,040
What on earth did you do to me?

301
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,700
First of all, for the health of the body

302
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,100
Please accept the imperial physician's diagnosis first.

303
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,080
I don't care whether there is an imperial doctor or not.

304
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,770
Who dares to appear in front of me?

305
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,170
I made him a eunuch

306
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,640
What's going on?

307
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,460
Unreasonable

308
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,070
Even if it's human trafficking, this is not acceptable.

309
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,710
How can you tie up a man and perform sex reassignment surgery?

310
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,490
Who are you guys?

311
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,980
Who has such deep hatred towards me?

312
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,460
What

313
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,260
Is it Director Han?

314
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,890
Is that why I had surgery?

315
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,300
Is he the chief secretary?

316
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,990
It can be so lawless

317
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,270
Did you change the gender of a person?

318
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,720
But

319
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,170
Why are you all dressed like this?

320
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,940
It's like I've traveled through time.

321
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,890
What

322
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,270
What was your birth month?

323
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,680
May 31, 1988 Gemini

324
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,870
Where do you live?

325
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,810
32 Sampoong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul

326
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,390
Regent Apartment No. 1305

327
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,880
Your parents' names are...

328
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,490
Father Zhang Qiling Mother Li Xiuzhen

329
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,920
One is a Chinese teacher and the other is a history teacher.

330
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,630
I was born in a group of diligent educators

331
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,140
Sudden mutation of mad dog's only child

332
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,590
Do I need to tell you all these things?

333
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,670
Can you tickle me?

334
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,490
Is that so?

335
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,690
It's not a dream.

336
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,610
The feeling is too vivid

337
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,590
It's just my soul.

338
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,590
Traveled into this woman's body

339
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,910
Dreams can wait until you wake up

340
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,050
You can come in and go out

341
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,760
I said

342
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,900
What happened to this woman?

343
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,080
Tell me what you know

344
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,510
This woman?

345
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,880
I mean I

346
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,670
What happened to me

347
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,100
It's all my fault

348
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,940
I didn't even know you sneaked out.

349
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,660
Please kill me, my lady.

350
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,340
Would your death solve my problem?

351
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,450
Kill if you can solve it

352
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,430
But it's not

353
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,670
Okay, okay.

354
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,970
Calm down

355
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,660
Don't cry, don't cry

356
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,450
very good

357
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,970
So when am I

358
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,410
Where did one go?

359
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,000
That is...

360
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,930
Last night, my lady, you said you were too tired

361
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,060
Want to go to bed early

362
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,730
I've confirmed that you fell asleep.

363
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,650
All that needs to be done has been done

364
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,050
This late at night

365
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,490
Are we still going to do our own night patrols?

366
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,900
They all have two years of experience in the palace.

367
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,310
Is it that amazing?

368
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,120
He is the eldest brother of His Majesty.

369
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,040
He is still the best friend of His Majesty.

370
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,550
Of course, more decent

371
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,360
As expected, she has become a member of the palace.

372
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,800
That's right

373
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,840
Did you hear that?

374
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,640
Is it a woman's or a ghost's thing?

375
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,470
Every time you talk to someone in such a low voice

376
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,920
It's one of the two

377
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,190
It's a ghost story

378
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,580
It turns out that both are

379
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,620
It's the water ghost that appeared in the lake ahead.

380
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,560
oops

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,550
The two of them immediately jumped into the lake to save you.

382
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,890
We have all had our pulse checked and everything is fine.

383
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,900
But I don't know why all day

384
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,370
I can't wake up

385
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,310
And you just woke up not long ago, right?

386
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,610
Yes, it's water.

387
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,930
I and this woman both fell into the water.

388
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,720
It is exchanged through water.

389
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,090
Let's go

390
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,160
Go over there

391
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,820
I told you not to follow me.

392
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,360
I just

393
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,190
I can't remember why I fell into the water.

394
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,230
I just wanted to go there to have a look.

395
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,120
Okay?

396
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,930
Hey, these followers

397
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,520
They will definitely stop me from jumping into the lake.

398
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,480
Why

399
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,280
Are we heading there?

400
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,450
We are all in the palace, why is it so far away?

401
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,830
Already arrived at the empress

402
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,120
That's near the stone tablet.

403
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,830
(Spring Pond)
That's near the stone tablet.

404
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,100
(Spring Pond)

405
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,960
To surprise attack

406
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,750
MILF

407
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,530
Niangniang

408
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,910
Niangniang

409
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,130
Niangniang

410
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,930
You can't be like this, lady.

411
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,120
My lady, you can't do this

412
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,510
Niangniang

413
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,610
Danger

414
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,370
go back

415
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,960
Back to my own life

416
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,390
Back to my precious body

417
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,190
From now on I must do some good deeds occasionally

418
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,000
God, Buddha, Virgin Mary

419
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,880
Niangniang

420
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,910
Niangniang

421
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,470
Are you really not injured?

422
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,080
How can there be no water in the lake?

423
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,420
Did any drought happen in one day?

424
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,910
To prevent the accident from happening again

425
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,660
Drain all the water, my lady.

426
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,020
Why did you tell me

427
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,380
Sorry, Madam.

428
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,710
Yes, my lady, yes, my lady

429
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh my god, this sound of my lady

430
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,480
I feel like vomiting after listening to this.

431
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,810
Why am I a queen?

432
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,860
My wife is in a bad mood now

433
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,060
You all call her Miss.

434
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,240
yes

435
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,130
Madam, what is that?

436
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,590
Although it has passed the selection

437
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,010
But the ceremony has not yet begun.

438
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,270
She is still a queen

439
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,790
Selection

440
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,270
Then I am

441
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,070
You are the one who will become the middle temple

442
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,420
You're saying I am

443
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,730
The one who will become the king's wife?

444
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,690
Yes

445
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,540
Oh, I'm going crazy. Really.

446
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,200
The little panic lady is not a lady

447
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,170
How can you be so handsome?

448
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,510
Really handsome

449
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,250
The hands look nice too.

450
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,210
what to do

451
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,270
Your Highness

452
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,000
An hour has passed.

453
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,030
To take care of yourself, just stop reading here today.

454
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,760
Shangshan is the king in charge of a country.

455
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,280
Is there anything more important than having an heir?

456
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,810
Although I feel very tired and exhausted

457
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,350
But we can't stop moving forward

458
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,160
Even if I give in a hundred times and get on a time machine

459
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,480
But how could it be a woman?

460
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,180
Plus she's not just an ordinary woman.

461
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,210
But the nave

462
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm a non-marriageist.

463
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,450
Why should I become the king's wife?

464
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,110
Wait a moment

465
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,800
The middle hall means the royal family.

466
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,250
Do you want to go straight to the bathroom?

467
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,970
Miss

468
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,360
Call me empress

469
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,610
Call any name

470
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,760
Good lady, good lady

471
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,250
I'm the queen, right?

472
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,720
Yes, my lady, yes, my lady

473
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,440
I mean I'm the best.

474
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,770
It always sounds hard to hear.

475
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,580
But it suddenly sounded good.

476
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,960
Hello

477
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,990
Let's fill this lake now.

478
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,910
This is the command

479
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,060
There is such a simple method

480
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,220
No, my lady.

481
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,630
What

482
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,720
Oh, did you become obedient after being severely punished?

483
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,830
Spare my life, slave girl deserves death

484
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,010
Spare my life, slave girl deserves death

485
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,820
But please spare my life.

486
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,950
What? Why is it so exaggerated?

487
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,340
The Crown Princess finally woke up

488
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,950
Just woke up and bullied the palace maids

489
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,290
It seems like she has fully recovered.

490
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,300
Please let her come over.

491
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,460
Good Your Highness

492
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,180
Your Majesty, Your Highness asked you to go to the pavilion.

493
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Your Highness, Your Highness Your Highness, Your Highness

494
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,780
My Lord?

495
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,030
oops

496
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,590
The boss here

497
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,560
It's really full of vitality

498
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,240
Hey, Your Majesty

499
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,530
Why are you like this?

500
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,860
This is not important

501
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,350
How could it not be important?

502
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,400
Always dress neatly

503
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,330
Keep an upright heart

504
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,510
I see

505
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,570
I have an emergency now

506
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,300
Scholars must get up when they hear the cock crow and dress neatly

507
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,300
Be sincere

508
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,930
Yes, you need to develop a mindset.

509
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,250
I'll read these later

510
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,870
I'm really anxious

511
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,150
I need water now

512
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,820
Hello

513
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,520
Bring a glass of water to the lady.

514
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,360
No no

515
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,120
I mean

516
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,660
Need lake water

517
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,390
All the water in those lakes has been pumped out.

518
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,530
Ah, you mean

519
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,360
Fill up the lake right now, right?

520
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,130
Yeah yeah

521
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,220
no

522
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,930
Why

523
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,930
This is an order from the Queen Mother herself.

524
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,000
If my lake is filled up

525
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,760
It's disobedience

526
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,880
Aren't you the king?

527
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,770
How can a king not decide?

528
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,010
The matter of filling the lake with water

529
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,740
Understand that I was frightened by the accident.

530
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,480
Still worried

531
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,960
The Queen Mother's Thoughts

532
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,350
I also think that pumping the water away is the right thing to do.

533
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,440
Why do you think it's right?

534
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,550
Give me a scientific explanation.

535
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,330
No reason

536
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,920
Are you kidding me?

537
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,060
Who are you attacking?

538
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,740
I think you are a very good scholar.

539
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,240
Cover your nose in front of others

540
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,510
It seems not in accordance with etiquette

541
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,910
I'm so lucky to see you're doing well.

542
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm worried about you

543
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,460
Yeah

544
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,490
I can feel your sincerity

545
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,240
But is your tone like this?

546
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,450
After a narrow escape

547
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,010
I feel a lot of dissatisfaction with the world

548
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,860
How did you fall into the lake?

549
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,090
At once

550
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,890
Lost that part of my memory

551
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,000
Just this part?

552
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,810
That's weird.

553
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,790
Oh, you are reading the Four Histories

554
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,880
Zhou Yi's words are the most powerful

555
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,030
I don't like people touching my books.

556
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,410
Oh, I've already touched it.

557
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,280
Just let me take a look

558
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,100
oops

559
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,170
The husband sings and the wife follows, the daughter must follow in death

560
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,220
A woman must obey her husband

561
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,730
That's what I said.

562
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,140
You said women must die

563
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,430
Feeding Yin cannot go against Yang

564
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,330
Since ancient times, wives have been required to obey their husbands.

565
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,580
Is this the Joseon era?

566
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,020
Joseon era

567
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,310
Is the king here?

568
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,380
I am the king

569
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,480
Why

570
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,510
Really

571
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,930
hateful

572
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,940
Letting go

573
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,840
Hello

574
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,350
Hello

575
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,140
What's wrong with you?

576
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,530
Seems a bit suspicious

577
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,020
His Majesty the Lord

578
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,010
Now it's time to go to the palace.

579
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes, it's here so soon.

580
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,050
A day when a king is in charge of a country

581
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,480
It's like flapping its wings.

582
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,530
OK

583
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,550
You seem to be busy, so I'll leave first.

584
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,730
no

585
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,030
Shangshan

586
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,600
exist

587
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,260
Feed Shangshan

588
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,470
You know I love books.

589
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,810
Old age and limited mobility

590
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,780
Your hand slipped, Your Highness

591
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,690
The price of the book

592
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,560
Three times higher than your monthly allowance

593
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,930
Please give me death

594
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,280
How can this be?

595
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,240
Even if books are precious

596
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,730
How can it compare to your life?

597
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,360
Your Majesty,

598
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,340
You care about learning just like me.

599
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,100
I will prepare a new book for you

600
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,230
Because I have a meeting with the emperor, I'm leaving now.

601
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,850
Hello

602
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,500
Call the sedan chair.

603
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,460
Let's sit together.

604
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,030
Wider than I thought

605
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,870
No

606
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,790
It's too crowded to sit together

607
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,450
And you go wash it.

608
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,680
Let's go

609
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,030
What kind of character is that person?

610
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,590
Why

611
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,080
Niangniang

612
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,090
You can't sit like this.

613
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,390
Leg pain

614
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,710
Memory loss

615
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,220
This is not just memory loss.

616
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,820
On the eve of the sacrifice, the illness worsened.

617
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,970
The delusion of a makeshift way to avoid reality

618
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,010
People who are here now

619
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,460
Only the Queen Mother and I

620
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,470
What if those words just now

621
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,720
It reached my ears through others

622
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,770
There will never be such a thing

623
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,110
We must find a way to heal the nave.

624
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,810
yes

625
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,900
A child who doesn't even know his own name

626
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,020
How can I take the position of the mother of the nation?

627
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,570
Tell her your name

628
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,870
Can't we just help her regain her memory?

629
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,840
Please don't worry

630
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,720
Want to meet in person?

631
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
There are so many eyes watching

632
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,660
There is no need to confirm even the family elders

633
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,270
The appearance is incomparable

634
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,680
I will try my best to send someone to contact and resolve it.

635
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,360
But what about the central temple?

636
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,770
Why Alone

637
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,120
Going out at this late hour?

638
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,920
I wonder if it's someone

639
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,570
Called her by her master's name

640
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,930
If it is a royal decree, it is hard to doubt it.

641
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,430
Who is it?

642
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,050
Are you awake?

643
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,000
Really

644
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,290
It seems my spell worked.

645
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,170
The effect of the dragon's face

646
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,060
Bring it often.

647
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,410
Interesting news

648
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,730
Is this something suitable to be discussed in the world?

649
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,000
The one who is destined to be enthroned in the harem

650
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,260
Pushed the nave into the lake

651
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,980
The canonization of the harem will be cancelled

652
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,870
Is her name Zhao Huazhen?

653
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,510
Yes

654
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,920
There's no excuse.

655
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,580
Although the already weakened Fengrang Zhao clan

656
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,350
The extinguished fire

657
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,780
Always be vigilant

658
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,770
Because of the removal

659
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,220
Opinions on repairing roads of different sizes diverge

660
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,760
We want to know your Majesty's opinion.

661
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,610
My opinion

662
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,650
Big...big road

663
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,860
small road...

664
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,050
this

665
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,230
What's the big deal?

666
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,470
What about the main road?

667
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,560
It is advocated to remove

668
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,090
Huge financial losses are inevitable

669
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,820
How about a phased reduction via small roads?

670
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,730
My opinion

671
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,350
Exactly

672
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,640
Next up

673
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,450
The most urgent national marriage issue

674
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,080
Although the ministers don’t know yet

675
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,870
The palace finally woke up

676
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,290
Your Highness

677
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,020
In fact, after waking up, the Queen

678
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,390
Rumors of unusual appearance

679
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,430
Rumor spread in the palace

680
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,260
Yeah

681
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,220
I first heard

682
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,660
After Zhongdian woke up

683
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,720
I also met by chance

684
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,480
I'm the slowest one

685
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,730
I am the slowest

686
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,630
Just a rumor

687
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,290
I'm worried that His Majesty will be upset.

688
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,180
That’s why the ministers didn’t make any memorials.

689
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,980
It actually has such a deep meaning

690
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,880
We just

691
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,500
I thought it wasn't a rumor

692
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,630
Seeing the central hall is indeed different from usual

693
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,870
After the accident, he said he had lost his memory.

694
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,230
The degree of memory loss due to the shock

695
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,560
Is it in danger?

696
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,390
Is it dangerous

697
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,890
The Queen Mother fell into the water

698
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,110
Not just an accident

699
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,950
What

700
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,070
At that moment

701
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,440
A palace servant said that when passing by the lake

702
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,850
I saw a strange woman

703
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,230
Who is she?

704
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,050
Confirmed the log book

705
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,960
Found out at that moment

706
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,330
There was only one woman allowed in and out of the palace.

707
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,370
She is Zhao Dashou's daughter.

708
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,290
Zhao Huazhen

709
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,700
How can you say something like this that makes people take the blame?

710
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,250
She didn't

711
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,160
The reason for hurting the Queen

712
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,400
She is the one chosen by the harem

713
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,750
Because I want the position in the nave

714
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,670
That's why you hurt the Queen, right?

715
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,650
This is the wronged prince.

716
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,520
Zhao Dashou

717
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,080
A loyal minister known for his integrity

718
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,760
His daughter too

719
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,670
Virtuous

720
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,240
Fame

721
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,650
This is rebellion

722
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,670
How dare you say such a thing?

723
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,080
Why did Zhao Huazhen sneak into the palace?

724
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,140
Aren't you here to see the Queen Mother?

725
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,950
What are you talking about now?

726
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,640
Will be punished by God

727
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,440
Your Highness

728
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,130
Please find clear facts

729
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,230
I am terrified

730
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,950
This is really

731
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,810
Embarrassing

732
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,780
Zhao Huazhen

733
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,450
Be with me that night

734
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,590
All night

735
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,570
What

736
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,920
certainly

737
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,420
This is before the ceremony.

738
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,020
She hasn't been allowed into the harem yet.

739
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,580
But because of my youth and vigor

740
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,720
but

741
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,970
Don't you all know this?

742
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,050
It was the ministers who heard the news faster than me.

743
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,490
Now that things have come to this

744
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,870
Complete the national wedding quickly

745
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,970
Let her enter the harem immediately

746
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,650
how

747
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,170
that

748
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,480
The course of the case

749
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,990
As long as the nave regains his memory

750
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,470
Everything can be solved

751
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,950
Don't jump to conclusions too quickly

752
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,440
The court is so divided

753
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,540
Biting each other

754
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,620
What can be accomplished?

755
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,510
Right?

756
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,290
If the ceremony is held like this

757
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,810
It will be the Jin family's world.

758
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,830
The Lord loves Zhao Huazhen so much

759
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,700
There should be a chance to redeem myself.

760
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,060
after

761
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,390
The fate of our Pungyang Zhao clan

762
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,620
It depends on Zhao Huazhen.

763
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,100
first

764
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,550
Settle down in the harem without any trouble

765
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,400
Gather more talents.

766
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,540
The national wedding can be successfully concluded

767
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,800
Why

768
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,590
His face is so dark

769
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,750
There's going to be a tough fight soon, isn't there?

770
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,790
Because of my shortcomings

771
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,720
The Queen Mother has to work hard every time.

772
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,130
I am terrified

773
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,560
What's the hard work?

774
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,170
The Lord's ability to govern the court is also gradually increasing.

775
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,310
You're flattered.

776
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,370
Just relying on the Queen Mother

777
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,440
Just moving forward reluctantly

778
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,790
Back to the point

779
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,190
I didn't notice your youthfulness.

780
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,900
I am terrified

781
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,490
I'm scared

782
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,610
I couldn't prepare for you in advance

783
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,020
but

784
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,880
A balanced attitude towards women is also important

785
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,920
After all, palace maids are also one of the core of the court.

786
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,840
Don't forget

787
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,200
The nave is more important than the harem

788
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,930
I will remember

789
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,020
besides

790
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,790
Who is the woman the palace servant said she saw?

791
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,010
Must find out

792
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,830
We can't let the Central Palace fall into danger again.

793
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,400
yes

794
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,250
you're right

795
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,460
Sorry Miss

796
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,350
what to do

797
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,180
It's written so well.

798
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,300
This poem

799
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,710
I wrote it with you.

800
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,840
Thanks to you, I became more beautiful

801
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,810
Miss, you are really

802
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,510
Miss

803
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,590
Miyasato

804
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,600
Come to the throne

805
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,070
Obey the command of His Majesty

806
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,050
Zhao Dashou's daughter Zhao Huazhen

807
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,820
Tomorrow, after the ceremony of His Majesty the Lord

808
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,370
Will be immediately canonized by the harem

809
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,920
Come to the palace as soon as possible.

810
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,640
Really cool

811
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,230
Add some cold water

812
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,210
Add water

813
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,670
Keep adding, keep adding, keep adding

814
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,380
Yes, water

815
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,470
Here's the Problem

816
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,980
Fall into other water

817
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,310
Can I go back?

818
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,830
I fell into the water anyway.

819
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,490
Are there no other lakes nearby?

820
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,190
There are two more places in the palace alone.

821
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:39,740
Yeah

822
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,160
Yes

823
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,050
Although the other lakes are the same now

824
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,830
What does this mean?

825
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,310
The Queen Mother gave the order

826
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,900
The lake in the palace

827
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,330
Clean it all up

828
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,870
Lake

829
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,000
All?

830
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,210
It's the queen

831
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,050
Till what time

832
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,800
forever

833
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,780
Niangniang

834
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,690
So what this means is

835
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,810
I

836
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,060
Do you want to live like this?

837
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,560
Forever?

838
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,480
Niangniang

839
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,860
water

840
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,290
I'll try whatever water it is.

841
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,650
I want to go back

842
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,910
Niangniang

843
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:31,680
Niangniang

844
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,070
Niangniang

845
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,320
This is dirty water.

846
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,310
Niangniang

847
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,850
Niangniang

848
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,360
Can't

849
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,460
Niangniang

850
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,100
I can't move

851
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,740
Lower your butt

852
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,160
Niangniang

853
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,100
Please take out your head.

854
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,400
Can't

855
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,280
If it's not that lake water, it won't work.

856
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,230
How big will the impact be?

857
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,820
As soon as I see water, I always mutate

858
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,650
What's your name, our lovely one?

859
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,340
My name is Honglian

860
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,360
red lotus

861
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,260
If even from birth

862
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,000
I forgot about serving the queen.

863
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,940
in the end

864
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,150
How serious is the illness?

865
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,470
Why are you crying? It makes me sad.

866
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,470
I'm here to present the Korean medicine.

867
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,910
How can I let people see my tears?

868
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,160
The one who is suffering the most now is my aunt.

869
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,550
Fear

870
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,070
Yeah, I feel the worst.

871
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,110
This sense of loss

872
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,810
You two won't understand.

873
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,880
You go out first

874
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,180
Anyway, there is no chance of going back as soon as possible.

875
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,720
If you want to stay here,

876
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,020
Need intelligence

877
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:41,630
but

878
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
The one I just met

879
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,660
What do you call someone with a trashy expression?

880
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,230
I asked you what is the king's name?

881
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,340
How dare I use the name of the supreme king

882
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,630
That's right

883
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,140
You can't call or use the king's name, right?

884
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,400
Now is the Joseon era

885
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,690
When exactly?

886
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,170
The 29th year of Daoguang reign of Joseon

887
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,090
The second year after the king ascended the throne

888
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,020
Daoguang Palace

889
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,020
Daoguang

890
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,590
I've clearly heard of it.

891
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,840
Please give me some more hints.

892
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,440
carry

893
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,280
Show?

894
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,900
Then I sing a song

895
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,990
If the king's name is revealed, give me a signal.

896
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:21,830
Listen carefully

897
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,820
Taizong Taishi Wenruishi

898
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,340
Yeoseongjunjungrenmyeongsun

899
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,100
Not yet?

900
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,420
It seems to be still far behind.

901
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,610
Kwang In Hyeon Yeon Suk Kyung Yeong

902
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,230
Zhengchun Xianzhegao

903
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,890
high

904
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,900
Gao Zhexianchun

905
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,440
Junxian

906
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,410
Why are there still small flying insects?

907
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,460
Words after Xianzong

908
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,580
Cheoljong

909
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,290
Cheoljong's real name was Yi Won-beom

910
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,410
After becoming king, he changed his name to Li Heng

911
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,710
The whole family was drawn into the struggle

912
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,000
Exiled to Ganghwa Island

913
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,520
Depressed all day

914
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,810
One day I woke up early and became the king's gray girl

915
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,150
As the most ignorant and incompetent puppet king

916
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,950
Let the people suffer

917
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,280
Died of illness after fourteen years in office

918
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,870
It is indeed dangerous to be born into a royal family.

919
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,090
Long live my mother

920
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,560
The rich in Silla are scary.

921
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,530
The ruler of Silla was truly extraordinary as a king.

922
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,470
I don't even know the status of the nave.

923
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,750
How heartless!

924
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,370
Let me take a look

925
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,200
What to do

926
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,020
There's no need to be shy

927
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,940
Tomorrow we will be husband and wife.

928
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,160
Tomorrow?

929
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,480
The ceremony was postponed due to an accident

930
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,300
I asked them to prepare quickly.

931
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,700
Tomorrow

932
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,590
Our Gift Ceremony

933
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,580
OH MY GOD

934
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,630
I forgot the most important thing

935
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,230
Let Cheoljong indulge in women

936
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,650
And he was famous for neglecting state affairs.

937
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,750
The representative demon queen of the Joseon Dynasty

938
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,280
Wait a moment

939
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,110
There is one thing you need to know before that.

940
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,110
As the Central Palace wishes

941
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,110
I've told everyone not to get close.

942
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,620
Is it ok now?

943
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,000
that is

944
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,790
This might be a little hard to accept.

945
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,080
I don't know how to explain this.

946
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,890
What's Here

947
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,970
What's wrong

948
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,220
It's the petals.

949
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,670
Anyway, although you will feel the shock

950
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,290
But try to accept it.

951
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,300
I actually

952
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,190
In fact

953
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,570
Is a man

954
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,030
About two hundred years later

955
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,900
I am a healthy person in Korea

956
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,160
Although I don't know what happened

957
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,070
I thought I was going to die after falling into the water.

958
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,380
I opened my eyes and it became like this

959
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,520
Anyway, I

960
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,750
It's not what you think.

961
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,410
It means that what you see is not all.

962
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,430
I'm sure you think this is nonsense.

963
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,530
But you

964
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,250
You really have to make a good judgement.

965
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,710
Even if you want to get married

966
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,670
But the first night

967
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,900
This really isn't possible.

968
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,860
Men are really not my type.

969
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,120
this

970
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,560
It's more of a problem for you.

971
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,260
I am mainly concerned about the issue of legitimacy

972
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,270
But for you

973
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,260
This is a fraudulent marriage.

974
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,550
It's a crime

975
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,590
I see

976
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,430
did you mean

977
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,290
Really

978
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,460
you

979
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,400
It's different from what I read in history books.

980
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,680
Very wise.

981
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,690
Come on over here

982
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,320
It's your highness

983
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,370
Call the imperial physician immediately.

984
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,520
Accurately grasp the princess's status

985
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,650
Cure her.

986
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,900
Don't worry

987
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,920
I don't care what method I use

988
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,720
It will help you get relaxed

989
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,190
Don't forget

990
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,260
You are not a man

991
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,140
No matter how depressed I am

992
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,000
Made a mess out of imagination

993
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,260
I will be your king forever

994
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,400
this

995
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,830
It seems that your body is not well yet.

996
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,620
here

997
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,770
Come and serve quickly

998
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,700
It's your highness

999
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,100
Don't worry too much

1000
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,650
Go back and rest

1001
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,020
It'll be fine

1002
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,980
Everything will be alright.

1003
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,600
It's okay. It's okay.

1004
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,530
Books don't lie.

1005
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,530
It may be even more useless than what the history books say.

1006
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,100
Have a good rest

1007
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,440
OK Got it

1008
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,150
Niangniang

1009
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,470
You can't lift up your skirt.

1010
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,710
My lady, you can't show the inside.

1011
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:39,840
My lady, please walk slowly.

1012
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,300
This can't be done

1013
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,940
What is the careful thought?

1014
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,400
No, I won't eat.

1015
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,510
I prefer Western medicine to Korean medicine.

1016
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,500
Your Highness

1017
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,340
ah

1018
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,790
Really

1019
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,490
So I

1020
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,840
Because the evil breath entered the head

1021
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,930
Need to use the rhythm of medicine to fill it

1022
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,740
Niangniang

1023
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,600
You must find yourself

1024
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,040
You old fashioned

1025
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,410
You don't have any ideas?

1026
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,810
Why sit by the fire?

1027
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,190
To open the 13 acupoints for the treatment of spiritual direction

1028
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,230
Okay, it's up to you.

1029
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,520
It's not my body anyway.

1030
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,790
I remembered

1031
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,640
Magical, I remember everything.

1032
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,570
red lotus

1033
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,370
We grew up together since we were in this family.

1034
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,690
My very precious slave

1035
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,310
here

1036
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,000
What's this person's name?

1037
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,450
Who are you

1038
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,770
Cui

1039
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,730
Cui

1040
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,160
Choi Sang-Gong

1041
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:44,730
So

1042
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,620
What's my name?

1043
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,450
How do I know your name?

1044
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,860
Everyone gather together

1045
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,120
Hurry up and hold the lady down

1046
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,920
If you move it accidentally, something bad will happen.

1047
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,660
Use this big needle to pierce it

1048
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,260
Is it crazy to treat people like this?

1049
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,470
My main skill is acupuncture

1050
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,670
Unblock blocked acupoints

1051
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,330
It's best to use this

1052
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,690
Put this on the back of your neck

1053
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,550
Stop

1054
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,180
Please stop

1055
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,270
If I cheer up,

1056
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,370
From tomorrow on, it will be the middle temple.

1057
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,910
The overtreated nave

1058
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,870
What will it cost you?

1059
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,630
All things are better in excess than in deficiency

1060
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,870
My powerful medical skills only go so far

1061
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:40,260
I almost

1062
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,700
I started to curse.

1063
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,760
Already well

1064
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,640
Already well

1065
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,260
The princess everyone wants to be

1066
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,290
I'll be

1067
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,620
She is nominally a princess of a country.

1068
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:52,760
Fill the pond with water

1069
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,200
Can't I just do it as I please?

1070
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,900
Niangniang

1071
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,600
It's time to wake up

1072
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:54,880
Your Highness

1073
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,680
Do you have to wear all of these?

1074
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,590
(Palace dress set)

1075
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,290
Close fitting panties, panties with wide crotch
(Palace dress set)

1076
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:19,320
(Palace dress set)

1077
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,050
Slip skirt shirt
(Palace dress set)

1078
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:22,070
(Palace dress set)

1079
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,150
Petticoat, long gown, coat skirt
(Palace dress set)

1080
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:25,180
(Palace dress set)

1081
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,240
Three-edge jacket
(Palace dress set)

1082
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:26,260
(Palace dress set)

1083
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,460
There is also Tang Yi
(Palace dress set)

1084
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,570
(Palace dress set)

1085
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,740
Tops are only underwear
(Palace dress set)

1086
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,870
Tops are only underwear

1087
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,210
The bottom is a layered multi-piece garment.

1088
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,920
This is for the etiquette of thick and thin

1089
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,140
I can't breathe anymore

1090
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,700
The tassels and pearls cover the eyes

1091
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,860
The bands that fall down from the sides cover the ears

1092
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,320
It means covering your eyes and ears.

1093
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,340
Listen to the meaning of God’s Word

1094
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,360
Please straighten your neck

1095
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,850
So heavy

1096
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,420
Need to bear this weight

1097
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,390
I am the first NO BRA in North Korea

1098
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,680
Greetings

1099
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,270
Niangniang

1100
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,500
What do you want?

1101
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,150
It's not a sacrifice.

1102
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,600
They say marriage is a funeral.

1103
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,500
Salute again.

1104
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,830
Twice more

1105
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,770
What a beautiful couple.

1106
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,610
Aren't these all the work of the Queen?

1107
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,490
Thank you for your appreciation, Queen.

1108
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:58,800
Gold Cup Ceremony

1109
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:31,290
no

1110
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,130
Are you crying now, my dear elder?

1111
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:41,140
On this day, I became the mother of the nation.

1112
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,810
But when the time comes

1113
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,380
I still feel like I lost my only daughter.

1114
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,400
Now you are not the father-in-law of the emperor.

1115
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,410
Rong En, the father-in-law

1116
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,970
Is that so?

1117
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,590
Announced here

1118
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,920
Kim So-yong of Andong Jinmen became the mother of the Joseon nation

1119
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,660
Looking at this woman's name

1120
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,600
You must like me

1121
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,530
Shortness of breath, heart palsy

1122
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,040
Back off

1123
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,940
Respectfully bow down

1124
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,470
There are no permanent enemies in the palace.

1125
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,180
There is no eternal army.

1126
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,660
You must keep your heart and empty your mind

1127
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,080
Don't worry

1128
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,530
I just want to do my best for His Highness.

1129
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,400
Auntie, I'm not going to die.

1130
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,890
Don't miss me too much

1131
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,650
Such a kind lady

1132
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,730
How can I persist in that dangerous palace?

1133
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,720
Don't worry, I'll be by your side to take care of you.

1134
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,090
Surrender Surrender Surrender

1135
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,620
I thought we would drink in the pavilion

1136
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,240
So you shouldn't say you're going on a tour.

1137
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,500
I should say training.

1138
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:17,770
Isn't it nice to sweat under the beautiful scenery?

1139
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,860
What's good

1140
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,570
Or maybe it's because he has a father who is a military minister.

1141
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,360
I am dying every day because of the martial arts training I have no talent for.

1142
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:25,880
What is this?

1143
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,360
If I knew, I would never come.

1144
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,770
Who would think that they had made enemies?

1145
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,940
It's a happy event that my cousin became the mother of the nation

1146
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,380
Why are you so angry?

1147
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,930
Great, I'm so excited, so

1148
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,240
If you don't like swordplay, just fight.

1149
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,830
I changed my mind and I want to go home

1150
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,350
Defeat me before you leave

1151
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,430
Hurry up, hurry up, the neck is broken

1152
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,070
I really thought I was going to die.

1153
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,310
Photographing dress makeup is really nothing

1154
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,790
But it was upgraded at night.

1155
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,650
This is the Great Foundry

1156
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,010
As big as the name

1157
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,140
It means to make great contributions

1158
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,940
Is it to save the country or something?

1159
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,570
It means to make the prince pregnant

1160
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,670
Oh, and I have a roommate.

1161
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,480
This is the biggest crisis in Zhang Fenghuan's 33 years of life

1162
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:18,880
There is always a way to escape.

1163
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,220
The wine table has arrived

1164
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,530
Oh, wine.

1165
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,810
My ancestors, I want to drink

1166
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,630
I'll pour you a cup

1167
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,860
What kind of wine does His Majesty like?

1168
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,090
I prefer snacks to wine.

1169
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,020
Such days

1170
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,810
Don't talk about snacks.

1171
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,680
Excessive drinking is harmful to the body

1172
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,580
Don't get excited, calm down.

1173
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:30,290
There is no

1174
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:31,840
A person without alcohol

1175
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:38,050
You can't drink alcohol. You can't drink as much as I can.

1176
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,980
It just so happens that the wine here belongs to the queen.

1177
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,480
Is this guy wearing a bulletproof vest or something?

1178
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,860
Nothing works.

1179
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,110
Do you want to play a drinking game?

1180
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,260
I know a few drinking games.

1181
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,080
Yeah

1182
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:59,710
three six nine three six nine three six nine three six nine

1183
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,590
When did the multiplication table first appear?

1184
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,480
Don't you know?

1185
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,280
Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book

1186
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,800
Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book

1187
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,220
The word guilt

1188
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,960
It's for use at this time.

1189
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,090
Why don't you do it?

1190
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,890
How can I say it's a game? I'm looking forward to it

1191
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:24,510
I know it's not good to call it a sign-in book.

1192
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,510
Harsh guy

1193
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,010
Drinking or singing and dancing, right?

1194
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,170
When should the music for the ancestral temple ceremony end?

1195
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,070
See, aren't my shoulders shaking?

1196
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,950
The wine went in...

1197
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,110
Keep going in...

1198
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,470
So interesting?

1199
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:55,810
What? Is the music for the ancestral temple ritual effective?

1200
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,760
So let's start

1201
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,230
No, no, it's not the official start

1202
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,830
I have to use the last resort.

1203
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:54,520
(Preview of the next episode)

1204
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,300
How does it feel to be welcoming your first day as queen?

1205
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,020
That's it.

1206
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,450
We are preparing for a struggle for rights and status

1207
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,380
The only way we can punish the powerful

1208
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,120
It's the documents that prove their corruption.

1209
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:27,330
It seems that the Queen's condition is indeed abnormal.

1210
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,460
For us, who is more important than

1211
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,990
Who must be more important?

1212
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,290
It's a gift

1213
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,260
If there is such a good method, use it now.

1214
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:37,120
What is the final method?

1215
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:37,980
Assassination
