1
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,820
(This drama is purely fictional characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,930
I said why are you standing here

3
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,730
It's here

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,140
I won't have no touch today

5
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,110
Niangniang

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,420
How are you

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,150
Oops, which guy is this?

8
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,060
Let's go

9
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,100
Let's go.

10
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,080
(Episode 9)

11
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,870
To allow them to have a good rest

12
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,420
Arrange in different rooms

13
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,670
I didn't think carefully enough.

14
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,720
I heard something breaking in the main room.

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,690
I woke up because of that sound.

16
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,850
I saw that the doors and windows were also torn

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Very suspicious. Watch carefully.

18
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,380
but

19
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,660
Might disturb them both.

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,480
Everything in the house is broken.

21
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,884
I don't think it's strange anymore

22
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,654
The bloodiness of a newlywed

23
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:20,474
Do we need to protect their private lives?

24
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,424
Stay away from the main house.

25
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,620
yes

26
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,290
I'd better go to the side room.

27
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,030
You keep watch.

28
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,310
OK

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
Please

30
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,940
Enough is enough, woman.

31
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,190
Damn, I got into trouble after all.

32
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,190
You want to fight me, right?

33
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,400
Who are you fighting with now?

34
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,160
You go away

35
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,890
This is Kim So-yong and me

36
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,340
Two people's affairs

37
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,860
As long as I'm here

38
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,740
This body is under my control

39
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,250
I am the master of this body

40
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,920
Still very drunk.

41
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,200
Can't tell the difference between dreams and reality

42
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,600
It's a blessing

43
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,540
What's the meaning

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,460
Even if I'm drunk, I have to go home

45
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,430
No, this is not a dream.

46
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,860
You can't be in my dream

47
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,660
I appeared in the dream of the nave

48
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,280
Feel sorry

49
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,340
Forget the nightmare

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,640
(Episode 9 Light and Darkness)

51
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,440
Itchy Hong Yan

52
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,690
No

53
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,970
If it weren't for this place,

54
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,200
What's wrong

55
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,890
Don't panic about the past.

56
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Hello

57
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,420
What's wrong

58
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,190
Told us not to go near the main house

59
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,770
What's wrong

60
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,820
have no idea

61
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Come and sit

62
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,090
actually

63
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,940
I'm really worried about our Queen

64
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,150
Didn't you hear anything?

65
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,230
The Queen Mother

66
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,260
Suddenly woke up

67
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,320
Running around

68
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,190
Hey you man

69
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,510
Don't talk nonsense

70
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,120
I've worked here all my life.

71
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,150
I've never seen our young lady running around.

72
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,040
I'm telling the truth

73
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,180
You

74
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,340
Always feel suspicious

75
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,370
No

76
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,810
What is not

77
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,140
oops

78
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,960
A person wearing the clothes of the Ijinfu

79
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,930
If that's the case

80
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,810
Someone's going to die.

81
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,990
Stop drinking

82
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,680
Thirsty

83
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,700
The more I say no, the more hungry I get.

84
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,110
I'm dying of thirst.

85
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,750
If you are thirsty, you should drink water. How can you drink alcohol?

86
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,370
Someone bring water.

87
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,770
yes

88
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,510
The more you drink, the thirstier you feel.

89
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,760
Oops!

90
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,340
It's like being knocked unconscious.

91
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,500
Sleeping very deeply

92
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
oops

93
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,270
That's right

94
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,810
Feeling very comfortable

95
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,760
you

96
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,880
you

97
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,400
you

98
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,090
you

99
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,970
I don't know if it's because the site was chosen well.

100
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,610
I slept so comfortably.

101
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,070
Is this such a natural thing?

102
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,970
There's nothing weird about it.

103
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,560
Because I don't care about the same room day or something

104
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,250
Sharing a room in a private home feels more natural

105
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,470
Too

106
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,410
Maybe he needs to pretend to be in the same room with me.

107
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,620
Your acting is really good today.

108
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,900
good

109
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,140
We had a hot night.

110
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,920
I don't know how hot and lively it is.

111
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,960
What

112
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,230
Remember this time

113
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,030
If you don't remember it like our first night

114
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,710
I will still be sad

115
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,430
Is this a side effect of restoring memory?

116
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,080
I sleep like a baby.

117
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,730
You can't mess around here like this.

118
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,270
I must become Chunyuan's sister as soon as possible

119
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,010
Irreplaceable existence

120
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,650
Even if it causes bloodshed in the Han family

121
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,570
Can't find me

122
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,440
The person wearing the mask is clearly

123
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,230
Have the same goal as me

124
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,230
What does Kim Byung-in know?

125
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,980
The account books must not fall into their hands.

126
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,790
today

127
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,100
You must return to the palace

128
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,660
today

129
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,330
Must find the account book

130
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,400
You'll harm your body.

131
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
When will the Queen return to the palace?

132
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,620
I sent someone to ask His Highness and the Queen Mother to return to the palace as soon as possible.

133
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,110
Life in the palace is never boring.

134
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,540
I haven't seen the central hall for a few days and I feel very empty

135
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,900
The Craftsmanship of the Queen Mother

136
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,630
Is it that good?

137
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,360
It's more humane than flavor

138
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,130
Favors

139
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,780
Human feelings are precious.

140
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,390
I was hungry this morning.

141
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,550
No

142
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,050
I miss the Central Palace.

143
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
Oh, how pitiful

144
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,910
That's why habits are terrible.

145
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,540
She thinks I'm taking advantage of her.

146
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,780
Sometimes I feel

147
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,500
It's actually me who is being spoiled.

148
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,410
So you have to be prepared for other things.

149
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,110
I asked the Imperial Kitchen to learn the cooking skills of the Queen Mother

150
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,760
My brother arranged such a perfect palace life for me

151
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,220
Do I have a reason to leave the palace?

152
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,990
That's why I'm in this position.

153
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,070
To protect the perfect world of the queen

154
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,440
That's right

155
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,820
You can ask Bingren to come here to pay his respects occasionally.

156
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,360
What's up?

157
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,580
He is your adopted son.

158
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,610
I don't love him enough.

159
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,820
It's okay to let him do small things occasionally.

160
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,960
Now my brother is also old

161
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Just do the important things.

162
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,410
My sister's affairs are to me

163
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
Everything is important

164
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,750
What are you doing?

165
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,830
Now the uprising is confirmed by the forbidden government

166
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,580
The identities of all members of the Guard

167
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,020
The Royal Guards are the ones that His Highness has been most recently with.

168
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,360
The one who assists His Highness

169
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,230
Identity confirmation is necessary

170
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,170
Don't let them take another step forward.

171
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,400
They have already adopted clear methods

172
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,140
Identified

173
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,970
Now even family trees can be bought and sold for money

174
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,400
Who knows?

175
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,690
Is there anyone with a fake identity in the team who is plotting rebellion?

176
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,510
Please cooperate with the work of the Yijinfu

177
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,570
If you can't find

178
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,300
Evidence to prove what I just said

179
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,390
Then I will also fulfill my responsibilities as the captain of the guard.

180
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,210
You still have to sit in that seat.

181
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,070
Unless you are also involved in this matter

182
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,640
Otherwise you'd better get out of the way

183
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,800
search

184
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,170
Yes Yes

185
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,100
Search carefully for me.

186
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,090
Don’t miss a single file

187
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,810
All moved to the Imperial Palace

188
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,070
Yes Yes

189
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,530
Did you sleep well last night?

190
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,120
I just got a beautiful bird.

191
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,360
What do you think?

192
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,260
You really understand sentiment.

193
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,200
I received this as a souvenir.

194
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,140
A precious bird

195
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,620
Did something good happen to you?

196
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,710
The ill-fated relationship between Yipin and Zhongdian

197
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,640
It's harder to let go than I thought.

198
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,990
There's something I haven't told you.

199
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,560
Haven't told anyone.

200
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,020
A secret that only the Queen and I know

201
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,220
The Queen Mother thought it was me

202
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,630
He stole his Lord

203
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,610
Because of what happened eight years ago

204
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,640
Our arrows are now laced with poison

205
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,190
Now, let's use the second weapon.

206
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,190
yes

207
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,090
It’s just not easy to find something similar

208
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,950
So you have to spend some time

209
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,170
But even if it is done

210
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,420
I will definitely prepare everything for you.

211
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,030
Plug it in.

212
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,470
The identity of the guards will be exposed sooner or later.

213
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,350
Let's find a way.

214
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,650
The soldier from the Imperial Guard that Your Highness ran into last night

215
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Didn't I see your royal face?

216
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,500
He doesn't seem to know me

217
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,500
If he sees me later

218
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,050
He will know what I am doing with my account book.

219
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,350
But that soldier

220
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,330
He was wearing a mask at the time

221
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,210
Ghost Mask

222
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,860
What

223
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,960
Is there any damage on his mask?

224
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,430
have

225
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,080
And it seems like it's been a long time.

226
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,310
That's the person who killed May before.

227
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,680
So Kim Jakeun is indeed

228
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,260
By Kim Byeong-in

229
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,440
Fortunately,

230
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,380
The other party didn't know that the account book had been swapped.

231
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,120
Tonight is the last chance

232
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,390
Your Highness

233
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,310
There is a letter from you in the palace

234
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,020
This is a letter from General Kim Jageun.

235
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,580
As a result, the deputy general of the Yijinfu came in person.

236
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,070
This should have been the business of the chief of the Yijinfu's minions.

237
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,640
You came here in person.

238
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,190
Are you so idle?

239
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,400
Letters are too important.

240
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,020
I will personally deliver it

241
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,780
Please bring the Queen back to the palace immediately.

242
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,330
A mere training general

243
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,230
Can you still order me to return to the palace?

244
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,830
This is the message conveyed by the Queen Mother.

245
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,890
For the safety of the nave

246
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,610
I plan to stay one more night

247
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,290
You go back and tell her

248
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:41,840
But

249
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,110
My mind is made up

250
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,900
Go back quickly and don't disturb the nave's recuperation.

251
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Really

252
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,390
Your Highness is like this

253
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,180
For the health of the Queen Mother

254
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,960
I will convey the truth

255
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,750
I will have my breakfast with her in the room in the nave

256
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,410
Please prepare something light as usual.

257
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,520
Yes, yes, yes

258
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,710
Same as usual

259
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,510
yes

260
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,190
Yipin's family is nearby.

261
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,030
I'll go check out May

262
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,360
You are considering

263
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,380
Sending Yipin away like yesterday

264
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,580
I feel guilty too.

265
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,830
After all, I returned to the palace one day late

266
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,790
Brother, please take care of Concubine Yi for me.

267
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,020
yes

268
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
recent

269
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,540
The empress who had always been there is suddenly gone.

270
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,060
The imperial kitchen is so empty

271
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,860
I can finally breathe.

272
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,350
Hey you kid

273
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,630
Add more oil and put

274
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,560
Brat

275
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,480
Cut it finely

276
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
Why are you grinding so slowly?

277
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,810
How happy this is

278
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,210
How peaceful this is.

279
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,980
I am more suitable for a big house.

280
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:41,110
Waiting for experienced people Waiting for experienced people Waiting for experienced people

281
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,670
Ouch ouch

282
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,110
Waiting for experienced people Waiting for experienced people Waiting for experienced people

283
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,390
Okay, okay.

284
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,320
Go back

285
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey Choi Sang-Gong

286
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,610
Not Choi Sang-Gong Choi Sang-Gong

287
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,140
no

288
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,550
Look at your expression

289
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,980
Is the Queen Mother still not fully recovered?

290
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,280
No

291
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,910
Fortunately, she has recovered.

292
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,330
Why do you look so gloomy?

293
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,030
In recent times

294
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,170
My wife always makes me worry

295
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,610
I thought I couldn't see her anymore.

296
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,970
No need to nag

297
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,410
I will feel more comfortable.

298
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,140
result

299
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going crazy.

300
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,190
How crazy will she be when I'm not around?

301
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm really worried

302
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,630
Oh, originally

303
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,240
Compared to obedient children

304
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,740
Children who worry about others are more worrying

305
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,700
Stop frowning all the time.

306
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,020
Give it

307
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,020
Open it. Open it and see.

308
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,100
Picked up on the road

309
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,040
Recently I always feel

310
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,360
It seems to be mine but it is not mine. It seems to be mine.

311
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,980
Recently I always feel

312
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,680
It seems to be mine but it is not mine. It seems to be mine.

313
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,310
Recently I always feel

314
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,020
Seems like mine

315
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,550
What do you do with the garbage you pick up on the road?

316
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,400
Recently I always feel

317
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,430
What a weird man.

318
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,120
Can't you throw it away yourself? Why do you give it to me?

319
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,820
Really

320
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,890
perhaps

321
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,320
No news in May?

322
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,750
Could it be

323
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,020
What happened in May?

324
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,920
She hasn't returned home yet.

325
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,710
I guess she felt guilty about you and went somewhere else.

326
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,110
I'm looking for you, don't worry.

327
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,790
I told her that.

328
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,340
I'm looking for the sachet you gave her earlier.

329
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Even if it's to go somewhere else

330
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,230
She will definitely sell it.

331
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,550
I'm so scared

332
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,110
Afraid of losing everyone

333
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,350
When will His Majesty return to the palace?

334
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,560
He also wants

335
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,940
I'll be back in one more day.

336
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,690
It's not what you think.

337
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,920
Although I can't tell you in detail

338
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,170
But as long as tonight passes

339
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,230
It's all over.

340
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,070
My Lord, maybe now

341
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,680
It's not that I don't have the energy to think about other things.

342
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,700
Maybe you've changed your mind about me?

343
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,970
Am I the only one?

344
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,810
Holding on to the childhood bond

345
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,290
I can't help but think of when I returned to Hanyang two years ago

346
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,990
When I accompanied His Highness to see you

347
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,430
Even though it was the first time His Highness saw you

348
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,230
He will also

349
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,980
Fall in love with you

350
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,420
Listen to you say this

351
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,200
I have some courage

352
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,330
Same as usual

353
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,330
It's me who needs treatment

354
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,000
Why do you want to stay another night?

355
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,760
I just want to take care of your body

356
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,070
That's the decision

357
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,340
Medical treatment should be entrusted to doctors, and medicine should be entrusted to pharmacists

358
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,480
You are a king, don't you take care of state affairs?

359
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,880
What to do to take care of my health

360
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,910
Don't you know how hard the people are working now?

361
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,750
Yes, what the palace said is very true

362
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,630
Right?

363
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,540
Then you drank this bowl of turtle soup

364
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,180
Go back and be your king.

365
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,730
Don't let its sacrifice go to waste

366
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,170
Compared to the sacrifice of the turtle

367
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,310
I'm going to visit incognito today

368
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,720
Go and see the hard life of the people

369
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,600
It's getting late

370
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
I have to stay one more night.

371
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,310
You don't want to stay in the palace, do you?

372
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,390
It's even more unbearable than my wife's family.

373
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,080
Yes, I also like a comfortable wife's home.

374
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,560
What kind of person is the Queen Mother?

375
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,160
She is the elder sister of Master Jin Zuogen

376
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,570
After entering the palace, he never left the palace.

377
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,180
Then as long as I bring the delicacies outside the palace

378
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,930
If you bring it to Chun Yuan sister to taste

379
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,850
That

380
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,330
I saw that in historical dramas, there was always soup and rice during the drinking scene.

381
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,530
What does it taste like?

382
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,940
How would I know what such cheap food tastes like?

383
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,270
The taste is not good

384
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,900
The scary thing is the taste I know.

385
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,960
Sheep head soup

386
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,310
Use soybean paste to adjust the saltiness

387
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,880
Although the meat is rich and fragrant, it is still very bitter

388
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
But it's also charming

389
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,530
Side dish: radish kimchi without shrimp paste

390
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,660
Very suitable for eating with soup and rice

391
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,030
No wonder the king eats it every time he goes out on a private visit.

392
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,360
Oh, damn it.

393
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,370
The neighbor who was supposed to pay the tax ran away.

394
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,590
Now you want me to help pay the taxes

395
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,170
Those bandits are really

396
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,020
Be careful when speaking

397
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,080
Do you want to be beaten to death?

398
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,180
Anyway, I'm either biting my tongue and committing suicide

399
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,740
Or run away and become a thief

400
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,300
What should I pay attention to?

401
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,290
I have nothing to lose

402
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,030
The country has become like this

403
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,120
It's not what the king is doing.

404
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,290
What else can you do?

405
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,240
Of course, we also embezzled it together

406
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,570
This kind of thing should be turned a blind eye

407
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,670
They also do it to make things easier for themselves.

408
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,160
Put him on the throne.

409
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,270
He's just a puppet.

410
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,600
Really

411
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,610
Hello, Hello, Hello

412
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,920
I listen and listen

413
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,770
It's really hard.

414
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,060
The people actually

415
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,190
The useless kings died one by one

416
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Let me have a drink to calm you down.

417
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,360
I think your status should be not low.

418
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,570
Just two shifts

419
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,300
This damn family tree is too expensive

420
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,580
I have nothing but this and my family tree.

421
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,590
Nothing

422
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,990
Really

423
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,970
No, I've also heard that among young people recently

424
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,370
There are indeed many such people.

425
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,190
Really

426
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,000
The country is just a facade

427
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,180
What good is it no matter how capable the people are?

428
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,390
interesting

429
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,390
interesting

430
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,720
Oh, this guy is really

431
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,490
This fake two-shift is really interesting

432
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,760
It's very interesting

433
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,020
But they actually let a

434
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,660
A member of the traitor family becomes king

435
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,750
Can the heart not rot?

436
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,920
He is a grandfather, a father, and a brother.

437
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,210
Let a man whose descendants are all traitors be king

438
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,180
Is this reasonable?

439
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,580
It's funny that he becomes the king just because he is asked to do so.

440
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,180
Isn't this parasitic?

441
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,280
The Kim family that destroyed their own family?

442
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,020
There's really no spirit at all.

443
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,240
Damn

444
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,740
No more

445
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,800
You guys are going too far.

446
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,200
It is your freedom to scold anyone you want.

447
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,900
But it's not good to scold your family members

448
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,320
There is a limit to bad reviews.

449
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,210
Do you think it's easy to be a king?

450
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,090
If you're not careful, you'll get poisoned in the head.

451
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,570
That position is difficult to hold.

452
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,090
Are you from the palace?

453
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,620
The king's advocate?

454
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,220
Who are you?

455
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,210
I

456
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,620
I am

457
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,030
King's Fan Club

458
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,330
What

459
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,080
Fan Club

460
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,230
Black fans are also fans

461
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
In conclusion

462
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,160
Try scolding your family again.

463
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,570
I will definitely take care of you then.

464
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,270
Wait, wait, do you know?

465
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,460
Sorry, sorry.

466
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,180
wine mother

467
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,740
Checkout

468
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,300
no

469
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,480
Come here

470
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,280
Really

471
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,510
Oh, it's really

472
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,230
You have such a bad temper.

473
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,090
Let go, let go, let go

474
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,990
I don't really want to fight.

475
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,780
Didn't you say it was a private interview?

476
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,010
Your identity cannot be revealed

477
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,430
I'll be mad at you.

478
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,210
What happened? What happened?

479
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,950
Your acting is so good

480
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,130
Do you know what this means?

481
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,350
Isn't that a compliment?

482
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,640
But what does a fan club mean?

483
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,650
Simply wishing someone happiness and success

484
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,230
A noble existence

485
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,880
It turns out to be similar to faith.

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,260
What about the haters?

487
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,810
Um

488
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,760
More caring people than a fan club

489
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,790
Stronger Faith

490
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,590
Too luxurious

491
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,860
Your feelings for me

492
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,240
no

493
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,700
If it's not the middle hall

494
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,090
I might sell soup rice in the future.

495
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,040
Don't say that

496
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,720
I won't let you be deposed.

497
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,790
I am also your hater

498
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,010
Okay

499
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,950
Then I'll be relieved.

500
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,830
Well, let's go our separate ways.

501
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,390
Anyway, you and I have different destinations.

502
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,190
Are there any gourmet restaurants where everyone lines up?

503
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,530
Peaceful An Ti

504
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,460
Fan

505
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,640
I have always been confident in my Chinese.

506
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,940
As expected, there is no end to learning.

507
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,030
Looks really delicious

508
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,060
Scare me

509
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,190
What's wrong

510
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,320
You appear here dressed so elegantly

511
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,780
Very easy to become a target

512
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,580
What target

513
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,690
Alas, how could such a noble person come here?

514
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,340
Such a target

515
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,500
Get out of the way

516
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,290
I don't want to hurt you

517
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,700
Do you like her?

518
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,660
Alas, it's all in vain.

519
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,380
I suggest you throw that thing away

520
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,810
Poor soul, I am the only one who has the idea of comfort

521
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,320
Although I have always felt

522
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,280
Our eldest brother may have learned to read.

523
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,150
The words and metaphors used are very advanced.

524
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,610
Don't be so cheap.

525
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,270
yes

526
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,620
Don't worry

527
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
I will protect you

528
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,600
I'm a fan of the Central Palace.

529
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,800
What did he just say?

530
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,680
I was scared to death

531
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,270
Regardless of era and country

532
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,950
Those dark places really can't be entered

533
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,100
I'll leave my affairs to you, Zhezong

534
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,570
But if Cheoljong made a mistake

535
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,830
History won't change.

536
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,310
I'm a special forces soldier.

537
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,930
Already dead?

538
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,610
Cheoljong

539
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,820
Dead dead?

540
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,060
I don't know the way home

541
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,840
How could the distinguished guest

542
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,220
I thought he came here because he was worried about me.

543
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,060
Are you coming back now because you don't know how to go home?

544
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,970
Where have all the dark guys gone?

545
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,520
Go after the one wearing the more expensive robe

546
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,020
Don't worry

547
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,840
I'll protect you

548
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,450
I'm a fan of the Central Palace

549
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,830
What are you saying?

550
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,970
The current situation is not one where you can easily show your back.

551
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,070
That kind of peaceful situation

552
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,420
Such a lack of crisis awareness

553
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,560
It's a poem.

554
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,740
Is this from the Qing Dynasty?

555
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,160
Looks good.

556
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,780
If I sell this, I'll be able to eat well for several days.

557
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,730
Take it off.

558
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,430
How can you easily expose the back of your head?

559
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,590
I didn't kill him

560
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,740
I just plan to kill the next one.

561
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,550
So

562
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,640
Why is this person here?

563
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,330
Drunk

564
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,390
Anyway, you're lucky

565
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,730
But why are the clothes like this?

566
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,470
I thought about it

567
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,460
Wearing Yangban's clothes to visit incognito

568
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,230
There seems to be a limit

569
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,140
What are you doing

570
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,230
I looked and saw something to buy

571
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,260
I was in a hurry to go out and didn't bring any money with me

572
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,930
OK

573
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,680
Actually stole the thief's things

574
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,120
let me see

575
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,840
It would be unethical to take everything.

576
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,760
Let's have a bowl of soup.

577
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,100
for you

578
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,130
Let's go

579
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,070
What are you going to buy?

580
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,950
so

581
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,430
The other party is a martial arts expert

582
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,830
That man is alert.

583
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,360
I will definitely find it

584
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,180
If I see that face again, can I remember it?

585
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,200
certainly

586
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,290
grown ups

587
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,300
What about medicine?

588
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,050
I clearly said that.

589
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,710
If you fail, there is no medicine.

590
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,550
How are you going to repay

591
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,260
Want to offer your hand?

592
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,160
I will definitely redeem it

593
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,410
Betting my life

594
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,820
What is this?

595
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,700
This is a jar made during the Goryeo period.

596
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,010
Really

597
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,760
This precious thing

598
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,750
How much

599
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,890
It's fake

600
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,370
If you want to use it for self-defense, buy it.

601
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,630
It's a lie

602
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,090
Please choose

603
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,580
All-in

604
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,640
Madam, it is not okay to gamble too much.

605
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,940
Spending money to make money is pure capitalism

606
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,720
All-in

607
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,550
sorry

608
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,440
What to do

609
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,450
Madam Madam

610
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,230
Open and see. Open and see.

611
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,270
The kind of liar who opens a bet

612
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,220
There are obviously accomplices around.

613
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,330
possible

614
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,350
Most of the people watching are collaborators.

615
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,760
A king from birth

616
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,690
From now on, I have a good understanding of the ecology of the lower layer.

617
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,080
She had denied it before.

618
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,110
Because that's my weakness.

619
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,060
My family was dragged into rebellion

620
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,160
Ganghwa Island Order

621
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,580
All of that is biting at my weakness

622
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,830
Do you have nightmares every night about being torn apart by ministers?

623
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,940
A true nightmare

624
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,340
This shouldn't be a dream after falling asleep.

625
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,620
A truly terrible nightmare

626
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,230
Why did you stop talking halfway?

627
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,040
Forgot what I was going to say

628
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,910
actually

629
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,940
There is something I have always been curious about the Middle Temple.

630
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,220
Why did you hide what happened that day?

631
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,510
What's up

632
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,300
I almost killed the middle temple.

633
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,030
that

634
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,770
Because I don't want to get involved

635
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,210
I just want to try my best

636
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,550
Passing by all the storms

637
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,630
Only when peace and prosperity come as soon as possible

638
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,270
So that you can be lazy as much as you want.

639
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,280
Saving the country is not for me.

640
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,900
We should have stood up to greet our Yongping Jun.

641
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,110
Because I was sleeping on the cold floor

642
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,210
I have body aches

643
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,140
If I sleep one more night, my handsome mouth will be crooked

644
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,330
Are you done?

645
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,360
What

646
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,980
Mumbling

647
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,970
Also includes a little show off

648
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,600
Although there are still the second and third sections

649
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,290
But it seems like there's something important to do, so let's stop here.

650
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,940
All right

651
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,690
What's up

652
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,420
I heard here

653
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,190
Mask making is awesome

654
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,080
Pick one there.

655
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,850
This tooth

656
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,020
Don't do this common

657
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,770
I want something a little bit special

658
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,010
Special?

659
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,720
Especially recently

660
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,650
It feels like mine but not mine.

661
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,460
Light a fire

662
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,170
Burning Fire

663
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,530
yes

664
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,050
Waiting for experienced people

665
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,500
The King and the Concubine

666
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,130
To eat dinner

667
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,660
this

668
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,950
I don't know if an experienced person can make it.

669
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,660
You

670
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,030
I spent 30 years in the imperial kitchen alone.

671
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,470
I have been a skilled waiter for 12 years.

672
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,870
Maybe she's not as good as the Queen Mother?

673
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,820
I only believe in you

674
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,800
Damn it again

675
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,310
Start Over

676
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,290
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

677
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,660
hurry up

678
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,440
What's going on?

679
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,480
The milk of the cows in the capital

680
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,930
All squeezed out

681
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,860
Go again

682
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,840
There is no more crowding

683
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,750
What

684
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,870
Brat

685
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,920
Niangniang

686
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,860
hateful

687
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,030
Suddenly I feel irritable and unhappy

688
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,390
This messed up body

689
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,820
The body lying there like a corpse

690
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,210
None of them look like me

691
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,090
Now

692
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,210
My name is Zhang Zhaorong

693
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,540
Even Kim Bong-hwan can't figure it out

694
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,080
Because memory is lost and regained

695
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,530
I feel confused.

696
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,040
You know what's really annoying?

697
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm slowly getting used to this body.

698
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,120
I feel comfortable wearing skirts now.

699
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,990
The day has come

700
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,490
I'll prepare the sanitary belt right away.

701
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,900
(Sanitary belt- sanitary napkin)
I'll prepare the sanitary belt right away.

702
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,870
(Sanitary belt- sanitary napkin)

703
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,470
I

704
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,400
I'm having my period.

705
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,220
Quan Shang Gong

706
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,570
It's the queen

707
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,690
Why hasn't the Queen Mother entered the palace yet?

708
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,490
I'll issue the decree right away.

709
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,420
There's no war going on. Why is there so much noise?

710
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,470
I will issue a greeting order tomorrow.

711
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,140
It's the queen

712
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,900
Why is our wife not the same as before?

713
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,030
The desire for food is a sin, a sin.

714
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,420
Very hungry

715
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,710
One side left

716
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,070
No one is here

717
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,330
It's me

718
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,710
Come in

719
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,590
I'm waiting for you to come

720
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,520
How did you know I just came back?

721
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,720
How could this complexion become so bad?

722
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,560
Friend

723
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,120
Were you robbed by a thief on the road?

724
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,040
Or is the written document finished?

725
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,540
no

726
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,950
These are all accidents that happened in the past.

727
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,980
It's a more serious problem.

728
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,760
Could it be some other document?

729
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,250
This is all on the way to find Chengwenshu.

730
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,650
Your family background is not enough to care about me.

731
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,540
It's the door

732
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,360
Still Love

733
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,790
This is a problem.

734
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,280
Oh my!

735
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,390
Oh my!

736
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,180
This is a really big deal.

737
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,070
Niangniang

738
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,740
The Queen Mother issued a call

739
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,340
Did you call me?

740
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,170
The Queen Mother thought that the death of the late king

741
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,330
I don't have any responsibility at all.

742
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,390
That's why I blame you so much.

743
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,840
We are from the Jin family.

744
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,180
Niangniang

745
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,360
No matter how you insult me,

746
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,210
But please protect the late king.

747
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,150
You are using your son as a shield again.

748
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,340
It's really annoying

749
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,240
I'm blaming others again

750
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,910
To hide your guilt

751
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,110
People need to understand themselves

752
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,840
So as not to make the same mistakes again and again

753
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,290
Your teachings

754
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,310
I accepted it with gratitude.

755
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,630
I'm really miserable.

756
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,320
I can't even take off my shoes and socks.

757
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,790
This matter

758
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,720
I'll do it for you

759
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,350
The training day is coming soon.

760
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,080
Until then, I'll leave my service to you.

761
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,640
I'm back

762
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,440
good

763
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,130
I'm very busy at work today.

764
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,460
I heard you were looking for King Jin Yi.

765
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,650
Because there are many doubts

766
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,950
So I tried to look for signs.

767
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,680
There are many suspicious points about King Jinyi's identity.

768
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,870
To be precise, this is only part of it.

769
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,370
Did you already know this?

770
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,950
Do you think I don't know?

771
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,730
Is that why you just sit there motionless?

772
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,940
Such exciting action

773
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,280
What do you think will happen to those people?

774
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,930
It will definitely be hidden deeper.

775
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,040
More hidden and less conspicuous

776
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,610
What I can see poses no threat.

777
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,310
Understand the other person's thoughts

778
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,020
Give the other party the illusion that you have hidden yourself well.

779
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,590
Wait until a problem occurs

780
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,740
Can you immediately have the determination to cut off your tail and survive?

781
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,350
I'm short-sighted.

782
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,510
You think I'm just innocent because

783
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,990
Your Majesty is not good enough as a king.

784
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,450
And helped him get to that position?

785
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,010
I planted the seeds of fear in him.

786
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,880
Those who understand fear are easy to deal with

787
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,590
Those in high positions fear my words

788
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,460
Then my strength is to surpass that height

789
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,540
Things related to the Lord in the future

790
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,570
I will follow my father's instructions.

791
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,050
Go in and take a rest

792
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,600
It won't be discovered here.

793
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,420
Mom will definitely come to pick you up

794
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,790
Before that

795
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,930
You absolutely can't come out

796
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,460
But brothers, what about you, mother?

797
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,010
I just want you to be alive

798
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,760
You are my only real son.

799
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:05,950
If you die

800
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,480
I'll die anyway.

801
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,950
Hurry

802
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,310
Hurry

803
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,600
This is an illusion

804
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,860
This is not true

805
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,270
Find it quickly

806
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,660
Did I see it wrong?

807
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,580
How is it possible?

808
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,220
The Queen Mother gave my face

809
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,520
My life and family are ruined.

810
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,580
Niangniang

811
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,300
Niangniang

812
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,550
I promised to come back

813
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,300
MILF

814
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,380
My lady, you said you would come back.

815
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,340
sorry

816
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,880
It's all lies

817
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,420
It must be like this in my heart

818
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,340
No

819
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,080
It's not a curse.

820
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,000
Jin Zhaoyong

821
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,640
What?

822
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,700
Make it seem

823
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,560
Do you think you can become Kim So-yong this way?

824
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,320
There is still one that is the same.

825
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,780
No mother's this

826
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,560
Father and son

827
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,450
The relationship between ruler and subject

828
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,850
Respect for elders

829
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,140
A letter from a friend

830
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,260
I have memorized the book by heart.

831
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,480
Why are you still not satisfied?

832
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,420
Because today is my mother's death anniversary.

833
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,950
This is the book my mother wrote.

834
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,310
You'll do this when you miss your mom.

835
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,630
I cry every day

836
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,910
This goes on

837
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,510
There is a way to see my mother.

838
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,020
What is

839
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,550
After I die, I can see my mother.

840
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,410
Still alive

841
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,470
Are you here to die too?

842
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,180
What do you mean?

843
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,640
I'm here to die.

844
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,630
Do you want to live?

845
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,820
Because you're afraid of death?

846
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,330
no

847
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,290
If everyone died

848
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,570
I'm the only one left alive

849
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,390
This is even more terrifying

850
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,630
So

851
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,690
Let's do it together

852
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,410
Do it on the count of three.

853
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,070
Um

854
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,670
There is a sound here

855
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,180
Cousin?

856
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,390
Do you know how worried everyone is about you?

857
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,110
I've gone through so much trouble to find you.

858
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,400
Cousin

859
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,020
I'll be down now

860
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,080
Just put a ladder down.

861
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:31,540
knew

862
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,570
sorry

863
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,700
I still want to live

864
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,910
You actually want to live, right?

865
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,560
I will come back

866
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,260
If you want to live, if you want to live

867
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,960
Come up and give me this

868
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,370
Is it over?

869
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,280
Um

870
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,470
Father, please

871
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,400
Miss

872
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,340
Father, father, please, please, father

873
01:01:54,420 --> 01:02:01,120
Father, father, please, father

874
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,740
Put the stone on it.

875
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,910
Father can't be father

876
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,740
Father can't be father

877
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,520
Father can't

878
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:19,760
Father can't father father

879
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,510
Father can't ask father

880
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,960
No, dad, please.

881
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,360
The mother is also the child.

882
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,360
I don't believe it at all.

883
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:47,690
Want me to beg for mercy before this well is filled

884
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,040
Absolutely impossible

885
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:23,890
Help! Help! Help!

886
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,200
Help, help, please help

887
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,670
It's because I killed it.

888
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,970
Because I didn't keep the secret

889
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,770
Because I told my nanny

890
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,800
Didn't the adults say

891
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,630
The son of a traitor

892
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,440
He did nothing wrong

893
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,570
Isn't my brother a good person? Please

894
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,380
elder brother

895
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,740
Come quickly

896
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,640
My brother is indeed a good man.

897
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:33,190
Help! Help! Help!

898
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,800
Go fast

899
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:58,120
Really came as promised

900
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,690
I want to live too

901
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:26,220
People are afraid of darkness so they want to use light to drive it away.

902
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,790
But the stronger the light, the darker the darkness

903
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,540
Flowers are real Flowers are real

904
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:38,410
(Preview of the next episode)

905
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,180
What happened

906
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,790
I almost touched it.

907
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,350
Too dangerous

908
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:02,220
Come in whenever you want.

909
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,390
When you go out, you can't just go out casually.

910
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,480
Handled

911
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,150
Do you mean a fake identity?

912
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,180
Use the Japanese pirates to drive out the Japanese pirates

913
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,380
This makes it irreplaceable.

914
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,600
K-food plus K-beauty

915
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,110
Confusion and fear paralyze rationality

916
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,380
The princess is my hater

917
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:21,770
I was worried, but I found a solution.
