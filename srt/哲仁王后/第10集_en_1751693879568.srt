00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,670
(This drama is purely fictional characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Hua Zhen

3
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,590
Hua Zhen

4
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,230
What are you doing there?

5
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,960
I'll go call someone

6
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,810
no

7
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,960
Can't let anyone know

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,790
I'm here

9
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,070
Anyone Anyone

10
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,970
oops

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,270
(Episode 10)

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,240
Any good memories there?

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,650
How did you go there?

14
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,990
Do you really not need to call someone over?

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,400
This won't really cause any deaths, right?

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,210
Are you having nightmares again?

17
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,910
Hey, wake up.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,500
Huahuazhen

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
yes

20
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,660
Whatever you think

21
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,572
This won't work. I'll go call someone.

22
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:43,742
oops

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,232
You are here again

24
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,052
Had a terrible dream

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,320
Until death is an incompetent king

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,070
Couldn't do anything

27
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,460
Just watching the world slowly being destroyed

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,180
A terrible dream of dying just like that

29
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,950
Who said anything?

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,390
Just a moment

31
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,930
Just stay like this

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,120
Just a moment

33
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,240
One minute then

34
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,530
I will be your Zhao Huazhen

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,210
(Episode 10: Living in a Nightmare)

36
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,730
You really became the Queen Mother.

37
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,260
I knew you would be chosen.

38
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,800
I want to tell His Highness the truth

39
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,730
Can't be controlled by the past anymore

40
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,790
Niangniang

41
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,470
I have something to say to His Highness.

42
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,840
His Highness and His Majesty went out.

43
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,260
The father-in-law is not at home either.

44
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,950
originally

45
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,640
Not only can it help His Highness, but it can also bring down the Central Palace.

46
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,070
What to do

47
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
Niangniang

48
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,480
It's time to wash up

49
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,700
oops

50
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you awake?

51
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,260
What's going on?

52
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,130
That's right

53
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,700
I almost touched it.

54
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Almost died

55
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,620
I don't know how much you weigh.

56
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,760
Really dangerous

57
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,820
No account books

58
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,000
Did you save me?

59
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,510
Just you

60
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,110
Didn't you say you can't let anyone know?

61
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,410
I really used the power of my soul

62
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,760
I can

63
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,910
There was a record of carrying 150 kg

64
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,410
Strength does not come from muscles

65
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,150
But from the will and the soul

66
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,300
Why

67
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,220
Why go to the well in the middle of the night?

68
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,570
that

69
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,370
It was too dark so I didn't see a well.

70
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,130
Just fell down like that

71
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,750
Is it night blindness?

72
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,030
How did you fall into a well that is hard to climb out of?

73
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,110
Are you up?

74
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,430
Wait a moment

75
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,640
Wait a moment

76
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,970
Okay, please come in.

77
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,770
oops

78
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,220
oops

79
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,650
If I had known you were going to live in the main house

80
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,480
I should prepare a bigger quilt.

81
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,830
Dad, please.

82
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,250
Dad, no, Dad, Dad

83
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,670
Dad, I can't.

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,850
dad

85
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,450
Fear

86
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,590
You are serious.

87
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,740
Thanks to the father-in-law, you were very comfortable during this period.

88
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,870
I can't bother you anymore. I plan to go back to the palace today.

89
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,830
What's bothering me? Don't say that.

90
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,140
I am also telling you what the Queen Mother said.

91
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,570
The Queen Mother is looking for you

92
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,030
You to her

93
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,810
It's really important

94
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,020
That?

95
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,050
Because I'm not in the palace, it's a mess

96
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,950
yes

97
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,830
No matter how hard and tiring it is

98
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,000
That's good.

99
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,130
Don't worry about anything

100
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,050
Just make the central hall.

101
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,270
Although I have many shortcomings as a father

102
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,680
Don't forget I'm behind you

103
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,360
OK

104
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Slow down, Your Highness

105
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,460
I know it's a bit shameless to say this

106
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,170
We entrust our Queen Mother to you.

107
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
In order not to make the nave feel lonely

108
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,950
I will work harder

109
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,220
oops

110
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,940
I am terrified

111
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,400
Let's go

112
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,190
Although I pretend to be the most loving father in the world

113
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,470
In fact, they are greedy people who treat their children as props.

114
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,120
Even let his daughter

115
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,710
Marry someone who wants to kill you

116
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,090
Is that why he wanted to kill Kim So Rong?

117
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,810
Why do you look like you've lost your country again?

118
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,630
No

119
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,310
If it's not the country, then what else has been lost?

120
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,410
Oh, is it true?

121
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,670
How is it possible?

122
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,090
Today is a happy day for the Queen to return to the palace safely.

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,300
Although it looks like this

124
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,490
But this is already a very happy expression

125
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,100
Already used to it

126
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,930
Has the bloody revenge really begun?

127
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,420
but

128
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,790
I feel like I've lost something very important.

129
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,410
I always feel that there is a very important task

130
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,880
Dafa is so handsome

131
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,840
So cool

132
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,730
That's right

133
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,890
Conferring the title of harem

134
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,170
I forgot such an important thing.

135
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
I have something important to do. I'm leaving now.

136
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,630
Hurry up and go

137
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,670
I said

138
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,850
Why run?

139
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,970
sorry

140
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,270
Walk slower.

141
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,970
Oh, really.

142
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,080
nave

143
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,680
Your Highness

144
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,410
Let's go back first.

145
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,370
Where is Shangshan?

146
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,580
Already caught

147
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,580
Can't find it?

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,370
Disappeared

149
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,690
Did the father-in-law find out and move it?

150
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,210
That's not the case

151
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,310
When I left

152
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,960
There's no change in attitude.

153
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,340
The father-in-law can't hide his emotions

154
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,190
Is that the person?

155
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,370
The Masked Imperial Guard

156
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,250
If it has fallen into Jin Zuogen's hands

157
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,490
The account book should no longer exist.

158
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,680
He couldn't possibly know the new hiding place.

159
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,660
That's the problematic thing.

160
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,150
The father-in-law couldn't possibly tell anyone that it was lost.

161
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,440
A person is anxious there

162
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,250
but

163
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,840
Will you find the whereabouts of the account book?

164
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
He will take action himself

165
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,320
Send someone to follow the father-in-law.

166
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,110
yes

167
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,100
The ledger has disappeared

168
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,300
Just give up on this.

169
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,080
If there is no

170
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,950
All our plans have gone to waste.

171
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,110
Can't give up so easily

172
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,060
Just be polite as before

173
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,920
Come quickly, come quickly, go over there

174
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,740
Niangniang

175
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,590
Hello Choi Sang-Gong

176
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,960
Niangniang

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,850
I miss you so much

178
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,970
Choi Sang-Gong

179
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,680
You gather all the women in North Korea together.

180
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,000
besides

181
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,770
Don't lose any of the Han family's genealogy

182
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,840
Find them all

183
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,920
From now on, I will confer the title of Empress

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,150
By selecting a survey account that takes its course

185
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,890
Sure enough, enthroning the harem is the correct answer

186
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,090
That's right

187
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,480
I have to pay my respects to our King and Queen.

188
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,630
Look forward to it

189
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,900
The Soul of Jang Bong-hwan

190
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,500
Merged with Kim So-yong's memories

191
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,260
The perfect nave

192
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,680
Cosplay

193
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,070
The King and the Concubine

194
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,800
I wonder if you are in good health during this period.

195
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,820
Where exactly has the change been?

196
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,310
I always feel something is different

197
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,970
I went back to my mother's home and found my original intention

198
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,380
It's a blessing

199
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,900
During this period, you feel worried and anxious

200
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,380
Always embracing and loving me

201
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,960
The Queen Mother's Heart

202
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,930
It scares me again

203
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,000
I want to undo my past mistakes

204
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,230
I will do my best to fulfill my duties as the Central Palace.

205
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,250
Let's start with the important things first.

206
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,990
I understand, I understand

207
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,020
I am here to carry out your mission.

208
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Only then would he rush back to the palace as soon as he recovered.

209
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,990
It is indeed the Central Palace.

210
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,920
I was only away for two days.

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,860
But that matter has always been on my mind.

212
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,760
How can you be so connected to me?

213
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,280
So

214
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,010
Now

215
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,680
immediately

216
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,290
us

217
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,930
nave

218
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,460
well done

219
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,740
That's not what I thought.

220
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,580
Niangniang

221
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,220
Please teach us more.

222
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,560
I've become hopeless.

223
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,630
Since you want to reveal your secrets

224
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,490
I am not yet good enough to teach apprentices.

225
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,370
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

226
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,190
You may be able to come in without permission.

227
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,810
But don't think about going out casually.

228
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,310
Concubine Yi

229
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,240
His Majesty has entered the palace

230
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,650
Yeah

231
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,720
Do you want to go to Seonjeongjeon right away?

232
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,580
No, I'm going to another palace.

233
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,970
The fire is too weak.

234
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,650
The food is all sticky together.

235
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,060
The flames are really coming out

236
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,870
Huh

237
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,490
I see fire in the eyes of the experienced people.

238
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,060
How come?

239
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,070
I just want to learn.

240
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,820
Only then will your eyes be filled with enthusiasm

241
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,500
But when will you teach me how to cook?

242
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,650
Kitchen survival rules

243
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,390
What do those who know the truth say?

244
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,840
I usually find a kitchen to study in.

245
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,540
At first, I could only peel onions.

246
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,750
Please make a good fire for me first

247
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,020
Ouch

248
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,560
That's because I've been working in the imperial kitchen for thirty years.

249
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,620
It has been twelve years since I became an expert.

250
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,420
Do you remember it in such detail?

251
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,450
Why don't you remember the exact date?

252
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,010
Look at your improper learning attitude

253
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,500
Forget it. I won't teach you anymore.

254
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,360
Niang Niang Niang Niang

255
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,710
Is this ok?

256
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,890
Yeah, like this.

257
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,390
so

258
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,740
Open it and see

259
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,030
Get out of the way

260
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,790
Are you peeking now?

261
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,850
Corporate espionage

262
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,630
No, I just wanted to see if the fire was just right.

263
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,990
Wait for the experienced to stop thinking

264
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
Leave all the thinking to me

265
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,000
Why do you always want to cross the line?

266
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,180
If soup and rice are the soul food of the common people

267
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,550
The soul food of the two classes is beef bone soup after all.

268
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,690
And then I'm going to add the French beef recipe to this

269
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,060
Using egg white to eliminate meat odor

270
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,540
protein

271
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,700
There is such a usage

272
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,590
MILF

273
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,450
Is this enough?

274
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,220
Oh, that's good.

275
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,160
What do you want to do?

276
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,550
That is food that can touch the soul.

277
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,660
Soul?

278
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,770
very good

279
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,220
Then the finishing touch

280
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,340
Is it ready outside?

281
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,060
It's the queen

282
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,980
The bubble is gone and you can't stay

283
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,140
With this mood

284
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,250
Ensuring safety and speed

285
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,910
good

286
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,020
Set off

287
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,340
It's the queen

288
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,160
Get started

289
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,330
The most terrifying thing is the familiar taste

290
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,910
Niangniang

291
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,380
sandalwood

292
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I was afraid that I would never see my mother again.

293
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm scared to death.

294
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,720
Really

295
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,800
Thank you so much

296
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,030
I actually made our Tan Xiang worried.

297
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,970
It seems that the queen really needs to teach herself a lesson.

298
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,800
sorry

299
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,780
this

300
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,280
Am I seeing it wrong now?

301
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,910
Is there rice in this?

302
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,080
In my opinion, it is also rice

303
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,840
Did she make soup and rice for me?

304
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,520
Imperial meals must have soup and rice served separately

305
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,960
She actually soaked the rice in the soup for me to eat

306
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,120
Do you want to return it?

307
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,080
This can...

308
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,180
yes

309
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,220
Considering the sincerity of the middle temple,

310
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,810
I'll try it first.

311
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,300
yes

312
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,020
All along

313
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,470
I count every day I spend in the imperial kitchen

314
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,520
With this confidence, I have survived till now.

315
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,530
But I actually overnight

316
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,190
Reduced to a fireman

317
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,350
This is the Queen Mother of the Central Palace

318
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,790
It's not that I'm so bad.

319
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,290
But the food in the middle hall is too good

320
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,250
Really

321
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,850
MILF

322
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,790
Damn

323
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,010
MILF

324
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,830
you also

325
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,000
you also

326
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,220
MILF

327
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,040
Damn it, you're taking it too far.

328
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,590
A young girl

329
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,620
Hey you

330
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,600
Do you think that experienced people are easy to bully?

331
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,990
It really is

332
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,120
I feel much happier.

333
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,260
Choi Sang-Gong, when are you

334
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,690
I'm not as serious as you.

335
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,870
I was really humiliated by my empress.

336
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,470
That's why I lost my mind for a while.

337
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,500
You don't have to face the stove all day long.

338
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,960
What are you doing?

339
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,740
No, that's not what I meant.

340
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,390
Are you

341
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,470
Are you

342
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,430
I

343
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,600
Don't come over here

344
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,670
All right

345
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,820
Excuse me

346
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,970
Really

347
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,760
If you say something bad about the lady again

348
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,320
I feel like I'm becoming the same person as him.

349
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,630
But the pressure in my heart has to be relieved

350
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,480
I really

351
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,300
I really want to quit.

352
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,530
There

353
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,140
How could he be there?

354
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,600
OMG

355
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,880
Absolutely not

356
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,740
Never, never, never

357
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,280
Absolutely not.

358
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
No, no, absolutely not

359
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,130
The Queen Mother and the Queen Mother request an audience

360
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,270
Let her in

361
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,980
Finished

362
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,330
Soul food will only be useful if she has a soul.

363
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,950
Niangniang

364
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,440
I just left the imperial kitchen for a while

365
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,180
So the food seems to be a bit off.

366
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,230
This taste seems familiar

367
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,620
I don't know, but I'm so familiar with it

368
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,060
Your craftsmanship is truly horrible.

369
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,630
Even my long forgotten memories

370
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,390
I've asked you to give me the strategy.

371
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,210
Good boy

372
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,100
Mother

373
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,710
Niangniang

374
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,230
There are grains of rice on your mouth

375
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,060
presumptuous

376
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,620
But you want to keep this great technology to yourself

377
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,780
Is it not worth teaching an experienced person?

378
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,920
Um

379
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,810
I'm not really happy with him.

380
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,700
Then I killed him immediately

381
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,920
After all, there was an arsenic case before.

382
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,290
Arsenic?

383
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,950
Don't you know?

384
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
The reason why you become a corpse

385
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,280
It's all because of the poison in the imperial kitchen.

386
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,340
poison

387
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,750
How did I get better so quickly?

388
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,540
Although the experienced ones are a little inflexible

389
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,460
But you took his job away so suddenly

390
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,130
What Works

391
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,850
I mean cut his neck.

392
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,920
Who got the account book?

393
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,700
Than who took it

394
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,590
More importantly, why take it away?

395
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,480
Will it become our poison?

396
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,740
Or a good medicine?

397
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,790
Whether he lost his job or his life

398
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,440
What does it have to do with me?

399
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,050
She always mentions this to me.

400
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,400
It seems that it is not impossible for the Queen to be deposed.

401
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,590
How can I spare the energy to think about him now?

402
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,080
It's hard to protect myself

403
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,820
Isn't that Cheoljong over there?

404
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,050
Your Highness

405
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,030
The Queen Mother is here

406
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,190
What are you doing?

407
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,890
I heard that the women of the Wang family all walk like this

408
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,490
After all, I am also a perfect queen.

409
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,490
who

410
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,550
Who said that?

411
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,930
What did Choi Sang-Gong say?

412
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,830
Isn't it?

413
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,640
No, I mean who said you are the perfect nave.

414
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,810
As you can see, it is exactly what I said.

415
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,240
It's terrible

416
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,920
You should just continue as usual.

417
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,500
By the way, what does our Highness prefer?

418
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,450
Sexy, cute, pure

419
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,250
What's the meaning

420
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,210
Um

421
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,060
I am following the order of the Queen Mother

422
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,390
I want to choose a few harem for you

423
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,140
It's a harem anyway.

424
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,090
I want to consider your orientation.

425
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,490
Harem

426
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,010
Harem?

427
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,940
Look at this guy

428
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,610
Finally starting to show its true colors

429
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,510
That's a good idea.

430
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,660
Feel sorry

431
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm so happy

432
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,380
Um

433
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,900
I have something I want to explain to you.

434
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,720
Even though you are the king

435
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,910
But I advise you to throw away the harem. It's your women.

436
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,960
Such backward and primitive ideas

437
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,490
After all, the harem does not belong to you

438
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,660
You said it well

439
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,060
You mean

440
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,950
be mine

441
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,910
What

442
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,040
I said the harem is mine

443
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,720
So don't even think about coming to the harem or the other palaces.

444
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,410
Anyway, you only need one Yipin

445
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,260
good

446
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,960
but

447
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,000
I also have a condition

448
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,100
Excuse me

449
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,980
What to do

450
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,180
Nothing

451
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,470
I decide the door.

452
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,960
What

453
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,900
don't want

454
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,540
I care more about appearance than background.

455
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,460
Appearance

456
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,450
If this is true

457
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,900
I can only go to the Queen Mother

458
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,850
I strongly express that I don't need to appoint a harem

459
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,260
knew

460
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,160
but

461
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,000
We don't touch each other's field

462
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,750
I'm responsible for the appearance and you're responsible for the home

463
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,410
Zhongdian, you are indeed my anti-fan

464
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,750
I had a lot of worries.

465
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,620
But now there is a way

466
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,790
No laughing

467
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,060
No laughing

468
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,570
You are not allowed to grab my hand suddenly like you just did.

469
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,090
Don't hold me down.

470
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,600
Nothing is allowed?

471
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,430
You're right.

472
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,990
Anyway, you are not allowed

473
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,710
I shouldn't have come to talk to him.

474
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,920
Gone

475
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,430
That's the middle hall.

476
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,560
Are you going to see His Highness?

477
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,120
I want to go back to the palace

478
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,490
Is this what you're looking for?

479
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,280
Was the person who put it here a palace servant?

480
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,010
Um

481
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,130
It's a young face

482
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,040
And she was wearing palace clothes

483
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,210
Do you still remember what it looked like?

484
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,910
That depends on how much you pay.

485
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,050
I'll come back when I find someone.

486
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,060
The clearer your memory of the palace people is,

487
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,280
The price will also be higher

488
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Come in

489
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,040
No matter how I look at it, this is bought.

490
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,140
Do you mean this is a fake identity?

491
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,270
Not a brand new forgery

492
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,470
Instead, they borrowed the household registration of a deceased or missing person.

493
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,060
If someone can do this perfectly

494
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,170
Should have paid a high price

495
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,580
Thank you very much

496
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,150
Just to become a lower-ranking warrior

497
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,110
It took so much effort

498
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,990
Your Highness, I have something to give you in private.

499
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,750
I'll wait for you at the old place.

500
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,440
Concubine Yi

501
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,330
Yongping Jun went out of the palace to do some business

502
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,580
Then please ask Gao Shanggong to personally

503
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,300
Tell His Majesty.

504
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,630
yes

505
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,390
This is her letter to His Majesty.

506
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,670
If she hadn't seen the affection between His Highness and the Queen

507
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,980
How could this happen?

508
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,540
The Imperial Conference will begin in a moment.

509
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,680
yes

510
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,780
You can take a short rest before sending it off.

511
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,950
yes

512
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,780
This is the letter from Concubine Yi to you.

513
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,050
I'm sure you ministers have been very busy while I'm away.

514
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,180
I have nothing to do after I come back.

515
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

516
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,380
For the ministers who have worked so hard

517
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,020
I want to give a banquet on Dragon Boat Festival

518
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,750
War and resentment grow

519
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,190
Rewarding the Ministers

520
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,240
People

521
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,450
They think the country doesn't care about them.

522
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,480
And hold a grand banquet

523
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,130
therefore

524
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,060
This is not what a king should do.

525
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,040
but

526
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,500
Yeongjo was also sick to celebrate and recovered after a few months.

527
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,010
There is a precedent for rewarding a banquet.

528
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,880
The nave too

529
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,070
Because I'm overworked and lack of energy during this period

530
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,720
Recovering from cadaveric syncope

531
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,630
Isn't this something worth celebrating?

532
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,410
The reason why the Queen Mother suffered from cadaver coma is still under investigation

533
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,760
Unable to determine the cause

534
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,820
I saw that she recovered after two days of treatment.

535
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,270
I just need a break.

536
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,820
but

537
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,840
Since the Queen Mother

538
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,520
Overcame the serious illness and recovered safely

539
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,920
Announcement through a small banquet

540
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,940
It is legitimate

541
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,230
That's right

542
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,580
This is the moral duty of a husband.

543
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,480
It's the king's duty.

544
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,480
Your Highness

545
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,460
This is absolutely not allowed

546
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,870
Killing the Queen is such a serious matter

547
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,330
The words that ended hastily by entering the banquet

548
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,530
Military Affairs Minister

549
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,790
Are you not happy to see the healing of the nave?

550
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,210
Could it be

551
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,060
Do you hope that someone will harm the central palace?

552
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,140
that

553
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,900
How come?

554
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,830
The military judge is more concerned about the safety of the central palace.

555
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,110
Is it more important to use this to achieve political goals?

556
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,360
Please calm down, Your Highness.

557
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,520
If you insist on doing so

558
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,390
We ministers will gratefully accept your highness's kindness.

559
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,190
So please look forward to it

560
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,350
Is it because you rested well?

561
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,190
Full of desire

562
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,640
Using barbarians to control barbarians

563
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,470
The foreigners must be forced to retreat by foreigners

564
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,860
Let's create a new force that can fight against the Anseong Jin family.

565
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,960
Manufacturing?

566
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,540
Using the harem canonization that the Zhongdian is responsible for

567
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,090
Please take a look at this if you are experienced

568
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,400
Hmm, does it taste good?

569
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,920
Where

570
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,930
Bring me some more salt.

571
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,840
This is not okay

572
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,140
That one is too thin. Redo it.

573
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,180
What are you doing so seriously?

574
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,420
after

575
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,010
Dishes made with camel cheese will be popular

576
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,980
We can't let the calves starve all the time.

577
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,920
By Not Actually Camel Cheese

578
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,960
Can also make that taste

579
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,400
How did people make molecular cuisine in the Joseon Dynasty?

580
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,140
I'm especially serious today.

581
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,080
Waiting for experienced people

582
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,990
Feeling the face of sadness and joy

583
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,800
There must be a long queue of family members waiting for him to support them.

584
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,540
Please tell me

585
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,780
Put out the fire here.

586
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,640
With that little shoulder

587
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,690
Carrying the weight of being the head of the family alone

588
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,640
I don't even know your name.

589
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,100
May I have your name

590
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,720
My name is Wanfu

591
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,370
Who are the family members?

592
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,490
Although there must be more than 10 wives and children

593
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,540
I am alone

594
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,490
What

595
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,750
Lived alone and freely for a while

596
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,420
Even so, there are still people to feed.

597
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,140
Think about it

598
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,810
Feed fish heads to stray cats when passing by

599
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,660
That's right

600
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,900
You see

601
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,130
There is no blessing

602
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,120
Those stray cats will starve.

603
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,840
I'm not doing this for your sake.

604
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,420
But for the sake of those cats

605
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,060
Let me tell you the secret

606
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,670
Holy Grace

607
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,220
So disgusting. Why do you do this?

608
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,330
well

609
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,070
that

610
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,320
Give me the paper

611
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,690
Hong Yan

612
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,310
Tell the bearers here

613
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,330
Send to the royal doctor

614
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,160
yes

615
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,820
Recommend some medicinal herbs that are good for the skin and have a good aroma

616
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,570
If you don't do your job well, be careful of job changes.

617
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,710
Job Change

618
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,650
There seems to be something written behind it.

619
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,500
There are not enough eunuchs to help the harem to be enthroned

620
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,860
Why is there a shortage of eunuchs every month?

621
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,760
Your Highness

622
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,120
Walk slowly or you'll get hurt.

623
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,500
Where are the books related to the banquet?

624
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,580
Slave

625
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,030
Come and find it

626
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,710
I would definitely like to refer to the banquet of Yeongjo's Gapa

627
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,490
yes

628
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,270
I went to Xuanzheng Hall to look for someone.

629
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,100
I heard you were here.

630
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,540
Why are you here?

631
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,280
I think about this period of time

632
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,160
Have you neglected the Lord too much?

633
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,930
I want to talk to you

634
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,160
Please drink

635
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,210
I wonder if it's because the master brewed the tea himself.

636
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,970
The taste is more mysterious

637
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,350
Seeing the Lordâ€™s words

638
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,420
I will think of the late king

639
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,810
so

640
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,610
It's hard to get close to the Lord

641
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,580
I don't understand this feeling. I'm really scared.

642
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,790
Ai Jia

643
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,790
I think I know the late king well.

644
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,330
Maybe the former king

645
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,250
Ai's Son

646
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,490
He is a king beyond my imagination.

647
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,050
Fighting against the Kim family to establish the kingship

648
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,090
I couldn't lead my family.

649
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,660
More support for the wishes of the late king

650
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,840
Feeling very sorry

651
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,890
Please don't blame yourself

652
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,400
The former king also

653
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,150
Don't want this

654
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,230
maybe

655
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,420
Through the Lord

656
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,040
Can I undo my mistake towards the previous king?

657
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,370
I am far inferior to the previous king.

658
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,310
Yeah

659
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,730
If I had the same will as the previous king

660
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,250
Please be sure

661
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,410
Reach out to me

662
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,860
The same mistake as before

663
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,610
It will never happen again

664
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,190
My son, please remember

665
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,510
Today I seem to have a better understanding of the Lord.

666
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,760
very nice

667
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,660
It is my honor

668
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,700
Please take a rest

669
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,850
His Majesty has arrived

670
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,530
sorry

671
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,090
Have you been waiting for a long time?

672
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,280
Go out for a while

673
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,600
I thought you weren't coming.

674
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,030
I'll be back soon.

675
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,690
Because I read the letter very late

676
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,400
Looks very busy.

677
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,080
I can't even read letters.

678
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,880
actually

679
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,960
The Queen Mother found me and talked to me for a while

680
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,880
What did you talk about?

681
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,670
Just chatting

682
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,300
Your Highness

683
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,600
There are more and more secrets being kept from me.

684
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,820
So what did you talk about with the Queen?

685
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,220
Today at the lake

686
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,040
You saw it

687
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,680
Is there anything I can't see?

688
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,280
No

689
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,160
Chatted about the canonization of the harem

690
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,810
Harem

691
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,850
You'll probably be unhappy to hear that.

692
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,210
It is necessary to divert the attention of the Jin family

693
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,530
Establish new forces that can participate in the competition

694
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,770
The constraints on the crown will also be weakened

695
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,510
so

696
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,630
Did she express happiness?

697
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,740
Yes

698
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,020
This is the Queen's plan.

699
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,720
Concubine

700
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,280
How can you call me like that?

701
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,190
How come you never call my name again?

702
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,980
His Highness once said

703
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,700
I am the one who made His Highness happy and sad.

704
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,320
Now

705
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,090
Has the person who can shake His Highness' mood changed?

706
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:29,930
Flowers are real

707
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,890
Tell me

708
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,710
Your Highness's Sincerity

709
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:39,180
Does His Highness have feelings for the Queen?

710
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,060
The focus of Western food is seasoning and presentation

711
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,080
Especially the presentation is the flower of Western cuisine

712
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,700
Come

713
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,620
Use this

714
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,910
Can soup give off different flavors?

715
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,130
But why are you alone?

716
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,330
What

717
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,760
I was doing things and before I knew it, I was the only one left.

718
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,740
What about parents and brothers?

719
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,230
In the year of Yixu, all of them were killed by thieves.

720
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Then I became one.

721
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,060
My father believed those people

722
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,210
So I don't believe anything

723
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,740
Alone

724
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,710
It must be lonely.

725
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,000
There are more than one or two people like me.

726
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,020
It's a bit lonely when there's only one person left during the festival

727
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,240
But the good thing is

728
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,320
Everyone died at once.

729
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,540
So the sacrifice only needs to be done once.

730
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,190
What?

731
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,330
Why is it so?

732
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,800
How do you know that I am against sad men?

733
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,250
It's easy to soften your heart

734
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,000
Is it sour?

735
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,550
The food has turned sour.

736
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,580
It's the cook's sad words.

737
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,050
Food will become sour

738
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,210
I understand

739
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,750
So before I entered the imperial kitchen

740
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,040
Whether happy or sad

741
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,040
I will throw it away first.

742
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,780
I see you crying every day

743
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:19,500
That's because

744
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,970
The Queen Mother wanders around all day and it's annoying

745
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,340
This should be blamed on my lack of practice.

746
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,360
Why are you blaming others?

747
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,800
Look, look, look, look.

748
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,000
Look, look.

749
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,740
Are you speaking plain language now?

750
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,480
Please look at it. Please look at it.

751
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,140
More fire

752
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,920
Just throw your head out.

753
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,280
Blame me for being soft-hearted

754
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,600
It hasn't been long since I last had a meal.

755
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,540
Come

756
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,030
Please don't eat

757
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,280
Give in to your skin

758
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,450
That's why things exist.

759
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,920
From K-food to K-beauty

760
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,070
It's a great day for drying peppers.

761
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,250
Empress of the Middle Temple

762
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,410
I didn't see you yesterday.

763
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,970
I don't know if it was because of the hangover.

764
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,520
Can you move a little bit?

765
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
I have something to ask you

766
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,990
Do you still remember what happened before you went to the countryside?

767
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,890
Strange or suspicious behavior

768
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,200
If you want to talk about suspicious actions

769
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,480
Who is it referring to?

770
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,000
No matter who it is

771
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,400
In fact

772
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,430
My fainting seems to be related to that world

773
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,460
Does that world refer to other forces?

774
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,300
no

775
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,040
Anyway

776
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,780
I mean it happens naturally.

777
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,240
Although you may be shocked, I want to tell you

778
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,260
I have doubts about the Lord

779
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,720
After understanding

780
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,220
Those who want to harm the queen in Wuta Pavilion

781
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,240
He is the one who read the horoscope for His Majesty.

782
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,550
It really shocked me.

783
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,160
How do you know?

784
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,190
No one else knows

785
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,830
Did you know

786
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,260
that

787
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,640
that is

788
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:13,540
This is because we are

789
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,160
There are many things involved

790
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,130
So we cover up the past for each other.

791
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,050
My lady, even now that you know all this, are you still like this?

792
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,540
No matter what the Lord did

793
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,760
Will the intention of the rebels never change?

794
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,010
What

795
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,350
Conspiracy

796
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,460
How can you say such terrible things?

797
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,590
I want to live well here.

798
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,470
You can't go against the Lord.

799
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,480
Just live without getting in each other's way

800
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,920
How can you think like that?

801
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,260
I was already in crisis because of the legitimacy of the matter.

802
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,620
How can you still call it a conspiracy?

803
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,180
What do you want me to do?

804
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,700
Choi Sang-Gong

805
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,280
Choi Sang-Gong

806
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,910
Sister, I'm coming

807
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,130
Where to go

808
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,980
Here

809
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,180
What is this?

810
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,340
Who would get through a rough day just to watch this?

811
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,360
What is this?

812
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,090
Sure enough, it was broken here.

813
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,080
I did this for my family.

814
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,160
What is this called?

815
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,280
It's called a facial mask

816
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,730
Looking for a replacement

817
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,440
Instead, they came up with new technology.

818
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,050
Niangniang

819
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,670
Kim Byeong-in

820
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,600
At this time?

821
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,000
Come in

822
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,020
I did receive a message saying hello.

823
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,250
But is it too late?

824
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,430
I couldn't convey this to you.

825
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,500
What made me dare to come to see the queen like this was

826
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,430
Because I have something to convey to my father away from his sight.

827
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,760
For the father

828
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,520
The Lord is different from the previous King.

829
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,060
But my father was wrong

830
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,200
Don't follow me

831
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:42,790
As agreed

832
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,610
this

833
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,570
It is red ginseng

834
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,000
this

835
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,620
Thanks

836
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,990
but

837
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,220
Nothing else?

838
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,060
What else are you talking about?

839
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,130
Say exactly what you want to say.

840
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,230
What do you want to say?

841
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,160
Just a greeting from time to time.

842
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,390
but

843
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,830
It seems that Byeong-in is still in the palace.

844
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,230
You are here, father-in-law

845
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,600
I'm back

846
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,080
A bit late

847
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,470
Because I haven't been able to spend much time with my colleagues since I took up my post.

848
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,240
So I just drank two cups

849
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,670
well done

850
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,640
It's late. Let's go in and have a rest.

851
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,870
yes

852
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,880
You guys chat.

853
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,690
Okay, you take a rest.

854
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,420
you

855
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,570
yes

856
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,620
Looks uneasy.

857
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,690
Originally

858
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,260
Something happened that was beyond my power.

859
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,610
I will feel uneasy.

860
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,620
What does this mean?

861
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,010
Caused dangerous things

862
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,070
Not just you

863
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,890
Even the Queen Mother will be in danger

864
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,290
How could you not understand?

865
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,060
If I feel uneasy

866
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,130
That's because we haven't caught the person who murdered the Queen.

867
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,210
Yeah

868
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,410
It's late.

869
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,030
Adults must be tired too.

870
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,250
I mainly want to convey gifts

871
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,070
I'll leave first.

872
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,680
Lost the account book

873
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,120
If you are not in the prison

874
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,590
Byeong-in is alone

875
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,540
If it is this time

876
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,670
Shouldn't

877
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,400
Thank you

878
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,160
This is not what I did

879
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,570
To find a corpse of similar size

880
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,980
It took some time

881
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,900
What kind of corpse is it?

882
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,670
The body was soaked in water for a long time.

883
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,040
So I can't recognize the face.

884
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,500
Tell me

885
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,280
Your Highness's Sincerity

886
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:39,630
Does His Highness have feelings for the Queen?

887
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,340
I

888
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,430
You can't have feelings for the middle temple.

889
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,510
No, no.

890
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,560
But you can't have it.

891
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,140
Niangniang

892
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,440
It's Yongping Jun

893
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,940
yes

894
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:17,830
Come in

895
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,860
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

896
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,430
Because there's news you should know.

897
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,800
Have you found the red moon?

898
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,390
Is this the gift from you?

899
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,300
That's right

900
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,710
If this is the answer

901
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,420
That's her.

902
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,710
Red Moon is still alive

903
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,260
Very good

904
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,040
Why are you making such a fuss about fetching water so late at night?

905
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,980
Don't let me go in advance.

906
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:16,410
What's stuck?

907
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,090
What is that?

908
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,590
Someone who looks similar to him was found in the harem

909
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,340
I'm more convinced after receiving this.

910
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,880
I actually

911
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,590
To help His Highness

912
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,480
Niangniang

913
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,610
Well

914
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,570
In the well?

915
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,140
Body found in well

916
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,820
Like the queen's servant Hongyue

917
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,210
Red Moon

918
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,460
It will be a big blow. I'm going

919
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,630
No, I want to see it with my own eyes.

920
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,180
It must have been in the water for a long time.

921
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,390
How suffocating and painful it is

922
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,070
Stop it

923
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:42,840
This is just the beginning

924
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:43,920
Niangniang

925
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,110
I want to stay alone

926
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:34,560
A person who makes people happy and sad

927
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,860
Your Highness, the Queen Mother has arrived.

928
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,960
Why

929
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,600
What are you watching

930
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,030
Looking at the previous appeal

931
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,850
Seeing His Majesty more eager than before

932
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,110
I'm curious about what you're doing privately so I came to see you.

933
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,870
This is a time to temporarily forget the worries of the court.

934
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,370
fortunately

935
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,280
I want your Highness to be happy.

936
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,840
My son is terrified

937
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,510
Your Highness has been through a very difficult time.

938
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,490
Did you forget so quickly?

939
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,720
I don't know if fate is also inherited.

940
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,210
Know how to be honest and thankful for reality

941
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:50,460
Nothing will happen to me and the precious people around me.

942
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,900
Why can't you be honest?

943
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:01,230
