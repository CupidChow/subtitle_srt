1
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,280
(This drama is purely fictional, and the characters, groups, events, etc. that appear have nothing to do with history)

2
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,150
I have a lot to thank you for.

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,220
When I want to leave here

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,040
I also miss you

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,560
Because if I leave I will never see you again

6
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,820
(One hour ago)

7
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,840
(Dragon Beard Potato)

8
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,490
(Dragon Beard Potato is asleep?)

9
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,620
(Episode 14)

10
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,230
Yes, I wrote it.
(Episode 14)

11
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,460
Yes, I wrote it.

12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,700
Did you really write this?

13
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,260
Instead of the nave

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,040
The Queen Mother was still in the banquet hall at that time.

15
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,540
Then you use pine leaves and other things

16
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,170
And why is peach

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,150
That's because peaches are in season

18
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,020
The others are almost in season.

19
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,550
Pine leaves are in season all year round.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,020
Wanfu

21
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,070
Look into my eyes and answer me

22
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:14,642
The Queen Mother wanted to hide the fact that she helped His Highness.

23
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:21,602
It's too late

24
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,102
Let's come back tomorrow.

25
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:27,382
Brother, please go back.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,490
I must go in today

27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,310
Ask her why she helped me

28
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,940
What does betrayal mean?

29
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,730
Or wait till tomorrow morning

30
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,430
Report to His Highness again.

31
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,930
Will everything be alright tonight?

32
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,060
Don't be too anxious.

33
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,580
Maybe it's a trap.

34
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,000
You still sleep so peacefully.

35
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,420
I fell asleep

36
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,500
Have you been there watching me all this time?

37
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,600
How come you're always like this?

38
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,790
Try to worry about me and understand me

39
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,490
It seems so

40
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,450
You were also the first person I saw when I came here

41
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,410
I have a lot to thank you for.

42
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,550
When I want to leave here

43
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,260
I also miss you

44
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,390
Because if I leave I will never see you again

45
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,690
Hong Yan

46
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,140
Huh

47
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,480
It seems that our Hong Yan usually pays attention to exercise

48
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,440
Look at this muscle

49
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,420
I must be dreaming

50
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,280
I had the same dream last time while holding Hong Yan.

51
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,010
You woke up

52
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,470
What the hell is this?

53
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
What the hell

54
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,480
What's wrong

55
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,750
Who did something bad to the middle temple?

56
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,930
bad thing

57
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,460
you

58
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,950
Isn't it you guy?

59
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,580
How did your face suddenly appear here?

60
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,820
What

61
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,220
Tell me the truth

62
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,540
What happened between us last night?

63
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,800
How to be honest

64
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,220
Don't miss a single word.

65
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,440
This is a really rare hobby.

66
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,620
If you insist on doing so

67
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,480
The white moon cuts through the deep darkness

68
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,430
The nave passed by my body

69
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,180
spark...

70
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,460
Don't say it

71
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,560
If you dare to say I killed you

72
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,570
this...

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,830
This is just the beginning.

74
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,320
nave

75
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
oh oh

76
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,940
How do I feel

77
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,950
I was abandoned

78
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,940
Really

79
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,130
Shang Shan

80
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,210
Hong Yan

81
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Hong Yan Hong Yan

82
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,000
Where did you sleep last night?

83
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,050
Of course it's the backyard, my lady.

84
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,300
Then I really and Cheoljong...

85
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,850
Madam...

86
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,640
(Episode 14: The Woman Who Dies and Lives)

87
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,070
I am dreaming.

88
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,660
Burning in the dream

89
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,030
It's so realistic.

90
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,530
Since the death of the Bodhisattva

91
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,100
I haven't done any divination.

92
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,320
Still a little uneasy

93
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,650
Han Shanggong, I want to have a good fortune telling

94
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,300
My lady, be careful not to get into trouble again.

95
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,610
I have a monk I know.

96
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,590
Don't worry, it won't look suspicious to outsiders.

97
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,050
(monk text)

98
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,430
What did you see?

99
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,880
The palace illuminated by red light

100
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,810
Red light

101
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,750
The Palace Today

102
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,390
Someone will die

103
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,170
Who is it...

104
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,560
I don't know either.

105
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,770
A woman

106
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,370
female...

107
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,220
Could it be...

108
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,720
It's not me

109
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,560
Write me a spell.

110
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,200
The spell that protects me

111
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,110
Poor Monk

112
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
Not a witch

113
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,460
Well, you should have some solution.

114
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,300
If this is true

115
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,550
Please offer some offerings to the Buddha.

116
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,430
good

117
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,340
I provide

118
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,130
today

119
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,870
The woman who died in the palace

120
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,770
It can't be me

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,830
Damn

122
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,220
I forgot to ask the question I wanted to ask.

123
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,020
I want to go back to the Dazao Palace

124
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,440
Your Highness

125
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,980
Still a bit suspicious

126
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,220
Disappearing suddenly

127
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,130
That's right

128
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,100
Then I will draw the portrait myself.

129
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,910
I chose you

130
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,630
How did it become like this?

131
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,420
Start over again

132
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,850
very good

133
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,890
Not doing it anymore

134
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:27,840
I don't do it anymore

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,690
Let's try again.

136
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
It's this face

137
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,920
Hongbiejian

138
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,950
Did you cry all the way here?

139
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,060
Okay, okay, okay.

140
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,180
Okay, okay.

141
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,540
Why didn't I think she might not like me?

142
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,200
Why go?

143
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,960
Choose family, choose love

144
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,840
Spend several nights worrying about this matter

145
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,980
The greatest difficulty of love is

146
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,130
No other obstacles

147
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,520
But to get the other person's intention

148
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,100
So what is her reason?

149
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,780
So what

150
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,240
The girl doesn't like you

151
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,770
What

152
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,760
So...

153
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,520
woman

154
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,050
Tell me the reason.

155
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,600
At least tell me the reason.

156
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,670
Why on earth do you dislike me

157
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,780
Little girl...

158
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,290
I don't like ambitious men.

159
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,970
Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,240
Moist

161
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,810
Love

162
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,910
It started out wet

163
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,200
Wet end

164
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,790
But

165
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,720
I was scared to death

166
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,380
There is another good news.

167
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,180
Your Majesty has recovered.

168
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,910
My prayers worked so fast.

169
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,060
You may have heard other news.

170
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,030
Well, Mr. Kim Jageun, because of that incident

171
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,920
You got into trouble, didn't you?

172
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,940
I like His Majesty and I respect you very much.

173
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,640
My heart is now split in two

174
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,440
Don't you have no relationship with the Lord?

175
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Why do you like him?

176
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,790
That's because he's your good friend.

177
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,540
You are such a good person

178
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,860
Friends must be good too.

179
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,750
You really are

180
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,890
Are you drawing an octopus?

181
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,180
Who is drawing the octopus?

182
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,710
It's human

183
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,940
This one?

184
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,340
If you look carefully, it's actually a good painting.

185
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,430
Yeah, this is the eyes.

186
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,300
mouth

187
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,650
Is this a mouth?

188
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,510
I even painted my lips

189
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,310
As expected, I still have to do divination in the morning.

190
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,000
Queen Dowager Yipin requests an audience

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,310
Really

192
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,150
Overnight, your complexion has changed a lot.

193
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,180
Others would think that the Lord is still awake.

194
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,090
How's the situation at the middle temple?

195
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,770
I finally chose to give up the greater interests

196
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,010
I did as you said.

197
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,560
They should find it in the Nave's quarters.

198
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,770
last night

199
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,830
His Highness spent the night in the residence of the middle temple.

200
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,430
Have you just recovered?

201
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
Through what happened last night, I once again understood

202
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,130
Once you lose His Highness

203
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,130
The little girl will surely die

204
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,630
The woman who died today

205
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
Could it be...

206
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,450
I want to die

207
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,770
Why not just die?

208
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,600
I'll feel better if I die.

209
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,210
Your humble servant is terrified. Your humble servant is terrified.

210
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,040
I clearly caught it

211
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,080
His Highness insisted

212
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,760
What what do you mean

213
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,940
What

214
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,900
Where does the burning smell come from?

215
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,410
Which guy

216
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,130
Which guy is it?

217
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,430
Choi Sang-Gong Choi Sang-Gong

218
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,000
I accidentally

219
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,580
All said out

220
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,310
Yeah

221
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,440
The meaning of waiting for the experienced person is last night

222
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,030
After listening to the words of the experienced person, the master

223
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,320
You came to me and caused such trouble.

224
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,300
is that so

225
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,990
I didn't say that.

226
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,120
That's all the confusion I have right now.

227
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,870
It's all because of the experienced waiter.

228
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,590
What are you confused about?

229
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,770
Damn

230
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,970
Clearly very good

231
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,810
Maybe even more than before

232
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,360
That's why I feel like I'm going crazy

233
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,220
Why do you like it?

234
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,690
I can't do this.

235
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,140
Isn't the soul the master of the body?

236
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,490
Whether it is soul or body

237
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Can't they all be considered masters?

238
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,380
Are humans just slaves to hormones?

239
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,970
Niangniang

240
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,990
What happened to her?

241
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,240
What's the meaning

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,230
The Queen's behavior is very much like the Queen herself

243
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,170
Why won't the mood get bad?

244
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,110
Why

245
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,180
Come back

246
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,630
Come back, come back, come back

247
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,600
His Majesty has arrived

248
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,290
Where is the nave?

249
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,440
that

250
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,890
The fear was still there

251
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,950
Why on earth is she avoiding me?

252
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,940
Last night was like a tiger

253
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,440
Can you help me find the nave?

254
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,940
It's your highness

255
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,670
As you can see I have a lot to say to her.

256
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,480
Your Highness

257
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,770
Why do I have so much to say to her?

258
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,060
No, it would be really dangerous if I met Cheoljong now.

259
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,400
What if my body betrays me again?

260
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,430
yes

261
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,770
It was this woman's spirit that controlled my body yesterday

262
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,730
I think it feels good because

263
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,350
I thought it was Hong Yan

264
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,090
If I had known that it was Cheoljong

265
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,740
I feel very happy.

266
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,330
Crazy really

267
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,530
Is Jang Bong-hwan going to stay here forever?

268
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,180
is that so

269
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,380
Empress of the Middle Temple

270
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,640
Niangniang

271
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,670
Empress of the Middle Temple

272
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,420
Niangniang

273
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,220
Empress of the Middle Temple

274
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,600
Niangniang

275
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,790
nave

276
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,600
nave

277
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,610
Empress of the Middle Temple

278
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,040
Niangniang

279
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,020
Niangniang

280
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,760
Niangniang

281
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,200
Niangniang

282
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,250
Empress of the Middle Temple

283
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,330
Niangniang

284
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,310
Niangniang

285
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,930
If you really want to assassinate the master openly

286
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,420
Mr. Kim Jageun is about to be impeached

287
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,680
This is true

288
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,180
Come to think of it, it doesn't look like this at all.

289
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,610
This is Master Kim Jageun's way

290
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
Maybe he was forced into this.

291
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,950
Because of the explosion

292
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,510
Mr. Kim Jageun lost everything

293
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,250
The Lord has received too much

294
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,920
Would the Lord risk his life?

295
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,620
Did you cause the explosion yourself?

296
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,930
Too

297
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,470
Startled

298
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,520
His Majesty the Lord

299
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,310
His Majesty the Lord

300
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,820
Are you going to the Imperial Council?

301
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes

302
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,580
Your Highness, why did you come here by yourself?

303
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,780
nave her

304
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,980
nave nave

305
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,710
Are you playing hide and seek, madam?

306
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,050
I'm good at playing this girl.

307
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,180
finally

308
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,470
Damn

309
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,940
Stop chasing.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
Are you a CCTV or a sasaeng fan?

311
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,480
Damn that one

312
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,490
Your Highness Nana

313
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,010
See you at the Imperial Conference

314
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,690
yes

315
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,090
Let's watch CCTV together

316
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,060
nave

317
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,060
They are really in love.

318
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,670
nave

319
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,150
Also playing hide and seek

320
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,850
Not a child either.

321
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,210
I said

322
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,150
Resurrection

323
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,320
Play hide and seek

324
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,610
Yes, I have a harem of sisters.

325
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,320
Sharing love through text messages all night

326
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,040
The guardian of my true identity

327
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,740
Hello, Your Majesty

328
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,920
Hello to you too

329
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,740
Goodbye then

330
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,770
nave

331
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,300
Can you run like that in the palace?

332
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,080
Between the two of them

333
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,790
It's none of our business.

334
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,630
Why

335
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,970
That's right

336
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,040
but

337
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,310
It's such a perfect match.

338
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,070
good

339
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,170

341
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,940
His Majesty the Lord

nave

343
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,830
There's none here either.

344
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,130
I have a question for the middle temple.

345
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,790
So I've been chasing

346
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,510
Do you have any questions?

347
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,690
It seems that the middle palace does not want to see me

348
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,510
That's it.

349
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,150
If you feel like facing me

350
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,660
The middle temple will contact me.

351
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,020
Let's go to the Imperial Conference

352
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,920
yes

353
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,060
It's here.

354
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,500
I have been looking for you in the palace for a long time.

355
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,250
What's up

356
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,180
You are here

357
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,270
Last night

358
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,340
Let's talk on the way

359
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:16,860
Let's go

360
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,910
Where to go next?

361
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,970
Where to go next?

362
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,170
This palace is too big.

363
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,340
Are you gone?

364
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,270
Oh damn

365
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,600
What do you want to ask?

366
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,130
Usually in this case

367
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,620
What the man wants to ask is

368
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,460
Because you like me?

369
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,000
Send it to the old place.

370
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,140
It's the queen

371
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,390
Something seems to be wrong.

372
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,250
Choi Sang-Gong

373
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,670
It's the queen

374
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,270
Why don't you nag me recently?

375
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,130
You can't dress like this, lady.

376
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,060
You should nag me.

377
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,770
I've stopped nagging, sis.

378
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,830
What's going on?

379
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,260
Go quickly. Go quickly.

380
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,030
yes

381
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,000
What's going on?

382
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,190
Get Started Today

383
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,070
(Return power to the government and remove the regency behind the scenes)

384
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,820
To withdraw the curtain and return power
(Return power to the government and remove the regency behind the scenes)

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,440
(Return power to the government and remove the regency behind the scenes)

386
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,160
From now on

387
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,990
Declaring personal rule

388
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,080
May you live forever, Your Highness

389
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,330
I'm going to die if I continue like this.

390
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,510
I can't live with anger.

391
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,640
Do you want to put away the imperial meal?

392
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,430
This is like holding a sacrifice right after I die.

393
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,000
The slaves are terrified

394
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,690
but

395
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,840
Meaning whether to serve the meal or not

396
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,240
If you present it, he will obviously get angry and ask if it is a sacrificial table.

397
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,800
I

398
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,630
To this

399
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,910
Tell you one by one...

400
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,020
Niangniang

401
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,720
Please stay calm

402
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,080
Can you calm down now?

403
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,850
This is the end of my political life.

404
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,710
I will find it back for you

405
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,910
I can definitely return to ruling from behind the scenes.

406
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,840
You are full of confidence

407
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,930
Your father was like this when he was young.

408
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,900
I gave my brother one last chance

409
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,350
What chance did you give?

410
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,580
It is said to be a way to destroy the Lord's heart

411
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,560
If my brother succeeds,

412
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,080
You hold your position first.

413
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,880
yes

414
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,110
But you'll understand that old tools have limitations.

415
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,300
The Lord is not an easy person to deal with.

416
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,240
Do you think the explosion was real?

417
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,770
Did the Lord do this?

418
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,020
Those who benefit the most

419
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,690
The criminal

420
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,040
I actually let that brat sit on the throne

421
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,610
Your Highness

422
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,530
Congratulations on taking charge of government affairs

423
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,780
Thanks

424
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,630
During your absence

425
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,340
A letter came from the Dazao Palace

426
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,100
Nave?

427
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,950
Yes

428
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,060
I miss you so much

429
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,650
Do you want to tell me?

430
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,320
Honey, I miss you so much

431
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,470
This is not good.

432
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,460
It's my last bastion.

433
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,890
Hot enough

434
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,840
Let's meet.

435
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
You are here

436
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,380
To save me from this mess...

437
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,120
Cheoljong

438
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,260
How do you know this place?

439
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,550
I said we'd meet here, so you know

440
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,370
It was Shuyi who called me here

441
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,250
Which Shuyi

442
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,890
Because I like the excitement of anonymity

443
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,540
So I deliberately didn't ask who it was.

444
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,660
In conclusion

445
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,500
Not You

446
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,270
I sometimes have wild thoughts

447
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,370
Thinking of you, it's okay to be half asleep

448
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,950
Come row towards me.

449
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,730
I didn't send you away

450
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Stop talking

451
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,680
Do you know now?

452
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:38,990
No

453
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,490
I don't know, that kind of corny poem

454
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,700
I call out the name of the dead

455
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,010
Can't forget to fall into deep thought...

456
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,820
Stop talking, people are here.

457
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,620
It's not written by the middle temple, so what does it matter?

458
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,730
We have something important to say.

459
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,050
Everyone, step back a little.

460
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:01,660
Got it?

461
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,870
It's the Queen, the Queen of the Central Palace

462
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,230
Are you spying on me?

463
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,100
Did you intercept my text message?

464
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,970
What are you talking about

465
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,070
When writing letters, I always woo you so passionately

466
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,700
Once we meet, we're like strangers.

467
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,040
How long did it take to get close...

468
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,220
Transmission accident? Transmission accident?

469
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,590
Did you mistake me for someone else?

470
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,770
My new source of hormones is you

471
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,970
The last bastion of my essence is you

472
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,970
The one who makes my heart beat every night

473
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,340
It's you

474
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,030
That's why he has two faces.

475
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,520
Why you?

476
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,170
Why is it always you?

477
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,580
As soon as I open my eyes, I see you, even in my dreams

478
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,590
Did you dream about me?

479
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,310
Don't be embarrassed

480
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,750
If it becomes awkward, then it's really set in stone.

481
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,720
There are several kinds of dreams

482
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,820
There are also nightmares that give people goose bumps

483
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,450
Why help the banquet?

484
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,730
Is this what you are pursuing now?

485
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,890
I thought you would thank me for helping me.

486
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,760
If you are happy, curse first

487
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,250
If you thank me, I will find fault with you, isn't that what you said?

488
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,780
Since when did you start listening to me?

489
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,560
You want to make trouble even if I listen to you

490
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,150
How much do I have to cooperate?

491
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,890
You said no touch but you suddenly helped me

492
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,320
Then he announced that he was going to betray me

493
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,160
That's me...

494
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,230
Wait a moment

495
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,200
Did you hear me say I was going to betray you?

496
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,750
Is it a lie to say that you have lost your hearing?

497
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,710
Wouldn't you...

498
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,630
Was the explosion also faked?

499
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,640
Hearing loss is a fact

500
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,070
When the middle temple said this, the tinnitus disappeared

501
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,990
hateful

502
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,880
Are you crazy?

503
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,440
Didn't he almost die?

504
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,640
nave

505
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,690
Do we have to use such a dangerous method?

506
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,190
you

507
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,760
I said it was forbidden.

508
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,470
Hold me like this, smile and lie beside me

509
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,290
I said they would ban everything.

510
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,130
I forbid you to say that

511
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,230
I like you, the middle palace

512
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,950
Do you fall in love immediately?

513
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,220
So old-fashioned, confessing just because you slept with me once

514
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,460
That's not the case.

515
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,080
So why do you like me?

516
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,750
The nave is arrogant

517
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,020
Rude and selfish actions

518
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,240
There is no consistency

519
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,250
A lot of shortcomings

520
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,690
So

521
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,590
So don't like me

522
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,460
I still like you

523
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,560
Even though you are the person with the most flaws in the world

524
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,810
Still like you

525
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,900
That night

526
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,290
The day I jumped into this lake

527
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,540
Do you still remember what I said to you?

528
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,250
You have to love me.

529
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,600
I believe that I am the only one who can protect you

530
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,850
That's why I said that

531
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,950
Only if you love me can I become your strength

532
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,630
Only this way you can survive

533
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,790
I can survive.

534
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,400
Is that what you mean?

535
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,310
but

536
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,570
The Kim So-rong of that time is no longer in this world.

537
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,130
Kim So-yong died that night

538
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,900
I will never hurt the Queen again.

539
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,140
We have no future.

540
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,620
Because I can't forgive you

541
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm not the real Kim So Yong

542
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,190
so

543
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,700
Can't

544
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,210
How come?

545
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,470
Are you looking for something, madam?

546
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,580
I caused you a lot of trouble last time.

547
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,500
Last time?

548
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,130
In the hospital

549
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,250
that

550
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,400
That... that

551
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,390
It's all my fault for giving you water with poisonous weeds.

552
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,390
So what

553
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,050
Although I slap you and then give you a sweet date

554
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,770
But I feel like you're pretending not to know

555
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,140
Picked it up on the way here

556
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,570
I don't know where to go to find such a beautiful thing.

557
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,340
What is assassination of the Lord?

558
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,330
Why would you do such a big thing without permission?

559
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,180
Encountering this consequence

560
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,800
Mr. Kim Jageun is also

561
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,910
How audacious!

562
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,260
No matter how blinded by money, they actually transferred their weapons.

563
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,110
Do you want to drain the country?

564
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,090
Didn't I clearly say there were no problems?

565
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,820
Use people according to what adults want

566
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,200
Do you think that's enough money?

567
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,700
Now, are you saying that you did this for me?

568
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,130
I just want to see the results instead of the process for adults.

569
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,490
Try your best

570
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,380
For you, my Lord

571
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,290
I did this for my family.

572
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,070
Worst Result

573
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,950
You should be aware of this, right?

574
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,010
If you're given a chance

575
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,160
Is everyone here?

576
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,410
grown ups

577
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,420
The father-in-law has not arrived yet

578
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,340
I didn't call him

579
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:53,280
It is for the sake of the father-in-law that we are all gathered here.

580
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,280
The father-in-law's concern for our family's property

581
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,780
Left an unlucky record

582
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,660
Fortunately,

583
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,360
This record is in my hands.

584
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,090
In my power

585
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,660
This object will have no effect.

586
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
Everyone, rest assured.

587
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,760
but

588
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,760
If I lose my power due to persecution by others

589
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,290
Then it won't be able to protect this object.

590
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,780
As long as you protect me

591
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,610
I will protect you too.

592
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,450
If we protect adults

593
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,410
So what would His Majesty think?

594
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,350
If we just leave it alone and don't push forward

595
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,290
The emperor should have cleared us all out.

596
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,100
There is an opportunity created for the national crisis

597
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,940
Border defense department?

598
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,720
Is there a more dangerous situation than an incompetent king ascending the throne?

599
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,100
All future political decisions

600
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,840
All of this will be achieved through the Border Defense Department

601
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,550
The items are ready

602
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,990
As you explained

603
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,020
Freeze the toxin in the center

604
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,380
When ice melts, the toxins are revealed

605
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
How long does it take until the toxins show up?

606
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,190
Varies depending on weather

607
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:21,650
About a tea time

608
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,450
(One tea hour is about the time it takes to finish a cup of tea)
About a tea time

609
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,480
(One tea hour is about the time it takes to finish a cup of tea)

610
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,980
knew

611
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,600
but

612
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,280
Who is this intended for?

613
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,170
All it takes is for a woman to disappear from the palace.

614
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,300
There will be two people who threaten my position.

615
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,360
Thank you for holding on till now

616
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,830
What kind of mentality did you have to survive in this palace?

617
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,310
I won't forget

618
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,080
Now that the identity has been exposed

619
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,480
It's too dangerous to stay in the palace any longer.

620
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,490
Leave the palace now.

621
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,060
Everyone will become a seed.

622
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,590
Your wishes

623
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,990
It will definitely sprout

624
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,510
Feeling a bit chilly

625
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,160
Who is this guy who can't let go of his obsession?

626
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,890
Here we come

627
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,040
Shaped ice cubes

628
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,570
Put it in the Queen's cold drink?

629
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,700
yes

630
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,670
You just put in ice cubes.

631
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,540
Concubine

632
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,380
I

633
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,240
Brought important information.

634
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,420
Please help me

635
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,710
What exactly is intelligence?

636
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,420
As long as you agree with me to save me

637
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,170
What are you doing now?

638
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,400
Han Shang Gong

639
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,770
You're such a brave kid.

640
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,990
I'm so scared that I tremble

641
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,750
Although I don't know what it is

642
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,140
But I will help you wherever I can.

643
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,270
I

644
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,930
From Master Kim Jageun...

645
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,180
If you like it, you should like it sooner.

646
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,550
Then Jin Zhaorong would not commit suicide

647
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,090
I won't be in this situation anymore.

648
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,310
But more importantly

649
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,340
I have always been proud of myself for having tasted all kinds of flavors in this world.

650
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,010
But I found out so far

651
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,770
The world I know is not all

652
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,110
How can I describe the feeling I had yesterday?

653
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,200
If the world I know is soft bread

654
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,550
This is like

655
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,250
Because it's fresh

656
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,380
I am attracted by the difference

657
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,160
Cheer up Zhang Zhaorong

658
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,590
Now the names are all mixed up.

659
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,400
Really

660
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,330
Niangniang

661
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,220
Come in

662
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,220
The King and the Concubine

663
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,520
Said I want to have brunch with you

664
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,140
What's brunch like now?

665
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,460
I'm not in the mood to play with you now.

666
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,200
The Queen Mother has prepared everything.

667
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,120
Is it enough to just go to Tonghua Temple?

668
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm hungry after jumping around all day.

669
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,990
To remove the nave

670
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,310
The account book finally fell into Jin Zuogen's hands.

671
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,370
Who knew this would be found in the main hall?

672
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,600
How come?

673
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,190
Return to the palace immediately

674
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,250
This side

675
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,240
What are you doing? Hurry up.

676
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,450
oh

677
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,330
He ran away suddenly again.

678
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,550
I am really worried because of Ding Ding

679
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,360
Sincerely feel terrified, Madam

680
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,110
Having brunch under such a beautiful scenery

681
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,810
The party is over

682
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,540
I have a lot of time now

683
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,220
Spend more time like this.

684
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,860
The Queen Mother

685
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,670
Brunch can't miss out on cold drinks

686
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,890
The woman who will die in the palace today

687
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,500
It's the middle temple

688
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,170
The lady finally

689
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,180
Got revenge

690
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,370
Special preparation for today

691
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,870
Ice is more precious than gold

692
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,530
This is the first time I see ice here.

693
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:52,730
Otherwise, the sun is so bright, it's just right for drinking.

694
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,050
Nave please please nave

695
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,370
where you go

696
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,620
Your Majesty has something to say to the Queen Mother

697
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,450
Do you know where this is? Let's go.

698
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,460
There are important things to let go

699
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,650
Tan Yang

700
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,010
Damn

701
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,930
What are you doing? I will be beheaded too.

702
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,350
What is the important thing?

703
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,770
Is she a palace maid you know?

704
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,860
Yes, I'm in the imperial kitchen.

705
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,300
Children often seen

706
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,210
What happened to Tan Yang?

707
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:13,140
That that

708
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,940
sorry

709
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,830
To serve the Queen Mother's meal

710
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,510
It's not for women.

711
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,820
Meeting the Queen Mother for the first time on such an occasion

712
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,550
Please forgive me

713
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,170
I'm honored

714
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,570
How's the discipline of your father that I mentioned?

715
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,590
I will try my best when your highness wakes up.

716
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,850
Drink it before the precious ice melts

717
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,510
How does it taste?

718
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,530
This cool feeling

719
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,260
It's so cool.

720
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,070
nave

721
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,560
Niangniang

722
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,420
How dare you do this now?

723
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,490
Are you okay?

724
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,270
Oh my god

725
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,830
Throwing stones at the nave

726
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,980
I'm fine, ma'am.

727
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,420
Put the maid in jail immediately.

728
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,950
To be punished for disrespect

729
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,120
Niangniang

730
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:07,620
yes

731
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,690
She is my favorite maid.

732
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,810
I'm fine, please calm down.

733
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,870
This is not the temple's problem.

734
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,800
It is to disrupt the order of the women in the inner court.

735
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,960
Ignoring North Korean laws

736
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,630
Just kids

737
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,610
There must be some reason.

738
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,350
That child wouldn't be like this for no reason.

739
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,850
If the central hall continues like this

740
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,030
Charge that child with a heinous crime

741
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,810
Imposing heavier penalties

742
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,430
Why are you rushing here?

743
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,190
Did you know that the child would harm the middle temple?

744
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,440
Do you want to involve me too?

745
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,860
Your Highness's timing of appearance is perfect.

746
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,500
Those who are planning rebellion will dine with the Queen

747
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,720
I came here because I felt uneasy.

748
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,110
A good occasion was ruined

749
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,990
Go to Tongming Palace

750
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,990
The disruptive child will be punished.

751
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,700
Brother, please take responsibility yourself.

752
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,940
Don't bring trouble to your family

753
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,650
What will happen

754
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,460
You wouldn't hit a child that young.

755
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,250
Is the central palace really okay?

756
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,120
Do you have a tingling tongue or a rapid heartbeat?

757
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,970
What are you saying? It sounds like...

758
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,160
Let's change the place first

759
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,130
I want to go to the Great Hall with the Central Hall

760
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,930
It's your highness

761
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,650
All meals and drinks thereafter

762
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,810
Be careful with everything you ingest

763
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,480
Who wants to harm me?

764
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,240
Kim Jo-geun and the Queen

765
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,230
I just wanted to poison you.

766
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,540
I didn't do anything to lie

767
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,580
Are you going to kill me because I helped the party?

768
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,790
The account book was found in the Great Hall

769
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,000
Ledger

770
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,520
Jin Zuogen and his father came to ask

771
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,400
What is an account book?

772
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,660
Wasn't it taken from the main family?

773
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,850
I don't know. I haven't seen it in my home.

774
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,240
I haven't seen it in the Grand Palace.

775
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:04,990
yes

776
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,850
It's not dethronement, it's poisoning

777
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,590
Was it Tan Yang who saved me?

778
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,180
It should be

779
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,860
That drink

780
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,410
But I've drunk a lot.

781
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,440
I'll go ask Tan Yang that kid

782
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,660
I'll go ask Tan Yang in person, will he be okay?

783
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,060
Must be fine

784
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,130
Those who want the life of the middle palace will not give up.

785
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,890
You save him

786
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,210
I will try my best

787
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,350
I didn't do anything wrong

788
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,540
It's not stolen money.

789
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,670
It was to get my brother out of jail.

790
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,450
Earned money for several years

791
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,290
Spare my life if I kill my brother

792
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,640
Letâ€™s talk about this pendant in detail.

793
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,840
Tan Yang

794
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,090
Niangniang

795
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,230
Are you okay, ma'am?

796
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,410
That's what I should be asking.

797
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,350
That's great, ma'am.

798
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,560
Because the ice has not completely melted

799
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,190
Ice cubes?

800
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,010
Escorting the criminals

801
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,730
yes

802
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,310
Escort? Where?

803
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,770
Niangniang

804
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,920
You can't be here

805
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,490
You know the child is innocent.

806
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,750
What do you mean?

807
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,900
If I am guilty, then I have been saved.

808
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,890
I don't know where you heard it though.

809
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,510
Please go back first

810
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,340
What if I say no?

811
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,190
That child will be punished according to the procedure

812
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,600
If you continue to stay here, it will harm you.

813
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,450
Send the Queen to the Dazao Palace

814
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:21,550
Yes Yes

815
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:26,660
Letting go

816
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,190
I will serve you

817
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,370
Please go back quickly

818
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,700
You're causing a commotion.

819
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,980
It doesn't help the child.

820
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:45,530
Niangniang

821
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,290
Tan Yang

822
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,710
The Queen will rescue you immediately.

823
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,080
Don't be too scared

824
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,280
Good lady

825
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,800
Let's go, madam.

826
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,420
I will definitely rescue you.

827
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,250
Just a palace maid

828
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,830
How dare you throw stones at the Queen?

829
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,240
This is disrespectful.

830
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,680
This is not disrespect but rebellion

831
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,370
I heard that her father didn't pay the military camp fee.

832
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,380
And he's a rebellious criminal.

833
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,250
Like father, like daughter.

834
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,980
The ministers' reaction was a bit excessive.

835
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,160
I don't know why she did that.

836
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,040
Now it is those Donghak bandits who believe in Donghak

837
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,440
(The Donghak bandits used the term to describe the bandits as Donghak followers)
Now it is those Donghak bandits who believe in Donghak

838
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:11,480
(The Donghak bandits used the term to describe the bandits as Donghak followers)

839
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,020
The period when the power was growing and threatening the imperial court
(The Donghak bandits used the term to describe the bandits as Donghak followers)

840
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,790
The period when the power was growing and threatening the imperial court

841
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,070
We must rectify discipline and establish the prestige of the court

842
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,460
Did they even link it to the Eastern Bandits?

843
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,550
How dare you throw stones at the Queen?

844
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,770
Definitely a confused mind.

845
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,150
She is just a 5-year-old child.

846
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,930
She actually said she had a confused mind

847
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,240
I am terrified

848
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,040
Your Highness, you were in Ganghwa

849
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,760
You are the one who cleared up the doubts about Donghak.

850
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,380
Is this your new weapon?

851
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,070
If you continue to protect that child and not punish her

852
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,950
We can only think that His Majesty

853
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,360
You also agree with reactionary ideas

854
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,020
This is as long as you investigate the crime of that palace maid.

855
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,160
Things that will end

856
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,820
That's all, right?

857
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,870
The Queen Mother asked us to punish him severely

858
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,570
I am angry because the regime has been taken away from me.

859
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,360
Are you losing your temper?

860
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,750
Just a palace maid

861
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,150
Actually let the nave position

862
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,500
A great opportunity was left unsolved.

863
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,950
Why haven't you come yet?

864
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,390
I think I'm doing a good job.

865
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,830
Longer meetings are usually not a good sign.

866
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,200
Niangniang

867
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,250
Um

868
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,790
The lady is here

869
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,490
Let's all keep this scene in mind.

870
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,950
Maids in the Palace

871
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,450
Can't see or hear

872
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:41,360
Don't have reactionary thoughts.

873
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,430
Dong Xue Ren is Tian

874
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,500
If someone with such restless behavior is caught

875
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,240
That's your fate.

876
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,690
How can a young child...

877
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,070
hush hush

878
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,670
I thought I would catch a big fish.

879
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,330
I didn't expect that Ququ was just a child.

880
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,230
Is it too late?

881
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,800
Now you know how I feel.

882
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,080
It was obviously to save the queen.

883
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,790
That's why I killed her.

884
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,890
Because she got in the way of killing me

885
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,170
What crime has she committed?

886
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,510
Isn't that what you said?

887
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,200
The crimes of those people

888
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,130
It was such a young child who took the blame

889
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,180
Why didn't you save her?

890
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,530
Nothing can be done for the sake of justice

891
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:46,970
Is it righteousness?

892
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,440
Is this child your righteousness?

893
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,620
The world is inherently unfair

894
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,070
Wasn't it you, the middle palace, who said this?

895
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,090
I just make a small sacrifice

896
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,960
Prevented greater sacrifice

897
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,580
A small sacrifice?

898
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,280
Because she is just the weakest

899
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,800
And the reason is that the girl is young?

900
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,750
Incompetence is a sin

901
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,090
Can't even protect such a young child.

902
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,310
It is sin

903
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:50,670
How do we create a signal that only we know?

904
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,490
Like this

905
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,930
Everything I say now is a lie

906
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,500
That's what I mean

907
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:08,690
(Preview of the next episode)

908
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,230
Start Today

909
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,170
This crazy woman in the palace is me

910
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,680
Who did you offend?

911
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,910
I'll let you know clearly

912
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,920
Are you planning to kill the Queen?

913
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,670
I...

914
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,240
Put it all in

915
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,880
Kim Byung-in is not only afraid of that

916
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,800
Alliance with me

917
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,740
From now on, the middle temple and I are no longer in touch.

918
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,330
Don't mess with your heart.

919
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,370
It can be said to be exploration and testing.

920
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,660
Do you want to finish your ramen before leaving?
