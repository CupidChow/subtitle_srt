00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,110
   

3
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,860
   

4
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,220
Congratulations!

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,720
You've done well, My Queen.

6
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,800
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm going to be a father!

8
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,390
I'm... pregnant?

9
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,650
Freeze right there!

10
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,660
Get out! Get out!

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,620
Why is the queen so mad?

12
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,450
I don't think she's being angry, this might be her expression of happiness.

13
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,420
Y-Yes.

14
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,820
Is it... some sort of pregnancy syndrome?

15
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,020
This isn't just a crisis of my (sexual) identity.

16
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,590
This is the extinction of my identity, destruction of my soul!

17
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,820
Is my life over in this way now?

18
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,530
I told you! I've chosen to be single for my life to begin with.

19
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,320
Even if I happened to marry by accident, I was never going to have a baby.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,520
It's hard enough for me to survive here in this battlefield-life, but a child!

21
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,990
It's as hopeless as taking off a bulletproof vest and dancing the samba in a rain of bullets!

22
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,930
That's not all. Pregnancy and giving birth is a terrible process to shorten your lifespan.

23
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,890
Well, it's basically me grinding my own life away to give birth to a child.

24
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,470
Why should I give my precious life to a baby I don't even know anything about?

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,720
Damnable Mother Nature.  F*** the provision of Nature!

26
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,900
What do you mean I'm pregnant!

27
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,430
   

28
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,960
  Please wait for a second. 

29
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,150
   

30
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,370
I know you fabricated the corpse.

31
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,640
Did you think I wouldn't recognize Oh Wol until the end?

32
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,600
I did it just to enlighten you, Eui Bin.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,390
To show your true self that you didn't even know yet, I mean.

34
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,620
The queen turned her back to the Ansong Kim Family.

35
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,000
Instead, the Ansong Kim Family joined hands with our clan.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,570
This is the golden opportunity for you to ascend to the seat of queen.

37
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't you ever try to control me.

38
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:47,490
The bird is already tamed by humans, so how many days will it survive if it leaves its cage?

39
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,880
There is news that His Majesty the King has ordered to officially announce to the world.

40
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,030
What's the news?

41
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,760
The queen is pregnant.

42
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,370
That's the sound of the drum which announces a big happy occasion.

43
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,770
 As my storage rooms are completely empty,  

44
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,500
 there is no way to fill the emptiness in my mind.  

45
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,100
 My stomach, no, my mind which can't be filled with even various delicacies.  

46
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,800
 What can I fill it with? 

47
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,970
 I, who even turned his back to his own clan,  

48
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,240
 am now a loner. 

49
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,830
 My Lord! 

50
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,640
My Lord... My Lord!

51
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,840
- What? 
 - There is urgent news from the palace!

52
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,630
Is it...

53
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,560
Did something happen to the queen?

54
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,760
The queen... is pregnant!

55
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,470
What is the reason?

56
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,350
Your Majesty, I think instead of looking for the reason,

57
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,750
lifting her spirits may be more effective.

58
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,570
Good idea, but what would that be? A way to make a woman feel better?

59
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,010
I just asked something you wouldn't know.

60
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,660
Who should I ask then?

61
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,040
So I came here and brought along a specialist for you, Cheoljong.

62
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,040
Since this man has been agonizing over that question all the time lately.

63
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,220
What are you doing!

64
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,810
Then the person would probably turn angry just like that.

65
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,650
That's when you say it.

66
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,350
"I just gave water to the flower."

67
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,250
It might be hard for me to come out alive if I did that.

68
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,550
She has an attitude, I see.

69
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,630
Then, there is a sure way.

70
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,790
What's that?

71
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,380
You make a funny face like this.

72
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,080
Now I'm disgusted with myself that I had the same idea as this man.

73
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,190
It certainly helped.

75
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,040
- Impossible! 
 - It made me realize how foolish I was, asking other people how to solve this problem.

76
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,620
When I'm the one who knows that woman the best.

77
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,110
Why are you crying? I should be the one crying.

78
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,390
Because I'm so happy.

79
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,810
Your Majesty, at least for today, please cry as much as you want.

80
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Okay, cry, whatever.

81
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,960
You can cry a lot instead of me.

82
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,640
For the life...

83
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,960
I never chose.

84
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,410
Your Majesty,

85
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,640
you shouldn't be crying any more tears of joy.

86
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
Then, what should I be doing?

87
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,130
You should pay a visit to the elders of the Inner Court so that you can relay this good news and get their congratulations.

88
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,770
I don't want to! I tore (broke) ties with my in-laws.

89
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,620
Regardless if you tore it or sewed it, if you don't follow protocol, you will get in big trouble, Your Majesty.

90
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm hating being pregnant more and more.

91
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,290
 Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager is here. 

92
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,470
 Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager is here, too. 

93
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,170
We've lost the chance to initiate it.

94
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,750
What do we do?

95
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,080
You came?

96
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,570
I was supposed to go to your rooms and give you the news directly.

97
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,000
But as you can see, it's hard for me to walk.

98
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,860
What did you say the symptoms were?

99
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,130
It's extreme vertigo, caused by morning sickness and aches from pregnancy.

100
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,920
Yes, those.

101
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,540
So I came here myself.

102
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,960
Please sit...

103
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,330
right here.

104
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,770
That's all right.

105
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,040
Your body must feel heavy, so just stay comfortably, right there.

106
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,690
Yes, well then...

107
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,840
How happy I was when I heard the news!

108
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,180
I even got that talisman, which I haven't gotten for a while.

109
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,920
The present is because I wish your child to be born safely.

110
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,400
 Well, this looks like a talisman curse, though. 

111
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,060
Sorry, but since I'm an atheist, I don't believe in things like this.

112
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,150
When your child is born, you will know

113
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,690
the feeling that you'll want to believe things that you didn't before.

114
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,730
Like you'll want to wish on a rock on the street,

115
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,090
being of such a desperate mind, I mean.

116
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,860
Even you, the fearless queen,

117
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,280
will now fear everything in the world.

118
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,800
Losing a child is the mother's fault.

119
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,490
So I ordered the royal physician to prepare some healthy medicine to prevent miscarriage.

120
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,190
Please drink it every day without missing a day.

121
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,870
If there is anything wrong with the child, you will have to take full responsibility.

122
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,750
So you shouldn't act rashly, but be careful with every action for the royal baby you're carrying.

123
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:47,050
 Coming here together as a pair just to threaten me. Ugh, I feel like I'm actually going to throw up. 

124
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,070
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Highnesses.

125
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,460
 This is Prince Yeongpyeong. 

126
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,190
Please come in.

127
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,990
You came because you were worried about me, didn't you?

128
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,340
It's fine.

129
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,940
But I might not be able to congratulate the king and queen,

130
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,950
I have to follow my own path.

131
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,790
I came here to give strength to the king.

132
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,290
I considered the strength I could give to the king was just psychological support,

133
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,800
but looking at the queen, it doesn't seem to be necessary.

134
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,830
 This is the golden opportunity for you to ascend to the seat of queen. 

135
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,380
Your Highness the Queen Dowager what do I owe you for this honor?

136
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,900
Lady Eui Bin, what brings you here?

137
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,530
I see you joined hands with the Ansong Kim Family.

138
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,260
It's a decision made by our clan.

139
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,300
Don't you dare use the name of our clan for this unjustifiable fight.

140
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,320
Do you want to keep your position of Right State Minister?

141
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,090
You'd better make the right choice. Otherwise,

142
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm going to gather all the power from the members of our family including my father,

143
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,710
who are sincerely concerned about the future of Joseon.

144
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,320
Did Father really give me all of this?

145
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,610
Yes, Your Majesty.  All of them are presents for the royal baby you're carrying.

146
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,090
This isn't even all of it. There's tons more in the hallway.

147
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Looking at this, I feel even worse.

148
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,050
I'll light the room now because it's getting dark.

149
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,470
That tiny candle won't really help, because now, my life

150
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,040
is just sheer darkness.

151
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,940
   

152
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,670
Again this time, they beheaded only the clerks, but not the magistrates?

153
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,290
Not beheading the magistrates must mean that they're trying to avoid committing treason toward the king.

154
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,250
How little the courage of mere farmers is, eh?

155
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,120
But this is a headache as they don't give us the excuse to mobilize troops on a large scale.

156
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,230
By the way, were the coded words of Donghak previously found within the palace?  (Donghak - Neo-Confucianism Reformer) 

157
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,030
   

158
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,940
It's big trouble that the Donghak influence has even seeped into the palace, so shouldn't you hurry?

159
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,820
If we just let it be and if a bunch of Donghak followers are found inside the palace, what are you going to do then?

160
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
Just do your own job properly.

161
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,020
   

162
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,280
Your Majesty, starting today,

163
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,580
   
   

164
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,550
You will start prenatal care.

165
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,520
â™«   Bonghwan-ah  â™«

166
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,760
â™«   Bonghwan-ah  â™«

167
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,180
You must not lie down horizontally or lean on your arms

168
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,230
You should not lie down with your neck raised as well.

169
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,520
â™«  I used to not be afraid of the world  â™«

170
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,840
â™«  Even I who is free and has no fears  â™«

171
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,490
â™«  How did I get stuck in this body?  â™«

172
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,050
â™«  What exactly am I supposed to do now?  â™«

173
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,340
â™«  How complicated this is!   â™«

174
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,750
You can't laugh, be surprised, be scared,

175
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,760
mourn, cry, or talk a lot as well.

176
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,760
â™«  One night, two nights pass but the world is still the same  â™«

177
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Unconventional foods should absolutely not be eaten.

178
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,140
This is completely making it so that my body isn't my own!

179
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,960
Well, obviously it's not my body, but I was adjusting pretty well!

180
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,650
How is it that with pregnancy everything is reset!

181
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,630
Especially you!  You said that you wouldn't nag me about certain things anymore!

182
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,010
This is for the child.

183
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,060
I have to live in order for the baby to live as well. Am I just some baby laying machine? A baby incubator?

184
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,240
Also, is prenatal care just for the mother? What is the baby daddy doing! Tell Cheoljong to do some prenatal care!

185
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,730
It just so happens that the prenatal booklet's first page, third line,

186
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,200
states that fathers are responsible for prenatal care, too.

187
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,020
So, tonight, when the king comes back from work, the two of you can do prenatal care together.

188
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,280
From the moment I wake up until I go to sleep, I have to do prenatal care?

189
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,170
My life has gone already.

190
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,700
No, you must not... No, no, no, no.

191
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,200
Take it away, Hong Yeon.

192
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,710
While I was working here, there has been no contact between the queen and Kim Byeong-In lately.

193
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,580
After being thrown out and even hearing the news about the pregnancy,

194
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,920
he must not have any place left to lean on.

195
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,580
How pitiful.

196
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,030
Have you eaten?

197
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,960
Please go inside.

198
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,660
Sleep at home.

199
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,790
Your face looks unwell.

200
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,840
Stress is the source of all illnesses so if I just let this be, it's very bad for prenatal care.

201
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,680
Stand guard.

202
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,760
Just one spoonful.

203
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,930
My Yihwaju!

204
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,800
Head Royal Chef!

205
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,310
My Yihwaju.

206
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,840
It was spoiled so I threw it all out.

207
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,770
You seem to be in a good mood.

208
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,100
I am the same as usual.

209
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,320
You said you lost laughter a long time ago.

210
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,700
I found it... laughter.

211
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,490
I lost Yihwaju and you found laughter.

212
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,230
What a coincidence.

213
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,020
Tell me the truth, Lady Choi.  You are enjoying it right now, aren't you?

214
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,020
You are taking your revenge out on me now for giving you a hard time, aren't you?!

215
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,710
You probably shouldn't shake me, Your Majesty.

216
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,340
Vomit it out.  Vomit out my Yihwaju!

217
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,820
Please, Your Majesty!

218
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,540
Use words, Your Majesty.

219
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,000
Words!

220
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,350
My Yihwaju.

221
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,420
Ah, you drank up all my Yihwaju.

222
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,800
Your Majesty!

223
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,670
I am so annoyed!  My Yihwaju!

224
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,020
Your Majesty.

225
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,640
Why am I crying?

226
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,240
I was waiting for you.

227
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,540
Wow, you look good, like a prince on a white horse.

228
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,550
I canâ€™t do anything, but you're happily riding a horse.

229
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,330
You're still angry today. That's a relief.

230
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,520
Let's ride together.

231
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,840
You cannot, Your Majesty!

232
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,160
The queen is expecting a  baby.

233
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,460
She must not ride, Your Majesty!

234
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,730
Your Royal Highness!

235
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,180
It's dangerous!

236
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,980
Your Royal Highness!

237
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,010
â™«  The heart-throbbing words to me, warmly like the sunshine  â™«

238
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:31,120
â™«  When they brush the tip of my nose, it flutters me somehow  â™«

239
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,080
â™«  Not to get caught with my mind  â™«

240
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,430
Where are we?

241
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,880
I wanted to give you something you liked and wanted the most.

242
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,800
- Something that only exists outside the palace. 
 - Oh?

243
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,010
Freedom is what I'm talking about.

244
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,120
Don't you like it?

245
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,190
You could have told me we just came out for some fresh air instead of making such a big deal.

246
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,980
We came to get some fresh air at the royal family's hermitage.  (Private retreat) 

247
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,410
If you don't like it, we can go back.

248
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,030
Is it a villa or something like that?

249
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,210
It's nice!  It kind of feels like a chaebol CEO is hitting on me. 
   (Chaebol - typically a large family-owned business group) 

250
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,070
Since we are here, we might as well take a look around.

251
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,420
Oh, then let's take a look. This way.

252
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,010
Wow!  It is good to be a king.

253
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,860
This grand villa and a garden...

254
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,760
I was thinking all night, why my queen would be so angry.

255
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,650
For most women in the palace, pregnancy is a blessing.

256
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,670
Why does pregnancy so bother My Queen?

257
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,790
And so, did you figure out the reason?

258
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,310
No. No matter how much I think about it, I donâ€™t know.

259
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,270
I donâ€™t understand, but I just decided to accept it.

260
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,840
What is a blessing to others, may not be a blessing to My Queen.

261
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,490
My Queen is this kind of person.

262
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,320
The Queenâ€™s Dictionary was not in vain.

263
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,570
What's wrong with you? It's making me feel awkward.

264
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,660
My Queen.

265
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,610
Is this a roar?

266
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,670
As the writer of the Queenâ€™s Dictionary, I have a question.

267
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,660
- What does "all-in" mean? 
 - Did I say that?

268
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,670
You were shouting it at the top of your lungs at the market gambling board.

269
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,950
Ah, "all-in" means

270
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,760
putting all your fragile eggs in one basket.

271
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,700
A very foolish act.

272
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,910
- Eggs? 
 - I did that, that foolish act.

273
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,540
Ah, while I am at my prime and should be running full force,

274
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,810
I tripped over a rock called "pregnancy."

275
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,380
Please don't worry, My Queen.

276
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,300
I will surely cut out the rotten part of Joseon.

277
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,130
Even if it's for our child who will inherit this country.

278
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,520
All right.

279
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,990
If this child becomes the king and inherits this country,

280
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,220
 then I am... someone with omnipresent power? 

281
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,510
   to   

282
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,080
Why did I only think of that now?

283
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,790
- Think of what? 
 - My child, look!

284
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,600
Everything under the sky...

285
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,680
is yours!

286
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,920
- Let's go back.  From now on, we are starting real prenatal care. 
 - Real prenatal care?

287
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,700
We will have to teach him how to win by fighting.

288
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,480
This child will have to live in this battlefield-like palace.  Let's go.  Start the engine!

289
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,600
But we just got here...

290
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,880
Even if I use 100 Queen's Dictionaries,

291
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,840
will I really be able to understand the queen?

292
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,990
- Wait for me. Wait for me. 
   - Hurry up! 

293
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,230
   

294
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,880
   

295
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,470
 My child, in order to survive in the palace, 

296
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,130
 you must not be lazy about getting people on your side. 

297
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,510
 Wow! 

298
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,300
As expected, the best warriors in Joseon.

299
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,200
 My child, you must keep your enemies close. 

300
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,950
1,000 soldiers?

301
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,020
By raising that kind of military power, are you planning on pushing your way into the Royal Secretariat or something?

302
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,180
Are you afraid?

303
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,500
It seems that you are the one preparing an army of 1,000 soldiers because you are afraid of me.

304
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,020
Why don't you cut that number in half and re-direct the rest to the Royal Guard?

305
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,420
 My child, you must also make sure to have money on the side. 

306
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,750
- This is the new coin we are pushing forward. 
 - How much?

307
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,450
One million nyang.

308
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,580
Oh... so this is the king's political fund.

309
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,720
 With money, you can even buy power. 

310
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,690
 Lastly, my child, this is the most important thing. 

311
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,190
 Those who are not on your side, get rid of them all. 

312
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,510
 Life is the actual fight and the world is a jungle. 

313
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,350
 Eat or be eaten, that's the law of nature!  Battle of blood!  Slaughter party! 

314
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,630
 Of course, try to achieve peace. But if it looks hopeless, 

315
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,800
 you must use any and all means to win, my child. 

316
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,890
Your Majesty, it is so fortunate that you pulled yourself together.

317
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,670
Is there that much to say even while the child is in the womb?

318
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:44,740
The child might listen to me while in the womb, but probably not after birth.

319
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,620
Now, it's time for sleep.

320
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,750
There is no time to sleep.  I have so much to do.

321
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,440
Life is a running machine.

322
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,920
If you stop even for a moment, you'll get thrown off.

323
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,900
Even pregnancy can't conquer me.

324
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,330
Ah, I am being conquered.

325
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,990
My mind is a motorboat, but my body is a paddleboat.

326
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,790
It's been a while. You've been through a lot.

327
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,630
It's nothing.

328
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,110
I see that you completed the Byeongseo. 
  (Training book about the army and its soldiers) 

329
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,540
It won't be easy to turn these men, who have never held a weapon

330
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,470
into soldiers, but it should help.

331
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,170
Be careful.

332
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,550
I see that the number of followers

333
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,710
have increased that much.

334
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,580
That means there are many who are suffering from oppression.

335
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,470
Recently, from noblemen in ruin to drunkards,

336
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,450
various people are gathering.

337
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,290
Perhaps, as the queen has said,

338
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,560
would abolishing the caste system of nobles and commoners be the answer?

339
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,360
We need to also be cautious of

340
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,050
an ideology that is too radical.

341
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,710
Of course, I am talking about far in the future.

342
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,880
I can't achieve it but perhaps

343
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,640
my child can.

344
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,890
Your Majesty, the king has arrivedâ€”

345
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,240
Don't wake her.

346
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,580
She is like a baby.

347
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,480
   

348
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,500
   

349
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,690
   

350
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,890
Pahtee (Party)?

351
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,470
Pah...

352
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,260
Tee is the problem...

353
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,300
Pahtee.

354
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,730
The queen is all right so you did not get in trouble either.

355
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,620
As expected, the talisman I wrote worked.

356
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,890
Your grace is immeasurable.

357
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,480
So...

358
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,560
I take it that you delivered it well, the rumor that I told you?

359
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,150
How diligent you are so early in the morning.

360
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,990
Why don't you at least get rid of eye boogers before gossiping?

361
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,410
Why don't you listen, too?

362
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,230
It will wake you up instantly.

363
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,040
They say that Her Majesty the Queen...

364
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,200
I heard that's what happened.

365
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,240
What?!  His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen faked their night together!

366
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,860
His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen

367
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,550
had a fake night together, I heard.

368
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,690
 In reality, they did not spend the night together, right? 

369
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,440
 I heard that they just sleep in the same room, right? 

370
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,240
Then, the pregnancy is by whom?

371
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,460
If it's not His Majesty, then whose child is it?

372
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,700
No way...  Then, a fake...

373
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,810
I see that you heard it as well, the rumor that's spreading inside the palace.

374
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,330
Rumors always rush around belatedly.

375
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,280
They're so behind.

376
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,630
In the palace, rumors should not be taken lightly.

377
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,830
They could use that as an issue to dethrone you.

378
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,960
Seriously! Always trying to dethrone me over anything!

379
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,160
It's so petty and tacky,

380
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,130
Iâ€™ll never let them kick me out.

381
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,320
- Yes. 
 - Hong Yeon!

382
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,560
What are you doing with your hairpin?

383
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,460
What's wrong with you?  Are you not ashamed of this pose?

384
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,670
We must hush up the rumor.

385
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,530
- Oh my goodness! 
 - Oh my gosh! 
 - I'm so ashamed.

386
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,440
Oh, in that case...

387
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,740
Would this be enough to hush up that rumor?

388
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,420
We need to do at least this much.

389
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,020
This is a bit excessive.

390
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,510
Though, it's nowhere near as excessive as me.

391
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,580
It's not enough.

392
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,120
Letâ€™s put a little more soul into this.

393
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,380
If I put more soul into this...

394
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,900
We shall need a tent.

395
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,110
Is that what you want?

396
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,680
Who said I wanted to? No, it's just necessary for our public image.

397
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,420
Well, since it's necessary for our public image,

398
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,320
I'll come to Daejojeon Hall tonight.

399
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,820
Since there's the risk of dethronement, I guess you must.

400
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,160
Then...

401
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,810
See you a little later to do that.

402
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,630
Did they leave?

403
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,810
They are so slow. We need to stay this way longer.

404
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,190
Then it can't be helped.

405
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,190
Your Highness, Lady Eui Bin is here.

406
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,360
Queen Dowager, is it your doing?

407
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,760
What are you talking about?

408
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,100
The rumor.

409
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,770
It is, all thanks to you.

410
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,780
I remembered what you told me some time ago.

411
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,300
That the queen told you she lied about spending the night with the king.

412
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,990
With this, the queenâ€™s pregnancy will be unwelcome.

413
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,170
The words you uttered...

414
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,050
ended up becoming an arrow and shot the queen.

415
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,710
Stop, please!

416
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,270
I can't do anything anymore now.

417
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,880
Once rumors start,

418
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,270
there's no turning back.

419
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,030
You, also,

420
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,540
cannot try to get out of it now.

421
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,140
As long as youâ€™re in the palace,

422
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,180
you'll not be free.

423
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:01,640
Your existence itself will be used for the needs of our family.

424
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,880
Take the lead rather than being used.

425
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm scared.

426
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,170
I'm sure.

427
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,410
But you are not alone.

428
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,650
Don't worry.

429
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,860
That I'm starting to become like you...

430
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,040
scares me.

431
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,590
Do you know the reason why our family obeys you?

432
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,700
Because you're a victim who was drowned in sorrow after losing her child.

433
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,560
But if you were a heartless mother who heartlessly caused her son's death in order to save herself;

434
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,060
and furthermore, if she's foolish enough to be bemused by all kinds of superstition,

435
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,180
relying on the words of Bodhisattva for her clan's fate,

436
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,210
will they still consider you the head of our family?

437
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,320
I will make sure to write down everything I have heard and seen in this palace,

438
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,850
so that every person in Joseon will know.

439
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,530
How much weight do you think those trivial matters hold?

440
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,410
You will find out... soon enough.

441
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,710
You told me once that you don't want to regret it again.

442
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,890
What you need to regret is not your failure to prevent the death of the late king,

443
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,250
but stepping on his dreams.

444
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,440
For breaking your sonâ€™s wings with your own hands,

445
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,350
regret that instead.

446
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,370
What the late king wanted so desperately to escape from was probably

447
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,160
coming out from under his mother's shadow.

448
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,060
You don't know anything!

449
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,070
How dare you say such nonsense?

450
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,820
It's the truth everyone knows.

451
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,960
Actually, you know it too.

452
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,530
I wonâ€™t let you trample on His Majesty's dreams.

453
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,650
That wench!

454
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,020
I'm going to Daejojeon Hall.

455
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,740
Yes.

456
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,820
You know they say that rumors and dreams are opposites.

457
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,360
Rumors, too?

458
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,420
I didn't tell people about the night spent with the king because it was personal.

459
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,910
Since, if you knew, you all would be really shocked.

460
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,160
During the night...

461
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,540
 Goodness! 

462
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:16,660
It's not like I can tell people about that fiery night.

463
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,340
The king is different from what I thought.

464
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,740
He's a great king who will go down in history.

465
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,840
 No way... Was it recorded that way in history because of me? 

466
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,800
Who would spread such a rumor?

467
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,450
The only person who would do something like that is Lady Eui Bin.

468
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,890
It's okay. It's okay.

469
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,600
What? What are you here to complain about now?

470
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,800
Are you confident?

471
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:16,170
Are you confident you and the king will win?

472
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,820
This is my fight as well. I also have a reason I need to win.

473
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,220
If that's the case then practice some archery, too.

474
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,610
With those skills, you'll be more of a burden than a help.

475
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,590
Then why don't you teach me, Eui Bin?

476
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:52,820
I don't have the time to do that.

477
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,670
Your Majesty, Lady Eui Bin is here.

478
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,720
Let her in.

479
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,300
- I have a request for you, My King. 
 - Tell me.

480
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,450
You must grant it no matter what.

481
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,300
What is it?

482
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,680
Let me leave the palace.

483
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,810
What do you mean by that?

484
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,940
I can't find myself in this palace.

485
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,490
Please throw me out so that I can live as myself.

486
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,170
I cannot. You know full well what living as a Bin who was thrown out means.

487
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:56,290
I don't care about what others think. No, I won't be swayed by them.

488
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,780
Since it is my last request, so please fulfill it for me.

489
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,980
I will not agree to it. I cannot!

490
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:17,110
Your Majesty, you and I cherish each other but are no longer in love.

491
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:25,430
I am now just someone who's living locked up in the palace under the name, Bin.

492
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,600
Your Majesty, all the ministers are present.

493
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,800
The reason I called you all here today,

494
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,360
is to relay an important decision I made.

495
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,730
As of now, I am removing Jo Hwa-jin

496
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,560
from the senior rank 1 of Eui Bin.

497
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,650
 What's happened? 

498
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,540
Shouldn't we stop him?

499
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,400
Eui Bin is no longer our person.

500
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:13,660
Your Majesty, please be healthy. I will be praying for your future.

501
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,070
My Lady!

502
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,480
Don't call me that from now on.

503
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,050
It can't be like this.

504
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,960
- The king shouldn't have done this. 
 - I asked him to.

505
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,750
- Why? 
 - This is best for everyone.

506
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:00,830
As long as I'm in the palace, I will be forced to block the king's path against my will.

507
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:08,730
I will make sure that doesn't happen. We can still fix this. I will tell the king immediatelyâ€”

508
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:17,920
I don't trust myself anymore. If I continue to stay here, I might lose myself completely.

509
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,550
I... even ignored your feelings.... when I knew how you felt all along.

510
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,910
- My Lady. 
 - I used your feelings.

511
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:40,010
The emptiness I felt caused by His Majesty not looking at me the same way I looked at him,

512
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,330
I filled it with you.

513
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,480
I let you use me.

514
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,580
Since that's all... I could offer you.

515
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:04,550
Thank you for everything and I'm sorry.

516
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:10,780
Now, you should also let go of a love that is not right for you.

517
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,490
So that's what she meant.

518
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,750
She's a cool woman.

519
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,720
Is Cheoljong okay?

520
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,360
He probably isn't.

521
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,450
Why don't you spar with me once?

522
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,920
I am not in the mood.

523
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,120
When we were young... there was a game we used to play often in Ganghwa.

524
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:28,680
The one who steps on the other's shadow first is the winner.  If you really don't feel like doing it...

525
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,980
you just have to lose.

526
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,170
Do you remember?

527
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,330
When we were young, I always won.

528
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,780
I do remember that I always won later on but...

529
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,600
I should have firmly set the pecking order earlier.

530
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,740
It's not that you didn't set the pecking order, but rather you couldn't.

531
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,980
Lady Eui Bin, till the very end, cared for you and worried about you.

532
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,350
For His Majesty who does not even know the value of her feelingsâ€”

533
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,690
I do know!  That's why I am in pain!

534
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,250
You must be in more pain.

535
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,570
That's the least you should do to set things right with Eui Bin.

536
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:10,000
How much lonelier do I need to feel and how much more pain do I need to be in!  How much more!

537
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,770
Our Jong, is he somewhere drinking?

538
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,050
I would drink with him if it weren't for the pregnancy.

539
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,720
Ah, does pregnancy mean becoming a newborn not giving birth to a newborn?

540
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,200
Why am I always sleepy?

541
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,390
I will go to Tongmyeonjeon.

542
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,310
You should be careful!  Since it is a dangerous rumor...

543
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,870
If it is revealed that the rumor originated from you...

544
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,360
Before Grand Queen Dowager hears the rumor,

545
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,190
I have to relay it myself.

546
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,030
- Butâ€” 
 - Don't worry, Lady Ahn.

547
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:21,670
She won't even think that I would spread the rumor and tell it to her myself.

548
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,570
I didn't even summon you yet you came to visit me.  You must have a favor to ask me.

549
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:35,540
I was worried that you would be so surprised to hear such a shocking rumor,

550
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,750
so I came here right away.

551
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,300
Rumor?

552
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,440
How is it that you chase after every pathetic little thing?

553
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,310
When you hear it, you won't be able to say that so easily.

554
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:56,330
I am curious though as to what kind of rumor made you come running to me so excitedly.

555
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:59,470
It would be a shame for me to miss

556
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:04,050
your facial expression upon hearing this rumor.

557
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,940
It would be difficult to see the facial expression you hope to see with just any rumor.

558
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:18,130
The child in the queen's womb is not a royal descendant.

559
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,750
It is the seed of Kim Byeong-in.

560
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,330
You cherished your family so much,

561
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,940
yet the Ansong Kim family will now be recorded in history

562
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,150
as the family that tainted the royal bloodline.

563
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,080
That is interesting.  It has become very interesting.

564
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,080
Hey, did you hear that rumor?

565
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,560
I already heard the groundless rumor.

566
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,720
His Majesty and Her Majesty reallyâ€”

567
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,140
I heard they really and surely bedded together.  Fussing around belatedly...

568
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:18,360
That's not it.  I heard that the child is not His Majesty's.

569
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,610
You'll get in trouble for saying such things!

570
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:33,660
The entire palace is laughing at our family.

571
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,010
Her Majesty and the Minister of Defense are close relatives and... adulterous?

572
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:43,400
I had such high expectations for the Minister of Defense...

573
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,870
I thought it was over after Eui Bin was removed from her position.

574
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:52,450
But hearing the news about the queen makes me feel like we've won.

575
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,870
Instead of being a royal descendant, it was a cuckoo chick. 
  (T/N: Cuckoos are known to lay eggs in the nests of other birds.) 

576
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,680
For me, my family is more important than my life.

577
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,680
Therefore, I live for my family.  What do you live for?

578
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,320
I, too, am the same as Your Highness.

579
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,670
Is that so?

580
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:39,240
Then, are you willing to do anything for the family?

581
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,790
Yes.

582
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,340
Then, bring the queen's head to me right now.

583
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,730
It is the family's order.

584
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,880
What in the world is the reason?

585
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,630
The queen completely destroyed our family's honor that we've built up for centuries.

586
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:03,170
Grand Queen Dowager, I do not know what made you so upset but I ask for leniency.

587
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,820
Everyone in the palace was talking about how the king and queen do not actually spend nights together.

588
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,430
Now, they are saying that the child she's carrying is yours!

589
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,970
That... That is not true!

590
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,870
If everyone believes it, then it is the truth.

591
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,700
When day breaks and the rumor spreads all over,

592
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,730
the queen will be a sinner who became pregnant through adultery, then she lied about the fact,

593
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,980
and is trying to taint the royal bloodline.

594
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,800
The rumor started because of me.  I will take the punishment.

595
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,290
If a man gets hurt by a rumor, a woman dies by a rumor.

596
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,880
What is needed to restore the family's honor is the queen's head.

597
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,240
If you personally bring me the queen's head,

598
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,410
I will overlook your sin.

599
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,830
I cannot do that.  Please punish me instead!

600
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,850
You said you live for the family but you live only for the queen, is that right?!

601
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,080
Then, I will just have to have someone else do it.  Come in!

602
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,170
Immediately!

603
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,680
I will re-new the regency for you.

604
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,320
It seems that you got close to something dangerous.

605
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,410
On the book that has the queen's name written on it,

606
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,940
there is a Donghak code written in your handwriting.

607
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,710
A dangerous ideology has seeped into even the king and queen

608
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,020
causing them to try and overturn the country.

609
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,540
If this kind of danger is felt by those in power, what do you think will happen?

610
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,950
They will try to keep the current Joseon even if it meant killing half the people of this country, will they not?

611
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:19,420
A massacre of Donghak followers on a grand scale will start.

612
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:25,590
Then, why did you come to me instead of starting it right away?

613
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,140
Because Her Majesty will also get hurt.

614
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,450
But the Ansong Kim Family

615
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,480
made Her Majesty their target.

616
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,550
Using the rumor that she's pregnant from an adulterous relationship with me,

617
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,780
they are trying to kill Her Majesty's honor.

618
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,650
Since it is to attack me,  I will stop it.

619
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,230
You cannot stop it!

620
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,690
Even if you can get her life spared for now,

621
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:03,820
if the family attacks Her Majesty by entangling her in an ugly rumor,

622
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,370
Her Majesty's life will no longer be that of a living person.

623
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,130
Not only Her Majesty, but it will be the same for the royal descendant who is to be born.

624
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,910
Don't you know how the ministers, who are bent on shaking your position,

625
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:21,220
will torment Her Majesty!

626
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:29,550
Only you can save Her Majesty.

627
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:34,260
What is it?  How can I save the queen?

628
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,000
Go and put an end to the uprising.

629
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:43,470
You need to personally punish the Donghak followers.

630
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:47,660
Going after the king's woman while the king is out fighting to protect the country

631
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,620
is not righteous so the rumor will lose its power.

632
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,250
Also, by personally punishing the Donghak followers and proving that you are not connected,

633
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,990
then the code in the Dongmongseonseub will no longer be a threat.   (Children's practice (text) book in Joseon) 

634
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,790
This is...

635
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,630
the only way to save

636
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,140
Her Majesty and your child that she is carrying.

637
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:21,270
You don't have time to hesitate.  When day breaks, Her Majesty will be swallowed up by the rumor.

638
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,060
I will never...

639
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,720
let Her Majesty get hurt by herself.

640
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:59,040
â™«  Like the faded moonlight  â™«

641
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,350
I'm not sleeping.

642
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,150
I'm just thinking for a bit.

643
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,190
You should lie down so youâ€™re comfortable. Why are you doing this?

644
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,110
I came to comfort you.

645
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,720
â™«  Your soft heart   â™«

646
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:17,410
I've been lost in deep thought.

647
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,090
I'm so sleepy.

648
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,500
I'll comfort you tomorrow.

649
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,820
â™«  The darkness comes in the sky I was watching   â™«

650
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:31,230
â™«  And at the moment your beautiful face is also soaked in   â™«

651
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,630
You've already consoled me.

652
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:41,450
â™«  The stars sparkling in your eyes   â™«

653
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:46,360
â™«  Fell into my heart too   â™«

654
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,280
â™«  It hurt so much   â™«

655
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:57,000
â™«  Even the heart collapsing endlessly   â™«

656
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,790
â™«  I want to embrace all of them   â™«

657
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:05,750
â™«  Instead of the sorrow in your eyes   â™«

658
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:11,390
â™«  I want to put me in them   â™«

659
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:16,480
â™«  Wish you look back, please   â™«

660
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:38,690
The Samnam area has been swept by a rebellion so I am leaving in such a hurry.

661
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:42,540
While I am away, I request that you take care of state affairs.

662
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,470
Also,

663
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:54,460
I trust that you will take care of our child as well.

664
01:02:54,460 --> 01:03:01,010
Although I was getting used to letting go of state affairs, I guess I must.

665
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,620
Don't worry about the queen and go.

666
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,750
Her husband is going to the battlefield and risking his life,

667
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:12,080
it is a definite duty to take care of a woman left alone.

668
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,820
I will trust in those words and leave.

669
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,340
Be careful.

670
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,130
It has already gotten light outside.

671
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,650
Your Majesty.

672
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,680
I'll do the rest.

673
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,630
Your Majesty.

674
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,180
Is it true that you are going to subdue the rebellion by yourself?

675
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,190
It is true.

676
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,710
What's going on?

677
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:19,520
The people you were supporting, you're going to harm?

678
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Kim Byeong-In found out about the code in Dongmongseonseub.  (Children's practice (text) book in Joseon) 

679
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:28,280
If I donâ€™t leave now, more people will get hurt.

680
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,730
Then, I will accompany you.

681
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:38,060
The condition is that I must go alone. Isn't it enough to have only me kidnapped?

682
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,560
This is a trap.

683
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,600
Have you ever thought if it was the queen that gave Kim Byeon-In the code?

684
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,090
You clearly promised me.

685
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:51,730
If you found out the queen became your enemy, you'd cut her head off yourself.

686
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:55,240
The one you must cut off is not the people, but the queen's neck!

687
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,450
Clearly, the queen is not our enemy!

688
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,710
The queen turned against everyone to take my side.

689
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,960
If I donâ€™t leave right now, the queen will die!

690
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,500
Both of you must calm down. This is no time to fight amongst ourselves.

691
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,080
You told me I should be in more pain.

692
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,930
You're right.

693
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:22,160
I'll endure everything.

694
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:29,230
Your Majesty, your life will be in danger.

695
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,860
If I try to live, everyone will die.

696
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,330
I'm sure I saw him.

697
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,320
Was it a dream?

698
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:12,170
 Court Lady Choi. Hong Yeon! 

699
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:19,390
Let's go to Daejojeon. I think we missed the king.

700
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:22,160
- Yes, Your Majesty! 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

701
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,670
His Majesty is leaving right now.

702
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,330
Leaving? To go where?

703
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,490
We will leave now.

704
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,450
Hold on!

705
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:16,620
Stop right there! Hold on!

706
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,460
W-Why?

707
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,190
Why?

708
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:39,200
Is this the right road? It doesn't seem like a road for people to go down.

709
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,960
We are taking a shortcut.

710
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,930
Stop.

711
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:21,200
You're late. If you were going to do this anyway, you should have hurried more.

712
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,620
Will you get off yourself or do you need help?

713
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:42,730
I donâ€™t have a place to run to... so I'll have to do my best.

714
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:45,320
Don't worry.

715
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,670
It's enough for me to do alone.

716
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,060
 I just have to get rid of you. 

717

722

 This little one sure eats quite a lot! 

723
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,460
 Say, "Father, please hurry back." 

724
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,160
 I think I just felt something! 

725
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,640
 Your Majesty! The King... 

726
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,030
 Now, the owner of that seat will change. 

727
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:21,710
 What is the use of this? 

728
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,850
 You're not here... 

729
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,190
 They are not guilty. 

730
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,870
 Standing on the weak side is also a crime. 

731
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:28,160
 Hyungnim, how far are you going to take things? 

732
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,290
 Above all, please be born healthily and safely. 

733
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:34,290
 The life of the queen who, together with you, pushed the king to his death, 

734
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,180
 I will take with my own hands. 

735

â™«   Always standing at the same place   â™«
