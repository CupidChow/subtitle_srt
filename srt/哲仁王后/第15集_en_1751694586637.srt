00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,580
(This drama is a purely fictional group of characters
The incidents are irrelevant to history.)

2
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,980
If you're embarrassed to say it

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,830
Then let's set a signal that only we know.

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,830
Like this

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,050
What's this

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,500
What I'm saying now is all lies

7
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,610
This means

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,470
How simple is it?

9
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,010
The king does not lie.

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,770
(Episode 15)

11
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,660
Such a young child

12
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,300
What's the crime?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,630
The smell of wine and this subtle fragrance

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,820
She didn't drink poison.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,260
You let her use such tender hands

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,810
Feed yourself poison

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,800
The hands are warm

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,970
She's alive

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,760
My Queen, please accept my condolences.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,600
sandalwood

21
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:47,615
grown ups

22
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:48,805
You are here

23
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,685
It's an adult

24
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:51,795
Give

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,180
How can such a young child be left in the wild?

26
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,150
At least a simple funeral should be held

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,660
I can feel more comfortable

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,070
Then, sir, please walk slowly.

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,990
You guys go back

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,720
What about sandalwood?

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,040
Is she okay?

32
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,930
You should have left the palace safely by now.

33
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,590
I cancelled her mother's official slave status

34
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,370
Arrangements have been made for them to leave Hanyang together.

35
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,120
She's going to see her mother.

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,090
She used to be worried that her mother only had four nails.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,610
Very good

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,810
It's really great

39
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,140
But how did you do it?

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,180
Did you use sleeping pills?

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,450
I asked her to drink the paralysis powder

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,640
Is this the paralysis powder that the famous doctor Hua Tuo used when he performed surgery?

43
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,940
So you know

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,050
Of course I know

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,080
How many times did I watch Children's Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,310
Children's Three Kingdoms

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,780
But you

48
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,260
At least you should have informed me in advance.

49
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,020
Emergency

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,010
Don't let too many people know

51
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,020
Is there any news from Hong Bie-gun?

52
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,810
yes

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,120
child

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,050
Already escaped safely

55
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,050
Thanks for your hard work

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,640
For a child

57
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,270
You are so risky

58
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,960
Too reckless

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,000
Not just a kid

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,750
If you give up that child

61
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,050
Then, when facing ten or a hundred

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,440
It will be easier for all people to give up

63
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,720
This guy Cheoljong

64
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,100
I thought it was stupid

65
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,300
It's so stupid

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,800
You don't have such a good idea.

67
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,860
Will live soon

68
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,260
Sorry, my goal is not to live a hundred years.

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,150
Your values are too suitable for premature death

70
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,310
Don't you see who it is because of now?

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,740
She is thanking me

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,660
The language of the nave is different from others

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,260
I find the Middle Temple Dictionary of the

74
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,280
Why do I still feel so confused and puzzled?

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,130
Did you see it?

76
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,650
The book was open blatantly.

77
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,270
But

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,790
Has the location of the nave always been so dangerous?

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,860
Why does everyone want to kill me?

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,290
I'll stop it later.

81
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,490
I won't let something like this happen again.

82
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,150
No

83
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,780
I'm going to resist in my own way.

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,660
The best defense is offense

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,530
Starting today

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,910
I am the madwoman of this palace

87
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,750
(Episode 15: The Crazy Woman in This Area)

88
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,780
Do you want to get rid of the Queen?

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,390
The Queen Mother is the Lord's person

90
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,290
She told the Lord about her family's weaknesses.

91
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,480
She surrendered to her master and abandoned her family

92
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,390
impossible

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,030
You don't want to believe it?

94
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,620
The nave you adore

95
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,950
The result is just a

96
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,090
A foolish woman who fell in love with a man and refused to change her mind

97
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,440
Since I entered this house

98
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,450
I did everything to get your approval.

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,870
But it's not just because I want to stay.

100
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,000
I want to follow you

101
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,750
Respect you

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,490
But from the moment you wanted to get rid of the Queen

103
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,140
You are not my father anymore.

104
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,160
No matter who dares to touch the queen's hair

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
I will chop off his head

106
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,640
You can come back anytime

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,270
Even if you don't consider me your father

108
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,810
But you will always be my son

109
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,840
Who could it be?

110
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,060
The one who hid the account books in the Dazao Temple

111
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,990
The most suspicious person is

112
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,150
Even if I didn't deliberately make enemies

113
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,940
Those two people who are still my enemies

114
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,980
Queen Jo Hwa-jin

115
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,910
As for the motive, Zhao Huazhen is more likely the culprit.

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,540
When she was hunting in the mountains

117
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,940
Absolutely correct

118
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,840
But Zhao Huazhen hasn't been to the Dazao Hall recently.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
Judging from the movement lines, Queen Jo is more likely to be the culprit.

120
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,360
here

121
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,990
She's been coming in and out of here so frequently lately. It's really suspicious.

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,490
Of course, Queen Consort Zhao also had clear motives.

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,810
So it's really Queen Jo?

124
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,930
The fox

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,580
How did the account book end up in the hands of Queen Jo?

126
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,570
That's the mystery

127
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,510
But what kind of account book is that?

128
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,850
I didn't do any rituals today.

129
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,200
I apologize for my previous disrespect.

130
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,490
There's no reason why you wouldn't bow down to me.

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,670
Why are you doing this?

132
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,580
As expected, Queen Consort, you

133
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,930
Very observant

134
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,270
Thank you for coming from afar

135
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,220
Today's events should also make everyone feel deeply touched.

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,070
Now compared to the door

137
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,320
The life and death of us scholars is the most urgent matter.

138
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,060
As the saying goes, lips and teeth are interdependent.

139

Neither party can retreat peacefully.

144
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,550
Therefore I

145
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,040
I hope the two families can live in harmony.

146
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:15,980
Hereby proposes a general amnesty

Amnesty

151
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,160
Our two families have been at the mercy of each other's mistakes.

152
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,240
Many talented people were dismissed from their official positions

153
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,250
So we need an amnesty.

154
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,430
Pardon Talent

155
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,890
This is a symbol of agreement.

156
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,090
It's also a gift.

157
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,360
how

158
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,110
Would you like to join me?

159
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,840
Even though the military minister embezzled public funds without authorization

160
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,230
However, he was also guilty of not disciplining his officials.

161
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,530
therefore

162
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,460
Chen Jin Zuogen

163
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Voluntarily resigned as a training general

164
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,230
I will never fall like this.

165
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,850
As long as I have breath

166
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,810
Eat slowly

167
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,940
Do you feel it's not enough?

168
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,830
If the young still have any sense of shame

169
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,050
I shouldn't be able to eat.

170
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,200
Why on earth are you running away?

171
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,040
I shouldn't have been bad to you before.

172
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,160
That's because

173
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,200
mother

174
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,020
mother

175
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,210
Thank you for your hard work, Tan Xiang.

176
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,470
We, Sandalwood, have suffered.

177
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,270
mother

178
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,620
It's alright

179
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,090
It's alright

180
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,910
At least we have to force ourselves to smile

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,150
You can't stay in sorrow for too long.

182
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,630
yes

183
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,580
My lady, it's time to get up.

184
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,530
Niangniang

185
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,040
Did you not sleep all night last night?

186
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,270
What if you hurt your body?

187
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,390
There are too many distracting thoughts in my mind.

188
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,680
I really can't sleep

189
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,650
Back to the point

190
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,190
They must have slept well last night.

191
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,490
Who are you referring to?

192
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,870
The one who plotted against me

193
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,530
Last night they were able to stretch their legs

194
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,670
Last night of good sleep

195
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,630
You have to sleep well.

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,460
Choi Sang-Gong

197
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,250
yes

198
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,870
You send someone to find my father.

199
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,950
Let him come to the palace to see me immediately

200
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,470
It's the queen

201
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,940
Niangniang

202
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,990
Lord Fuyuan requests an audience

203
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,690
So fast

204
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,010
My daughter also wants to see her father.

205
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,990
I didn't expect you to come here first.

206
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,000
yes

207
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,770
Then I was right.

208
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,310
Last time

209
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,280
You speak first

210
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,560
No, no

211
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,330
Madam, please speak first.

212
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,810
No, Dad, you tell me first.

213
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,670
I'm so sorry for last time. I'm so sorry for last time.

214
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,770
No, no, no, no

215
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,020
I first, I first

216
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,260
It turns out that blood ties cannot be deceived.

217
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,070
Who says it isn't?

218
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,870
that

219
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,500
The reason why I came to you

220
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,220
Because of the ledger

221
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,560
You got it

222
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,350
Everyone is in a mess because of the books.

223
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,360
What kind of account book is that?

224
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,600
That's recorded.

225
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,650
The Account Book of Family Corruption

226
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,180
The handle of Ancheng's door

227
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,970
That's why Cheoljong wanted to get the account book.

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,470
It is precisely because of the account book that I asked to see you.

229
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,120
When the Queen and His Highness lived in the family home

230
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,390
The ledger disappeared

231
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,290
I have always doubted Your Highness.

232
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
But not long ago

233
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,630
A servant ran away

234
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,620
But luckily we caught him.

235
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,240
Then I asked why he ran away.

236
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,030
The day before the account book disappeared

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,870
Yipin came home

238
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,650
Because the house has become a mess

239
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,850
I thought something was wrong and I ran away.

240
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,880
So now

241
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,440
Sorry, ma'am.

242
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,730
This is not something you should be sorry about, Dad.

243
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,810
so

244
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,270
Just completed the whole puzzle

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,890
What

246
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,070
Directly harmed my sister Chunyuan

247
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,680
I specially prepared it today.

248
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,180
Ice is more precious than gold.

249
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,090
The Queen Consort Zhao who secretly harmed me

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
I'll prepare it for you later

251
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,800
I want to try it now

252
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,050
Zhao Huazhen, who caused all this

253
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,260
You should speak for yourself, sir.

254
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,380
Are you threatening me?

255
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,190
What you want

256
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,920
I understand

257
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,590
Father

258
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm going somewhere now

259
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,470
Where to go

260
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,100
To open the gates of hell

261
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,110
I will make you understand

262
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,740
Who did you offend?

263
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,150
A child like a deer

264
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,440
How long has it been since I entered the palace? I've changed so much.

265
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,100
Even if the saying goes that the people who know their children least are their parents

266
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,880
Like a deer

267
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,500
If we must use an animal metaphor,

268
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,760
Probably a wild horse

269
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,300
My daughter is a wild horse

270
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,470
Maori tattoo

271
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,170
Peacock feathers

272
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,960
The Devil Wears Prada

273
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,820
Strong is beautiful

274
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,250
I'm going to wear the most beautiful combat uniform in the world today

275
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
How about it

276
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,340
very good

277
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,230
Revenge is a beautiful thing

278
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,520
What are you going to do?

279
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,190
What you see is not all

280
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,820
Want to know what's in your mind

281
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,220
You have to cut open the stomach to see it.

282
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,440
I thought it was a potato

283
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,190
He deceived me without anyone noticing.

284
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,190
How can you cut open my stomach without any consideration?

285
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,970
First, you need to know whether it is potato or sweet potato

286
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,270
Then cut it open.

287
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,610
You can never redeem yourself like this.

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,150
Start serving food

289
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,030
I prepared this brunch today because

290
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,270
I want to repay the Queen Mother for what she did last time.

291
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,630
A precious gift

292
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,120
The drink I tried last time tasted really good

293
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,860
Two people drinking

294
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,980
I don't even know if one of them died.

295
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,010
Try it

296
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,140
I'm not thirsty

297
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,800
This is my sincerity, please have a taste

298
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,570
I said no

299
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,660
Why

300
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,980
It was not easy to make.

301
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,740
If you insist on doing so

302
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,310
It turns out that ice cubes are only delicious when chewed

303
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,830
I said it before

304
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,640
I will help you stay beautiful and healthy every day

305
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,550
I will try my best in the future

306
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,270
As long as you start to doubt what you eat, drink, and apply

307
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,010
Life is about to become hell

308
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,920
Your husband has begun to take charge of the government

309
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,070
Is this why you're so proud?

310
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,440
Betrayed the family

311
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,640
Do you think you can keep your throne?

312
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,290
The King and the Concubine

313
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,300
I don't believe in family and husband

314
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,810
I just believe in myself

315
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,670
Oh, Shangshan

316
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,100
It's your highness

317
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,790
I forgot to work hard for my offspring recently.

318
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,820
I'm so indifferent to the role of the king.

319
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,650
So report it quickly.

320
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,350
Report it?

321
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,920
Your Highness

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Where do you want me to report?

323
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,400
Isn't that the place Shangshan always goes to?

324
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,610
Hey you guy

325
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,340
You exposed your crime.

326
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,260
Your Highness, please grant me death.

327
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,710
What’s wrong with you

328
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,240
I didn't tell you

329
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,540
oops

330
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,710
From now on, my life belongs to you, Your Highness.

331
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,140
I don't need these

332
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,550
What do I do with your life?

333
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,970
Please kill His Majesty

334
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,150
Really, I said no.

335
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,340
Shangshan, what can you do?

336
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,520
If you are asked to go, you have to go

337
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,810
Just get angry at me, Your Highness

338
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,030
You're more terrible.

339
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,770
Such a coward

340
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,430
How can I be a spy?

341
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,570
I have to go somewhere before the imperial meeting

342
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,200
Shangshan, please go to Renzheng Hall first.

343
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,380
You better hide and watch it.

344
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,470
You scared our chef.

345
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,670
Why

346
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,950
How was your last night?

347
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,070
Is this how you greet an elder?

348
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,910
Because my headdress is too heavy

349
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,620
Unable to bow

350
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,860
This is a sacred place for worshipping the ancestors.

351
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,570
It's disrespectful to come here so gorgeously

352
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,350
It is right to dress well when you go to get a refund

353
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,520
Oh my god, look at me

354
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,450
I forgot to burn incense to the late kings.

355
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,730
You actually brought shame upon yourself.

356
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,390
Don't go

357
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,890
Because I also believe in Confucianism

358
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,180
Can't maintain proper etiquette, unbearable

359
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,100
I told you not to touch

360
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,680
You left something in my room.

361
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,990
Suddenly came to me to invade my private life

362
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,270
result

363
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,810
It was that thing

364
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,330
What are you doing?

365
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,200
I said

366
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,210
I'm asking for a refund

367
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,420
I have to pay you back for the injustice I suffered.

368
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,730
How can you be so presumptuous?

369
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,580
He actually framed his elders and questioned them.

370
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Although it was like this before

371
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,500
The level of disrespect is particularly serious today.

372
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,840
Is it because he didn't have a mother to teach him?

373
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,330
Hey, Grandma

374
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,760
If I am uneducated because I don't have a mother

375
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,140
Auntie, you don't have any children.

376
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,470
Is that so rude?

377
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,680
Very hot

378
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,450
It's so infuriating.

379
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,500
I can't stand hot things.

380
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,830
I almost painted a picture of my beloved son

381
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,650
It's burned.

382
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,140
nave

383
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
Are you crazy?

384
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,050
It's crazy

385
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,510
And it's still proper

386
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,290
I seem to be the craziest among all the crazy women

387
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,800
So be careful

388
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,110
Try touching one of my hairs.

389
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,650
Be careful that you will never see your son's face again

390
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,360
It's not the nave I have to worry about.

391
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,230
But other people

392
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,970
The best defense is offense

393
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,710
oops

394
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,720
I haven't seen our Yipin.

395
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,970
I don't know how weak my sense of existence is.

396
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,490
I'm playing with water

397
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,550
Wanna play together?

398
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,730
Play by yourself

399
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,140
Account Book

400
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,280
I heard you took it.

401
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,720
I nearly died because of that ledger.

402
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,290
Tell me what you think

403
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,880
Is that what you want?

404
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,590
Did you really not kill Hongyue?

405
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,460
No matter what I say

406
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,180
You will believe what you want.

407
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,000
I stole the Lord

408
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,090
Kill Hongyue and throw her into the well

409
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,350
So I am a bad woman who deserves death

410
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,300
You are a kind and poor victim.

411
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,440
So the victim's cosplay is scary

412
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,210
I didn't know I had become a monster.

413
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,010
Because every day I'm turning into a monster

414
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,900
Look in the mirror

415
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,350
How ugly are you

416
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,150
You catch it yourself

417
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,550
I'm not in such a generous mood now.

418
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,710
When I fell into the lake in front of you

419
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,090
Maybe you too

420
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,320
Can you catch me?

421
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,820
Use this

422
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,810
I proved that I'm a better person than you

423
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,790
Kim Jakeun, former training general

424
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,110
He abdicated himself.

425
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,510
Yes, Your Highness

426
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,710
Because the impeachment process is late

427
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,280
Almost holding ministers accountable

428
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,540
What a shame

429
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,050
Really

430
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,410
Slip of the tongue

431
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,560
I wanted to say fortunately

432
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,210
Therefore, today's motion

433
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,850
Today, I will

434
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,730
Announcement to the ministers

435
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,790
Establishment of an official office to correct the three political malpractices

436
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,910
Name

437
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,360
Three Political Rectification Office

438
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,890
Is this the Sanzheng Rectification Hall?

439
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,000
Will formulate relevant laws

440
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,500
Prepare a fundamental teaching strategy

441
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,980
Playing a role in rectifying the three political systems

442
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,930
North Korea is a country that survives on agriculture

443
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,740
Only if the peasants survive can the country survive

444
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,580
therefore

445
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,610
Request to the leaders

446
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,810
It is an act of destroying a country.

447
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,200
after

448
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,090
They will be punished for treason.

449
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,670
The establishment of a new government office must be handled with caution

450
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,580
After listening to the ministers’ opinions

451
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,410
Because it is the right thing to do.

452
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,010
No compromise

453
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,340
Meaning

454
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,880
I will never look at the ministers' eyes again.

455
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,120
besides

456
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,180
The posthumous title of the late king Shunzong

457
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,180
According to the principle of ancestral merits and virtues

458
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,790
(Zugong Zongde: The king who made great contributions was given the posthumous title of Zu
The virtuous kings were given the posthumous title of "Zong"
According to the principle of ancestral merits and virtues

459
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,060
(Zugong Zongde: The king who made great contributions was given the posthumous title of Zu
The virtuous kings were given the posthumous title of "Zong"

460
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,670
Named Shunzu
(Zugong Zongde: The king who made great contributions was given the posthumous title of Zu
The virtuous kings were given the posthumous title of "Zong"

461
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:28,740
(Zugong Zongde: The king who made great contributions was given the posthumous title of Zu
The virtuous kings were given the posthumous title of "Zong"

462
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,650
Today, Lord

463
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,770
It's particularly chaotic

464
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,060
Your Highness

465
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,190
New appointment today

466
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,150
Du Chengzhi also said the wrong thing

467
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,340
It shouldn't be an appointment.

468
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,450
The position of Military Minister is vacant

469
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,570
The crisis of military power

470
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,610
A national crisis

471
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,330
therefore

472
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,860
Through the Border Defense Department

473
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,580
Urgent appointment required

474
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,660
Let the Military Minister come in

475
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,750
Minister of Military Affairs Kim Byeong-in

476
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,950
Come and pay your respects

477
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,490
What is scary about Kim Byung-in is

478
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,340
Bring in the Zhao family

479
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,000
The two families urged for an amnesty.

480
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,890
It was also done by Kim Byung-in.

481
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,990
It must be difficult to ignore so many petitions.

482
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,850
A little carelessness

483
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,870
It will become a reason for all the scholars to resist

484
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,610
Since he is in charge of government affairs

485
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,240
You can do what you want

486
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,380
It's still hard to stop doing what you don't want to do

487
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,260
It is true that the best defense is offense.

488
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,780
Now compared to restraint

489
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,090
Who can attack faster is the key

490
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,310
There's no time to find someone.

491
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,270
The elder brother is the chief of the Lizheng Hall.

492
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,720
Hong Biejian, you are the censor

493
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,570
(Responsible for special tasks
And accept the imperial order to send the censor)
Hong Biejian, you are the censor

494

(Responsible for special tasks
And accept the imperial order to send the censor)

495
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,210

497
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,260
Conduct an investigation
(Responsible for special tasks
And accept the imperial order to send the censor)

498
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,420
Conduct an investigation

499
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,630
Another business trip to the suburbs

500
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,780
Please help me

501
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,900
How can we gradually

502
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,060
Two people sitting in the palace are only responsible for giving orders with their mouths.

503
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,900
It seems like I'm the only one running around. Is this just psychological?

504
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,950
What a person

505
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,530
I have always been in my heart

506
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,340
If the mission of the Nuclear Censor is completed

507
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,690
Give you a vacation

508
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,080
I'm on a business trip.

509
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:07,960
Give

510
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,420
Might give

511
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,230
I said I might give it to you.

512
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,700
I definitely didn't hear the second half.

513
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,570
Really useless

514
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,910
Your Highness

515
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,280
Empress of the Middle Temple

516
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,220
A letter came

517
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,400
I won't hurt you. Come here.

518
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,790
The Queen Mother

519
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,860
A letter came

520
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,790
Are you feeling unwell?

521
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm so weak.

522
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,500
The so-called revenge is really

523
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,330
I thought I would feel refreshed

524
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,710
It's really refreshing

525
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,560
So exciting

526
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,910
His Majesty the Lord

527
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,770
You are here

528
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,660
Today's look is particularly gorgeous.

529
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,810
You are also suitable for this

530
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,790
The completion of fashion is the face

531
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,660
I will look good in anything I wear

532
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,540
But who knew that even the middle temple's body would be a good fit?

533
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,240
There's no way to get familiar with it right away.

534
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,950
I didn't ask you to meet for anything else.

535
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,260
Become my ally

536
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,190
Anyway, my family also thinks I will do this.

537
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,280
So you're targeting me.

538
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,380
Isn't it time to get the money back?

539
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,330
Stand on the same side with me

540
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,750
This means we will become enemies with the Jin family.

541
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,010
I was the first one to be abandoned by my family.

542
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,920
Now it's my turn to abandon my home.

543
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,970
If the enemies are the same, then they are allies, right?

544
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,780
good

545
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,710
Start now

546
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,570
The middle temple and I are no longer no touch

547
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,460
That's right

548
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,270
From now on, no touch is prohibited

549
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,580
Watching a movie

550
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,900
All of them have to drink from the wine glass with blood dripping from it.

551
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,150
In this recent era

552
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,960
It's not good to use that unhygienic method.

553
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,900
Let's declare our alliance by sharing tea

554
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,760
Simple

555
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,070
Is this an alliance?

556
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,130
Yeah, that's how it was.

557
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,110
one shot

558
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,600
Now that we are allies

559
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,600
Let's not have anything that makes us feel uncomfortable.

560
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,560
Why do you want to kill me?

561
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,320
That's right

562
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,180
This is also something that we will have to face and overcome one day.

563
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,530
Because I think the assassination of the father-in-law by the middle palace is related

564
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,600
No matter what, it's my father-in-law.

565
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,860
That's just one of the corruption things.

566
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,540
Vicious guy

567
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,410
Too

568
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,130
You're the guy who wants to kill your own wife.

569
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,840
Serial killer in the wife's family

570
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,010
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,970
Although it may not make sense to say this now.

572
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,210
But there are also many misunderstandings and situations.

573
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,960
OK

574
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,560
Then you owe me

575
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,400
I haven't forgiven you until I pay it back.

576
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,070
So what is this related to?

577
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,180
Kingship?

578
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,180
Kingship

579
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,700
Just to correct the broken North Korean props

580
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,480
I think the world won't change fundamentally.

581
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
So tell the truth

582
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,630
I am more satisfied with the idea that the goal is a tool than the idea that the goal is a tool.

583
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,740
If the kingship becomes stronger, I will also become stronger

584
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,270
It's impossible for people to treat me casually

585
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,240
I know all too well the fear of death threats

586
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,960
Although you pretend to be very strong

587
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,170
Actually, I guess I'm scared.

588
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,600
It's hard to say

589
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,030
I don't know if it's because I died once.

590
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,280
I hate being stepped on more than dying.

591
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,210
If I could chew up all the shoes that stepped on me

592
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,720
Even if I die, I can die with a smile on my face.

593
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,150
Niangniang

594
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,060
It's time to prepare for lunch

595
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,550
In this sense

596
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,870
I'll go chew it. Bye.

597
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,180
I

598
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,460
Will die with a smile

599
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,020
Die with a smile

600
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,580
Guozhang

601
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,490
Yes, Byung-in

602
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,850
Not our military commander

603
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,780
Are you kidding me?

604
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,640
Are you kidding me?

605
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,740
Just call me in the way that's comfortable for you.

606
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,660
In fact

607
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,350
For our Queen

608
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,670
I have something to say about Zhao Rong, so I am waiting for you here.

609
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,480
I also

610
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,060
I have something to tell you about the Queen.

611
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,280
this

612
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,970
Where is it placed?

613
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,720
Where is it placed?

614
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,950
Wait a moment

615
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,520
I saw

616
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,290
Hello

617
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,120
How long have you been in the imperial kitchen and you're already holding a knife?

618
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,130
We wouldn't be like this back then.

619
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,980
These people recently

620
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,700
Even if you say you want to have a glass of rice wine after work

621
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,270
I don't know why I'm so unwilling.

622
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,160
Really

623
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,530
The elders bought him wine.

624
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,940
I don't know what I'm unwilling to do.

625
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,300
This kid

626
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,540
Me too

627
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,150
I can't empathize with the younger generation

628
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,760
Said you could come later

629
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,140
I actually came a little late.

630
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,980
Should have come here to prepare in advance

631
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
These people recently, these people recently

632
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,740
Send to Tonghua Temple

633
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,400
this

634
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,720
One mushroom pancake left

635
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,600
Mushroom Pancakes

636
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,180
It would be better to respond in the same way.

637
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,540
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

638
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,760
So

639
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,400
Relics and Job's tears

640
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,640
Relics and Job's tears

641
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,970
There are a lot of things that are good for the body.

642
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,310
What time do you get when you mix these together?

643
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,230
This plan is too long-term.

644
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,820
Let's go hot

645
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,940
Castration

646
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,340
Castration

647
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,790
First time listening

648
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,250
Castration

649
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,810
Such precious food

650
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,700
I'm not here to burden you.

651
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,110
I

652
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,280
A man who knows how to give up

653
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,070
Deeply terrified

654
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,180
What's the fear?

655
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,350
at last

656
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,940
Can I ask a question?

657
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,370
yes

658
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,550
Madam, why

659
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,570
I hate men with desires.

660
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,670
Life in the Palace

661
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,440
I've seen too many people with desires.

662
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,690
And those people are struggling hard

663
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,020
I fear and hate those

664
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,490
Thanks for your answer

665
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,930
If I dare to expect something from my wife

666
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,110
I hope that cheerful smile can last forever

667
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,600
you

668
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,440
It's over

669
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,790
Are you afraid that someone will say your sixth sense is not sharp?

670
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,480
The eyes are so quick.

671
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,850
Crying like this

672
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,750
How could I not know?

673
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,270
Don't watch it

674
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,880
Like this

675
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,240
I don't want to be seen by anyone

676
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,890
Then you go over there

677
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,550
These people must think that I made you cry.

678
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,170
No

679
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,380
I will never cry again

680
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,930
A clean abandonment

681
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,800
It's also a token of my longing.

682
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,960
Maybe

683
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,150
This is more difficult to do than to keep yearning for it.

684
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,500
They've all become poets.

685
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
You guy

686
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,820
Stop crying

687
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,790
Finally, the meal has to be served.

688
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,920
This ominous picture is

689
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,570
Oh my god, it's so beautiful

690
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,630
Even if Qian Shanggong took poison, he could survive.

691
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,210
Because I can't find

692
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,330
And suddenly praised me

693
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,770
Empress of the Middle Temple

694
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:50,820
Han Shen Weng sends you greetings

695
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,620
Have we met somewhere?

696
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,710
The common people are terrified

697
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,250
Fear

698
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,270
No, no

699
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,570
I feel deeply terrified.

700
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,600
Compared to this sentence

701
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,160
It should be something else.

702
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,570
If this continues

703
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm gonna kill you

704
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,150
Thanks to you

705
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,600
All the things that made me feel uncomfortable were thrown away

706
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,830
Just like what it says

707
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,110
Throw it straight into the sky

708
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,700
I couldn't even recognize you, the Queen Mother.

709
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,350
I have committed a serious crime.

710
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,160
Didn't know it was me?

711
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,330
So why run?

712
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:39,940
that

713
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,560
That's because such a noble person is chasing me

714
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,990
I was scared, that's all.

715
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,770
Yeah

716
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,750
Actually, I called you because I wanted to give Han an official title.

717
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,670
It's a good location

718
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,460
A career where you don't have to worry about being laid off for the rest of your life

719
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,760
The monthly stipend is also high, although it will be cut off

720
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,490
What

721
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,380
What did you just say to cut off?

722
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,080
At first glance, I feel

723
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,600
Your face is suitable for that position.

724
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,350
Your Majesty, I am terrified

725
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,740
You will be my eunuch.

726
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,200
Wait a minute, eunuch

727
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,270
Wait a minute, wait a minute, waitress

728
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,530
Wait a minute, open it up

729
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,760
The eunuch is really

730
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,510
Madam, please think twice about the great grace of the Holy Spirit.

731
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,630
No, but why do you treat me like this?

732
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,500
The first crime of buying a fake family tree to pretend to be a yangban

733
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,370
No, it's not your fault.

734
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,940
The social structure that distinguishes the two classes of slaves

735
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,430
Very true.

736
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,610
Re-First

737
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,980
Poisoned the water tank in the imperial kitchen

738
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,820
The sin of spoiling the king's banquet

739
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,640
The second sin of giving birth to a wrong offspring

740
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,710
What offspring

741
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,470
Didn't I say something wrong about my ancestors?

742
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,450
Not sure

743
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,380
You gave birth to the wrong offspring.

744
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,840
Not descendants

745
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,410
Not the empress.

746
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,900
If I become a eunuch, I will have no offspring.

747
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,620
Eunuchs cannot have offspring.

748
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,220
MILF

749
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,100
I can't have offspring.

750
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,600
Hey, eunuch, do you have offspring?

751
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,990
You see, I will have no descendants.

752
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,620
MILF

753
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,690
Madam, the Military Minister is here

754
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,660
Princess

755
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,180
Ancheng and Kinmen are definitely of one mind.

756
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,980
But my father is also from Ancheng Jinmen

757
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,510
Now it's so natural to call him father

758
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,580
It's really serious.

759
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,180
I just found out after we met yesterday

760
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,230
What happened to the queen

761
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,320
Such a big thing happened

762
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,990
You don't know you're going to kill me?

763
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,270
I am not my father's person nor am I from Kinmen.

764
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,750
But you can't get away from them.

765
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,100
You'll know later

766
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,720
Is it the enemy or our army?

767
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,880
How can we be Zhaorong?

768
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,720
No matter what, she actually took our Queen

769
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,330
I will immediately send this guy Jin Zuogen

770
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,400
Damn

771
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,130
Even the Three Political Councils

772
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,550
In the end, that was also an excuse for corrupt officials.

773
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,620
Plan to pull down our door.

774
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,930
Don't worry

775
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,090
If you really take it that seriously, there is no one who is not a sinner.

776
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,010
To protect yourself, you have to protect those people.

777
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,810
So the Three Political Affairs Council will become an empty shell.

778
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,010
Even if it is a temporary alliance

779
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,850
Don't even blink in front of Queen Jo

780
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,650
Although the face is always smiling

781
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,840
But there's always a knife behind

782
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,290
I will remember

783
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,330
Quan Shang Gong

784
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,870
It's the queen

785
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,110
Remove the table and call the doctor, Mrs. Park,

786
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,060
It's the queen

787
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,380
Are you withdrawing so soon?

788
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,000
Loss of appetite

789
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,740
I heard that he was very satisfied with the meal prepared by the middle temple.

790
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,990
Not a great taste either.

791
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,100
It is the degree of import

792
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,910
The nave is very sad now

793
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,260
It is said that it was because of Concubine Yi's alienation

794
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,290
The family member regarded him as an enemy and felt very guilty.

795
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,650
Yipin

796
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,820
I also heard from the father-in-law today

797
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:10,130
The one who deceived the queen was not the princess but Concubine Yi

798
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,980
The Lord is coming down

799
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,860
Ask him to come in

800
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,140
Your Highness

801
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,470
I'm sorry for coming here so late without even saying hello.

802
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,380
No, I just feel panic at any time.

803
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,910
I have something to tell you

804
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,190
What is it?

805
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,160
The body of a palace maid was found in a well not long ago

806
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:57,190
The Queen Mother ordered this.

807
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,500
Queen Dowager?

808
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,110
Not why

809
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,220
Didn't the concubine think of it?

810
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,490
Then the corpse

811
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,880
Not Red Moon

812
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,030
How could it be that it is clearly a red moon?

813
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,070
It is difficult to distinguish the state of the face

814
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,150
How can we confirm that it is the red moon?

815
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,480
Wearing maid's clothes

816
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,640
The missing maid is only Hongyue

817
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,470
Yes, I know that it is Hongyue.

818
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:37,410
The Queen Mother may want the concubine to rely on him.

819
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,510
But why a well?

820
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,810
I told you about my experience in the well.

821
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,540
Although the well is the place where I saw His Highness

822
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,270
But it's also a painful place

823
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,540
Thinking of His Highness,

824
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,170
I'm sure I've lost someone precious

825
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,230
It turns out that I can’t just talk about my pain.

826
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,470
This is the palace.

827
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,570
Please pull down the nave.

828
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,110
In my nightmare

829
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,230
Never trust the Queen again.

830
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:41,830
From now on, I will pretend I don't know in front of the Queen Mother.

831
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,940
I also feel for the Queen Mother

832
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,310
A deep sense of betrayal and disappointment

833
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:53,550
Wells are places where I am haunted by the horror of death.

834
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,870
I didn't expect to use that

835
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,490
It's similar to poker flower cards.

836
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,980
It's a waste of time, a waste of life

837
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,990
Game game This is the best

838
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,590
Fortunately, my lady

839
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,550
We are afraid that the queen will be sad because of sandalwood

840
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,900
Sorry, Madam.

841
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,560
Don't worry, Sandalwood has gone to a good place

842
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,080
I guess we went to a good place, right?

843
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,080
sandalwood

844
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,210
No, no, I mean

845
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,580
Really went to a good place

846
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,870
It's the sandalwood

847
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,120
Really went to a good place

848
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,810
Why do you always cry?

849
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,030
sorry

850
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,110
At this look

851
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,420
Haven't said goodbye to our sandalwood yet.

852
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,200
sandalwood

853
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,070
Niangniang

854
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,220
sandalwood

855
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,250
seven

856
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,720
eight

857
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,050
This is called nine

858
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,330
sorry

859
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,820
Really

860
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,640
sandalwood

861
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,340
sandalwood

862
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,810
All in

863
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,910
How did Queen Jo get the account book?

864
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,670
What we have been looking for but haven't found

865
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,160
It's already this time.

866
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,790
Is it right to bring in Queen Jo?

867
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,570
Just kidding

868
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,190
It's better than me wandering outside the palace.

869
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,720
So I felt ashamed.

870
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,170
But most of them are in the palace.

871
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:12,310
How did you get the account book?

872
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,580
Just look at her fake corpse

873
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,750
She must be managing people who are like her siblings.

874
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,260
Should we bring in her siblings?

875
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,480
Have you not found out the face of the person wearing the ghost mask?

876
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,750
I've been busy with police work lately.

877
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,100
To free mother sandalwood from untouchability

878
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,040
And to find her missing father.

879
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,890
Didn't we find Tan Xiang's missing father?

880
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,220
How to find people hiding in the mountains?

881
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,350
Definitely camping.

882
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,730
I will complete the nuclear censor's business trip soon.

883
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,700
Thinking about the upcoming vacation

884
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,990
It's really just barely

885
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,460
Barely holding on

886
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,340
Friend

887
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,070
I mean vacation

888
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,870
but

889
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,440
In that case, don't let me be the censor.

890
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,800
Let me be the secret imperial censor.

891
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,560
This one is more powerful.

892
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,410
Hide your identity

893
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:06,700
Then show the horse card

894
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,920
You are born to be a secret imperial historian.

895
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,010
That's right

896
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,030
Come again

897
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,760
Ah, I didn't expect the father-in-law to be such a person.

898
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,050
The people who really deserve to die are guys like Kim Jageun.

899
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:46,930
The father-in-law is

900
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,840
Now the only bloodline left

901
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,720
Hello

902
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,760
You want to kill both your father-in-law and your wife.

903
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,910
Can you sleep now?

904
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,240
Can't sleep

905
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,220
Don't mess with your heart.

906
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,470
It hurts my self-esteem.

907
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,870
I stayed in the water for a long time.

908
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,350
How breathless and painful it must be.

909
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,220
Found her body

910
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,630
It's a very accidental thing

911
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,270
Or maybe someone wants to drive a wedge between us.

912
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,940
I was thinking about something.

913
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,660
It's a big blow, right?

914
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,900
The palace is too big for me.

915
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,750
Not only do I feel lonely, but I also feel lost.

916
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,930
Found the maid who sold the ornaments to Hongyue

917
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,050
She said she just found something buried in the palace grounds.

918
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,900
Yeah

919
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,230
At the instigation of Queen Dowager Zhao

920
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,970
It was the same maid who threw the body into the well.

921
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,100
Red Moon is alive

922
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,520
She was in trouble in the palace.

923
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,790
Couldn't even take a step out of the palace.

924
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,360
One should not wish for a body fished out of a well

925
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,210
Isn't that Hong Yue's corpse?

926
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,190
Not the expectation of the corpse of the red moon

927
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,030
Shouldn't you be happy about this?

928
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,440
Why do you believe that the corpse is Red Moon?

929
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,530
You

930
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,670
What are you hiding?

931
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,920
Last time

932
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,930
The item you gave to Queen Jo

933
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,430
What is

934
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,430
Did you see it?

935
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,910
If you say no

936
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,800
I can't see anything

937
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,290
Anyone can get lost temporarily

938
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,810
Now you can return to your original position

939
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,420
What if I'm not temporarily lost?

940
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,960
That too

941
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,470
Can you return to your original position?

942
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,170
There's no going back

943
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,390
The Kindness

944
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,490
That corpse must be Red Moon

945
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,860
Not this late at night

946
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,670
Cooking Sanyang Ramen

947
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,500
Why do I crave ramen especially at night?

948
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,050
The next day, my face becomes very swollen.

949
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,460
Obviously know this

950
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,030
But it's really hard to overcome this temptation.

951
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,820
It's a pity that I've worked so hard for so long.

952
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,800
The Queen Mother does not eat at night

953
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,390
So I'll do it.

954
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,670
Not really

955
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,830
Now that you're here, you can just talk.

956
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,640
Why are you standing outside the door?

957
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,460
Do you want to finish your ramen before leaving?

958
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,340
What is Ramen?

959
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,670
Where are you going after eating?

960
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,140
Don't have any burden

961
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,020
It can be said to be a kind of exploration test

962
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,080
No, I can't do this.

963
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,460
Just take a bite then.

964
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,550
No, no, no

965
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,960
Ramen is an addictive taste

966
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,330
Once you take one bite, you can't stop.

967
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,840
What are you doing

968
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,070
I'm really conflicted.

969
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,070
What would you do if it were you?

970
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,120
Do you feel like you can eat ramen or not?

971
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,310
I thought I would start by explaining what ramen is.

972
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,330
first

973
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,370
First?

974
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,280
Let's try it first

975
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,940
Right?

976
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,450
You have to face everything head on to know

977
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,490
Was it because he was drunk?

978
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,460
Or because I'm really crazy

979
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,850
If neither

980
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,910
Is this really true?

981
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,040
Are we really saying the same thing now?

982
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,610
Of course

983
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,150
We are talking about ramen.

984
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,230
Come a little closer

985
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,370
Ramen is best eaten hot.

986
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,250
Really

987
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,570
What are you doing

988
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,380
Oh my god!

989
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,360
How to deal with such valuable things?

990
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,790
Do you know what this is? It's a valuable item.

991
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:17,990
For the nave

992
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,750
Why is this book for children so valuable?

993
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,840
That one

994
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,020
Is it the middle temple?

995
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,750
Are you the one who kept me alive?

996
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,310
It was you, Namdaemun, who rescued me from the well?

997
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,520
Yes, it's me.

998
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:08,650
(This drama is a purely fictional group of characters
The incidents are irrelevant to history.)

999
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,810
Our Cheoljong must be eagerly waiting for me to come over.

1000
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,110
Now you have dug a trap?

1001
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:38,290
Who would have thought that the declaration of war from the Middle Temple would be true?

1002
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:38,900
Is it my turn?

1003
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,680
Draw your sword

1004
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:42,700
If someone checked and got caught,

1005
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,860
You are solely responsible for everything.

1006
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:45,870
Even if he is eliminated

1007
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,700
Kim Byung-in's power is still growing

1008
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,600
I feel like I'm standing still.

1009
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,800
If Cheoljong succeeds

1010
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,830
The world will be different in 200 years.

1011
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,050
If I stand on your side, you will definitely win.

1012
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,650
Because I have a hidden weapon

1013
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:57,870
I know the future
