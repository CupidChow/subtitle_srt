00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:03,840
(Mr. Queen)

2
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:06,441
(This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations, )

3
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,635
(and events are unrelated
to historical events.)

4
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,011
(Episode 5)

5
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,375
Everyone has a fatal weakness.

6
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,760
Even Superman becomes
nothing more than a pervert...

7
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:25,555
who wears underwear on the
outside when faced with kryptonite.

8
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,025
If Superman becomes like that,

9
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,894
imagine what would
happen to ordinary people.

10
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,775
I will tell you the truth.

11
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:51,674
Grand Queen Dowager,
I will obey your order!

12
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:54,544
She is not the one who should be beheaded!

13
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:00,284
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:03,984
Please.

15
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,794
Will you go against the King's order?

16
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,775
To an ordinary person,
this world is like a minefield of weakness.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,550
We become one another's weakness...

18
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,585
and drag everyone to the underworld.

19
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:34,824
Even someone as perfect as me,
Jang Bong Hwan, had a weakness.

20
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,025
That is none other than...

21
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:43,764
I can't bear to see some other
guy looking cooler than me.

22
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,740
Those who tried to harm the Queen were...

23
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:48,805
Wait!

24
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,481
Especially when it's in front
of a woman I'm interested in.

25
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,645
I need to be the coolest person
in front of them to be satisfied.

26
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,391
You could say it's the only weakness...

27
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,184
of someone who is so perfect.

28
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,210
Since I am the alleged
victim of this incident,

29
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,204
allow me to shed light on the truth.

30
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,074
I...

31
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,104
was trying to take my own life.

32
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,415
I won't let you be the only cool one here.

33
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:38,454
Stay still, Cheoljong.

34
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,554
I should be the hero.

35
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:47,324
So please do not hurt
those who did nothing wrong.

36
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,764
Nice one.

37
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:54,435
What kind of a ludicrous statement is this?

38
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:55,935
Grand Queen Dowager.

39
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:59,875
I apologize,
but I was trying to end my own life.

40
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,251
("Desert your false self")

41
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,415
This is the suicide note that
I carry with me all the time.

42
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,215
I am going back tonight anyway.

43
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:15,625
I don't care if things get chaotic here.

44
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,854
Why on earth would you do that?

45
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,671
Furthermore,
why would you try to end your life...

46
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,695
on the night before you became queen?

47
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,595
The thing is...

48
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,535
What on earth is the reason?

49
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:34,475
The reason why I was so
depressed that I wanted to die was...

50
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,445
I'm sure I had a reason.

51
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:41,745
Your Highness!

52
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,054
Darn it!

53
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,731
Your Highness!

54
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:50,785
So Yong.

55
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,174
Is he going to carry me right now?

56
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:06,451
Don't.

57
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,375
Don't come near me. Go away!

58
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,695
Grand Queen Dowager.

59
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:36,581
The Queen is saying false things...

60
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:39,175
in order to save the life of
someone lesser than her.

61
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,651
Please look fondly
upon the virtuous heart...

62
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,921
of forgiving someone who had
committed a great sin against her,

63
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,474
and show mercy.

64
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,315
Oh, my. Is that how he translated it?

65
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:14,675
What is so interesting that so
many people have gathered?

66
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,445
Your...

67
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:22,945
Your Highness.

68
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:28,524
What on earth has happened?

69
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:31,425
All right then.

70
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,101
Since the Queen is trying so hard,

71
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,695
I will show mercy after seeing her efforts.

72
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,795
(Episode 5,
A Heel That Can Easily Get Hurt)

73
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:16,981
It has been a while since we
had such an interesting spectacle.

74
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,235
I wonder what the Queen
was thinking when doing that.

75
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,474
Perhaps it is the heart of a woman.

76
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,921
Regardless, we can be sure that
it was not a plan from the Kim clan.

77
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:27,974
Yes.

78
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:30,745
Are you going to Seoneonjeon Hall?

79
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:34,914
I need something other than prayer today.

80
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,324
She is nothing but a
weak Royal Noble Consort,

81
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,695
but she is our only arrow.

82
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:44,065
So we must put some
poison on that arrowhead.

83
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,414
Goodness.

84
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:13,275
What do you mean she tried to end her life?

85
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,324
What do you mean by that?

86
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,640
I need to bide my time and
wake up at the right moment.

87
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,795
I am such a foolish
father to not realize that.

88
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,005
I have committed a great sin.

89
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,805
I have committed a great sin.

90
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,105
It is all my fault.

91
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,974
I should have taken better care of her.

92
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,844
This is all because I am lacking.

93
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,584
What on earth is the reason?

94
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,784
You should know since you
assist her in close proximity.

95
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:42,584
She would try to jump into the water
multiple times whenever she could,

96
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:46,195
and I thought it was because
of the shock from falling in.

97
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,795
"Multiple times"?

98
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:55,764
How much was she suffering?

99
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:57,964
Your Highness.

100
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:01,334
Your Highness.

101
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,014
My gosh. Enough already.

102
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,344
If you keep crying, I can't wake up.

103
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:15,224
This is not the time for us to be crying.

104
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,954
If she sees us crying,

105
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,065
imagine how upset she would be.

106
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,295
That's right.

107
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,024
You are right.

108
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,135
At times like this,
we must stand by her side and be brave.

109
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,311
Should I get up now?

110
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,705
- So Yong. - My gosh.

111
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,304
When your mother gave birth to you,

112
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:41,985
she lost her life.

113
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,115
Is he starting again?

114
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,855
Your Highness.

115
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,924
Her Highness grew up...

116
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:56,370
without ever getting the
chance to see her mother's face.

117
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,465
I feel so bad for her.

118
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,434
I had no idea that she
was suffering so much,

119
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:05,064
and all I did was telling her
she could not do this or that.

120
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:08,475
I would chase after her...

121
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,075
and nag her all the time.

122
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:15,414
I might as well have been...

123
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:20,085
the person who pushed her into the lake.

124
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,924
Goodness, Your Highness.

125
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:27,394
Your Highness!

126
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,301
I give up.

127
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,664
This is not a situation I can handle.

128
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:36,865
(Gwanghwamun)

129
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:57,585
My Queen.

130
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:00,870
Please..

131
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,194
Take care of yourself.

132
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,365
Your pathetic father...

133
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:10,135
apologizes to you.

134
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:25,985
Byeong In.

135
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:30,985
I am entering the Palace today.

136
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,855
I am finally meeting
the King for the first time.

137
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:36,924
Are you that happy?

138
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,735
It is because I am curious.

139
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,365
One day, he appears as an ugly fool,

140
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:45,264
and on a different day,
he looks as though he was made from jade.

141
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,205
In my dreams.

142
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,274
Last night, he looked exactly like you.

143
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:02,054
I believed that I had to give
up on you to make you happy.

144
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:06,794
You were so happy before
you entered the Palace.

145
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:10,365
However, after entering the Palace,
you tried to end your own life.

146
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,304
Is it because of that?

147
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,000
She is crazy! She has lost her mind!

148
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:43,870
("Desert your false self")

149
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:46,740
She spent the past few nights
with the King. Are you sure that...

150
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:49,135
she was not the one who was
won over instead of the King?

151
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,335
Please calm down, Your Highness.

152
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,475
There is nothing to be
gained from being mad.

153
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,780
How can I not be mad?

154
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:58,575
We lost the perfect
opportunity like this so easily.

155
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,715
I cannot believe we
shot ourselves in the foot!

156
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,414
Furthermore,
did you see the King's behaviour just now?

157
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:07,061
That arrogant glare.

158
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,561
I saved him from living his days as
a countryman and made him king,

159
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:12,870
yet he dared to rebel against me like that?

160
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,794
We must discipline him if he rebels.

161
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,794
I will tighten the reigns,
so he knows his place.

162
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:25,524
What is the point of spending
time taking care of myself?

163
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:29,317
It all falls apart when I
worry over something once.

164
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:33,487
Call for Park, the doctor.

165
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:34,993
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:44,934
To be honest, the Queen came to see me...

167
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:49,213
on the night she fell into the lake.

168
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:57,513
Grand Queen Dowager. I...

169
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,554
will leave the Palace.

170
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:05,723
What are you talking about?

171
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,463
I cannot endure the position of Queen.

172
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:10,694
I do not want to live in such misery.

173
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:16,510
I had heard the rumours that
you have been acting atrocious,

174
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:18,204
but it was all on purpose...

175
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,044
so that you would not become Queen.

176
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,719
How cute.

177
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,223
I cannot believe you thought
you could get your way like that.

178
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,790
You were taking your lessons
diligently to become a queen.

179
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,660
I do not know what
suddenly changed your mind,

180
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:33,353
but I do not wish to know either.

181
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:37,294
Your fate was decided upon your birth.

182
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,024
You were to become
queen and serve your family.

183
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:43,434
That is your fate and the reason you exist.

184
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,910
Did you rise to your position on your own?

185
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,003
No, you did not.

186
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,243
That is why you cannot
step down on your own either.

187
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,274
If you want to die, die in the Palace.

188
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:58,619
I thought she said such things
because kids these days are...

189
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,920
too sheltered they make a
big deal out of small things.

190
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,983
That is why I did not give it much thought.

191
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:08,424
I never considered that she jumped
into the lake to commit suicide.

192
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,363
If she was willing to end her
life to avoid becoming queen,

193
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,393
her crazy behaviour today is also...

194
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,733
A way to step down from
her position as Queen.

195
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:24,034
If that is the case,

196
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,743
I will not let the Queen get away with it.

197
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:31,750
Wait for me! What if you fall?

198
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,513
I told you that you could take your time.

199
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,924
Who dares to block my way?

200
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,564
Grand Queen Dowager?

201
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:49,294
You will not be able to go home.

202
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,380
- What? - The Queen, Jang Bong Hwan,

203
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:56,674
has been ordered to stay here
forever until the day he rots,

204
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,544
and live in pain while being impotent.

205
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:10,414
No.

206
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,284
I don't want to.

207
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:18,694
I don't want to be impotent!

208
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,093
Your Highness!

209
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,463
What a terrible nightmare.

210
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:30,209
You tried to commit suicide in the lake...

211
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,880
and just now,
you fainted and I was so worried...

212
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,550
Calm down. I understand how you feel.

213
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,814
I am going to die with you!

214
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,500
That's enough already.

215
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,324
I've already reached the Max
amount of tears I can handle for a day.

216
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:53,424
It's not like it's contagious,
but how can you cry three times?

217
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,369
I ended up falling asleep
while waiting for you to stop.

218
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:59,664
Right. I am sure you do
not wish to see me cry.

219
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,633
You are pretty when you smile.

220
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,124
What about Court Lady Choi?

221
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:14,184
She insisted on bringing
your medicine herself.

222
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:18,900
Great Lord Yeongeun stayed by your side...

223
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:21,054
and returned home when the sun went down.

224
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:24,424
If you woke up a bit sooner,
you could have seen him.

225
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,024
Thank goodness I didn't see him.

226
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:28,723
Pardon?

227
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:30,709
If he finds out that a guy's soul...

228
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,664
is occupying his precious daughter's body,

229
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:34,463
he would be so upset.

230
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,709
Let's hurry before Court
Lady Choi comes back.

231
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,743
I'm sure the lake is filled now, right?

232
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:42,373
You want to go to the lake at this hour?

233
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,784
Today is finally the day.

234
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,623
- You are in a good mood now, right?
- Of course.

235
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,900
All I have left to do is to go back home...

236
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,824
and leave an afterglow of a handsome man.

237
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:58,654
Oh, right.

238
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:01,763
- Hong Yeon. - Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,963
I was able to endure this thanks to you.

240
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,304
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'll miss you.

241
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:11,603
Oh, that's right. I'll miss
Court Lady Choi too.

242
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:17,044
Hong Yeon. There's a will you
must leave for your descendants.

243
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,173
A will?

244
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,544
Buy land in Gangnam.

245
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,183
You have to tell them this.

246
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:25,014
If you leave it for about 200 years,

247
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,984
your future generations will live wealthy.

248
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:30,393
This is all I can give you.

249
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,064
Okay, let's go.

250
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:40,203
Your Highness. Please be careful.

251
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:42,274
Keep up your energy.

252
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,343
Hurry. You must hurry.

253
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:54,984
What is this?

254
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,554
Why did you go back to the old method...

255
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,200
when I created a perfect system for you?

256
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,324
The thing is...

257
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:03,754
The well has dried up.

258
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,839
That is why we have been
getting water from over there...

259
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:11,393
and bringing it over here, but...

260
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:15,264
Can you tell me that
again? I think I misheard you.

261
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:19,843
It sounds like you're telling me
you won't be able to fill it by today.

262
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,450
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

263
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,314
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.
- Please forgive us, Your Highness.

264
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:32,284
A high-ranking government
official must keep his promises.

265
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,629
You said you would fill the lake by today.

266
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,953
The closest well from here...

267
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,464
is still far away.

268
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:42,964
It will take at least a week and a half...

269
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,639
Please kill me!

270
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:51,379
- Please kill me! - Please kill me!

271
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:53,943
- Please kill me! - Please kill me!

272
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,074
Why do you guys always ask to be killed?

273
00:19:57,643 --> 00:20:00,484
Is it because you don't
believe I'll actually kill you?

274
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,560
Do you want me to show you
what behavioural integrity is?

275
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,153
Do you want to face the consequences
of depositing a fake check?

276
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:12,923
Forget it. I'm sure it will
still work even if it's not filled.

277
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:14,964
No, Your Highness.

278
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,534
Why are you acting like this too?

279
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:20,264
I will not allow you
to end your life again.

280
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,534
It's not like that.

281
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,510
I'm not trying to die.

282
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,974
Then what are you trying to do?

283
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,244
Well...

284
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,913
I'm trying to live. This
is the only way I can live!

285
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,383
You can go after you kill me first!

286
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:42,564
Gosh. How come you're so strong?

287
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:43,994
Let go of me.

288
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:45,940
If that granny changes her mind...

289
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:49,633
and gets rid of the water in
the lake again, I'm doomed!

290
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,839
Everyone, stop Her Highness!

291
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,440
How dare we touch Her Highness?

292
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,403
Your Highness!

293
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,804
Please no!

294
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,504
I will stop nagging you from now on!

295
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:02,990
I will never say no to you!

296
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:05,050
You cannot do this, Your Highness!

297
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:06,260
You said you wouldn't.

298
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,190
You said you wouldn't say no to me!

299
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:10,254
Darn it.

300
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,554
You cannot do that.

301
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:19,193
Even if you tickle me...

302
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:33,074
I have lost my ability
to laugh a long time ago.

303
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,913
Darn it.

304
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,744
I won't do it. Forget it.

305
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:40,143
Darn it.

306
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,584
Gosh. Darn it.

307
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:46,434
So you don't want me to go in there, right?

308
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,393
Fine.

309
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,034
Raise your head.

310
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,734
Straighten your back.

311
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,314
Can you swim?

312
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,123
Is that it?

313
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:24,730
If I go farther, the water will be deeper.

314
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,464
Okay. Go ahead.

315
00:22:32,294 --> 00:22:33,663
- Gosh. - Yes, that's it!

316
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,403
I slipped!

317
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:40,744
- Darn it. - Your Highness.

318
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:45,843
The Grand Queen Dowager asked
for your attendance immediately.

319
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,584
Darn it.

320
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:51,453
Lee Saeng Mang. That
name was my foreshadowing.

321
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,224
Darn it.

322
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,653
- My gosh. - Goodness. Nice.

323
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:57,393
Good.

324
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:01,224
What is wrong?

325
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,764
Do you get this kind of
feeling too from time to time?

326
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,834
You know, everyone is busy
doing something except for me.

327
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,673
You are the center of my world, my lord.

328
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,490
Well,
people who have great hunches like me...

329
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,744
sometimes get the wrong hunch like today.

330
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:25,353
I did not order Naengmyeon.

331
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,760
You give me the pleasure
of serving you every night.

332
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,024
It is from my heart.

333
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,300
Let me say something.

334
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,924
It might seem to you I am here to have fun,
but that is not true.

335
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:41,980
I am only here because I need
to find out the whereabouts...

336
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,774
of Lee Saeng Mang who had disappeared.

337
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,603
But why are you desperately
looking for that man?

338
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:52,520
I get the feeling that there is...

339
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,314
an important secret
behind his disappearance.

340
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:58,214
My sixth sense tells me...

341
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,224
that Lee Saeng Mang...

342
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:04,093
is at the center of the problem.

343
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:07,524
- What problem? - I do not know.

344
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:09,464
Pardon?

345
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:21,774
They are testing me right now.

346
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,744
- About today... - It is my fault.

347
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:34,484
For forcing you to marry
him when you did not want to.

348
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:37,593
Do you not want to be the Queen that badly?

349
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,764
Enough to throw away your own life?

350
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,569
Enough to be deposed as the Queen?

351
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:45,233
She tried to end her life because
she didn't want to be the Queen?

352
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:46,403
Fine.

353
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:49,234
As you desperately want it,
I will let you leave the palace.

354
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:51,703
I will depose you.

355
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,280
You will be stuck at your
house and never be able to...

356
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:57,143
set foot outside for the rest of your life.

357
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:58,349
No.

358
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,589
I can only go back through the lake here.

359
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:03,514
I do not remember it.

360
00:25:03,784 --> 00:25:06,554
I have not regained my
memories since falling into the lake.

361
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,524
You have not regained your memories,

362
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:11,153
but you remember that
you wanted to kill yourself?

363
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:14,693
I still have painful feelings.

364
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:17,763
And I am sure that I was the one
who embroidered the suicide note.

365
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:21,203
But I do not know why
I wanted to kill myself.

366
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,280
If you have not regained your memories,

367
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,274
why did you interfere?

368
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,673
As you cannot give me a reason,

369
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,550
I take that you just
wanted to go against me.

370
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,560
No.

371
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,260
I do not have any intention to oppose you.

372
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,623
Today,
you have directly challenged my authority.

373
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:41,554
I must get out of this.

374
00:25:41,883 --> 00:25:44,700
But I don't have a solution. Gosh,
I can't think of one.

375
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:47,923
And I cannot forgive you for it.

376
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:53,034
I deserve death, Your Highness.

377
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,834
You ought to end my life.

378
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:59,079
I am confused due to
the lack of my memories,

379
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:00,849
but I cannot turn my back on my family...

380
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,843
or my husband.

381
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,720
Please punish me...

382
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:09,514
with poison, so I can end this pain.

383
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:15,584
What they really want
isn't deposing the Queen.

384
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,773
Is it that easy for you
to give up on your life?

385
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:20,069
You jumped into the lake yourself.

386
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:21,613
And now, you want to drink the poison?

387
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,064
Why are you so weak?

388
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,004
They want to confirm that they
have power over the Queen.

389
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,139
My foolish decision to end my life...

390
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,234
caused this whole misunderstanding.

391
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,544
My action deserves death.

392
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:38,419
So I beg you to punish me with death,
Your Highness.

393
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,984
Your death will not fix anything.

394
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:42,389
The Queen Dowager will have...

395
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,659
an advantage over you
because of this incident.

396
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:46,859
But this goes beyond you.

397
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:50,653
This will be a disadvantage
against the entire Kim clan.

398
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:54,464
- I will try... - Please calm down.

399
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:04,173
I will ask this one last time,
Your Highness.

400
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,373
Do you truly want to leave the palace?

401
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,943
I want to...

402
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,584
live in the palace.

403
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,724
What do you think, Your Highness?

404
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:32,163
As I do not hold any old memories,
I have been born a new person.

405
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,304
I will become the perfect queen.

406
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:44,074
I do not believe promises
that come in words.

407
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:45,943
I will show you with my actions.

408
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,554
Please give her a chance, Your Highness.

409
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:54,883
Okay.

410
00:27:55,054 --> 00:27:58,393
I am truly grateful for your kindness.

411
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:02,264
I will never worry you from now on.

412
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,464
I am not worried.

413
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:09,379
("Desert your false self")

414
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:11,834
Because we do not have any weaknesses.

415
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:14,343
If there is a problem,

416
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:18,814
we can carve it out.

417
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:32,494
He meant it.

418
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:34,294
It's a real warning.

419
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,499
It's so dark.

420
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,469
Should I bring more lanterns,
Your Highness?

421
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,338
No. I was talking about my future.

422
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:08,649
Prince Yeongpyeong
raided the place with his men.

423
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:10,518
"His men"?

424
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:12,719
Were they royal guards?

425
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,288
They were specially trained.

426
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,518
How many?

427
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,489
Not many.

428
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:21,834
- Seven. - They have been training...

429
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:24,659
only seven men in hiding?

430
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,068
You are out of medicine.

431
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:33,909
You would've become the best
warrior if it weren't for the disease.

432
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,209
I'm grateful...

433
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,979
that I am alive due to your help.

434
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:40,048
Thank you, my lord.

435
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,618
If you fail once again no
matter what the reason is,

436
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:51,088
you will not get this medicine anymore.

437
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:53,328
I will keep that in mind.

438
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,139
So far, we thought...

439
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:15,278
the Queen fell into the lake to
frame Royal Noble Consort Eui.

440
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,118
We also thought she lied she lost
memories with an ulterior motive.

441
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:22,649
I cannot believe that she
tried to end her own life.

442
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:25,818
She might have planned all
this to win over you, Your Majesty.

443
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,534
She planned this as she expected
me to stand up for Consort Eui?

444
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,499
If you did not come forward,

445
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:34,268
she could have framed Her Highness.

446
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:35,999
If you did step up,

447
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,899
she could have persuaded you.

448
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,284
Prince Yeongpyeong, you assume...

449
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,625
everything the Queen says
and does is out of hidden malice.

450
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:48,808
The Queen...

451
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,278
is the core of the Kim clan.

452
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,949
What kind of people are they?

453
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:57,459
They are the ones that
killed our whole family.

454
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,018
I cannot...

455
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,828
forget it even for a moment.

456
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:06,969
I cannot forget it either.

457
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,628
But look at what the Queen
has chosen to do today.

458
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,814
She revealed the truth
for me who tried to kill her...

459
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,078
and Royal Noble Consort Eui
she came up against so much.

460
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:20,409
Do you still think your
unchanged hostility towards her...

461
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,778
is right?

462
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:28,689
- Your Majesty.
- If it is really a suicide attempt,

463
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,489
I killed the Queen twice.

464
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,965
Why are you here?

465
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:02,288
I have something to say.

466
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,659
You made things complicated for nothing.

467
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,989
My fate is already in your family's hands.

468
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,429
Just ask me to hand
over the letter next time.

469
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,028
Do you not like me...

470
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,514
because I'm from the Andong Kim clan?

471
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,268
I did not say I do not like you.

472
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,509
Do you like me then?

473
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,749
If I were not Andong Kim,

474
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:36,799
do you think you would have
seen me in a different light?

475
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,719
No, I would have not.

476
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,759
You became the Queen
because you are from the Kim clan.

477
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,929
I always tried my best.

478
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:49,108
I am not going to be crowned as
queen just because of my name.

479
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:52,338
I dedicated my whole
life to this yet people say...

480
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,878
You will get what you
wanted so bad tomorrow.

481
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,378
It is late and we have an
important event tomorrow.

482
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:03,949
Please go to your bed chamber now.

483
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:10,219
You should love me.

484
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,399
Is that an order?

485
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:28,608
My coldness pushed her into the lake.

486
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:34,078
If she tried to end her own
life because of your coldness,

487
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,829
she would have fallen
into the lake by herself.

488
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,725
But she manipulated the letter
and fell in front of Her Highness.

489
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:41,848
I see an ulterior motive.

490
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,018
"Motive", you say.

491
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:48,128
I should go to see the Queen.

492
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:51,929
The bad ones come with a smile.

493
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,798
If she did that to change my mind,

494
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:58,868
I would be able to tell by her attitude.

495
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,709
Please take care of Royal
Noble Consort Eui here.

496
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,259
Pretending to be a
perfect queen for 15 days.

497
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,269
Would I be able to stand it?

498
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:32,099
If it goes wrong, I'll be trapped
in a suffocating woman's body...

499
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,239
and imprisoned as a dethroned
queen in the suffocating Joseon era.

500
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,949
I dug my own grave. Who can I blame?

501
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,748
Your Highness, the King has come.

502
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:52,619
Of course, it's Cheoljong.
That punk needs to be blamed.

503
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,088
I wouldn't have stepped up
for her if he didn't act cool.

504
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,458
Open it.

505
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,228
Before that, I wouldn't have
done it if he was not incompetent.

506
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,575
Even before that,
this woman wouldn't have...

507
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,215
tried to commit suicide
if he was nice to her.

508
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,539
- No, even way before that... - My Queen.

509
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,409
How are you feeling?

510
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:17,248
You're that worried about me
and still put a sword to my neck?

511
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,358
There's not even one day I felt
comfortable after coming here.

512
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,564
As soon as I opened my eyes,
they said tomorrow is the wedding day.

513
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:28,429
My husband who sleeps under the
same blanket with me tries to kill me.

514
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,728
And even the family that was on
my side threatens to dethrone me.

515
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:34,805
What do you mean dethrone?

516
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:36,644
Why? Are you tempted?

517
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:40,544
It's a perfect opportunity to put
Jo Hwa Jin in my place, right?

518
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:42,668
Why are you so worked
up like a fighting cock?

519
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,108
I did not come to fight with you.

520
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:48,224
I get angry just by looking at your face.

521
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,385
Don't you think I would?

522
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:50,849
You who tried to kill me,

523
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,248
and your lover you would die for.

524
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:56,294
I'm about to die as I'm
trying to save you two.

525
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,158
Before I kill myself, they will
make me kill myself first at this rate.

526
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,319
If I don't get angry in this situation,

527
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,958
am I a human? I'd be Buddha!

528
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,374
You must have so many reasons
to get angry at me. I understand.

529
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:09,398
No.

530
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,168
Don't try to understand me.

531
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,144
Don't even say...

532
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:14,909
that you understand after all that.

533
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:18,838
You should've understood me...

534
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,949
before putting a sword to my neck.

535
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:25,818
No. You should've understood
this woman when she tried to...

536
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,818
kill herself on the night
before the wedding.

537
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:34,289
It's late. Your understanding
means nothing now.

538
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:39,099
Hey, get out. I'm too tired to get angry.

539
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,469
I will come back after your
emotions are stabilized.

540
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,938
Don't come unless you're
going to kneel and beg me.

541
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,878
I will come back.

542
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,579
I said don't come!

543
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,978
Are they filling the lake with water again?

544
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:38,188
Her Highness requested Grand Queen Dowager.

545
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,318
Why?

546
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:41,628
I do not know the reason,

547
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,704
but I heard Her Highness
was at the lake today...

548
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,829
to supervise it by herself.

549
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,278
Your Majesty.

550
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,449
I am sorry for worrying you.

551
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:14,958
I was afraid that I might lose you.

552
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,099
Are you hurt?

553
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:23,969
Your wound is more painful to me...

554
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,809
than mine.

555
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:31,679
Today...

556
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:35,449
was very cruel to you, Hwa Jin.

557
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,289
I am sorry for dragging
you into this trouble.

558
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:44,035
Thinking how lonely and
painful you must have been...

559
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,259
because of the troubles in the palace...

560
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:48,688
I did not call you to share my tragedy.

561
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,699
So never do that again.

562
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,898
If you sacrifice yourself to save me,

563
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,469
how can I stay sane?

564
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:02,168
I will never do something
that makes you afraid.

565
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,509
Until the situation is settled,

566
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,909
Prince Yeongpyeong himself will guard you.

567
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,519
How about O Wol?

568
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,219
- Well... - Special Director Hong has come.

569
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,489
Come in.

570
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,474
How is Royal Noble
Consort Eui's maid doing?

571
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,398
She is getting treatment
at Royal Infirmary.

572
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,298
My brother did so much for this.

573
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:32,539
Thank you.

574
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:38,608
Did you meet with the Queen?

575
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,224
Yes.

576
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,519
- How was she? - She was angry.

577
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,195
- Pardon? - She blamed me...

578
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,265
for my lack of affection
which forced her to end her life.

579
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,918
And she showed hatred
as I tried to kill her.

580
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,989
She exploded with her emotions.

581
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:55,564
To think that she did this to win me over,

582
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:57,059
her action does not make sense.

583
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:58,358
On top of that,

584
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,628
the Kim clan tried to depose her.

585
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,274
Moreover,
Kim Byeong In has not figured out...

586
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:07,639
that the piece of robe
belongs to Your Majesty.

587
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,168
I knew it.

588
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,009
The Queen remained silent about it.

589
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,818
I do not know what her intention is,

590
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:16,708
but it does seem the
Queen is acting on her own.

591
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,454
I thought I would be able to...

592
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:22,148
figure out what kind of
person she is by her decisions.

593
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,088
But she puzzles me even more.

594
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,805
Father, this is Byeong In.

595
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:36,068
Yes. Come in.

596
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,748
I thought you quit smoking.

597
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:50,949
I did.

598
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,119
I am sorry about today's incident.

599
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,128
Why would you apologize for it?

600
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,929
What do you plan to do?

601
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,075
I will try to talk some sense into her.

602
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,699
And if she fails to understand,
she will be gone.

603
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,869
Who are you referring to?

604
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,409
It could be anyone.

605
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,978
There is no such thing as an eternal ally.

606
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:27,748
I am afraid this is not the
right time to bring this up,

607
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,889
but I must tell you something.

608
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:31,958
Okay. Go ahead.

609
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:36,559
I have decided on the
magnitude of my dream.

610
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,259
I am happy to hear that.

611
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,128
Which position is it?

612
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,318
I will be the head of the
Department of Justice.

613
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,188
The head of the Department of Justice?

614
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:48,938
Is being a warrior all
you want for your dream?

615
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,278
I will start from a position
where I can handle...

616
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:54,248
and make my own path.

617
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:55,909
Is that so?

618
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,949
You are saying,
you want to make your own path?

619
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,559
The Royal Noble Consort Eui is here.

620
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:16,628
Do not move.

621
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:24,539
Your Highness.

622
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:31,519
I am sorry.

623
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,989
I should have resisted to the end.

624
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,458
Your busted knees are the proof.

625
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:40,728
I know.

626
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,199
They are nothing.

627
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,028
With the medicinal herbs for a few days,

628
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,668
I will be able to run in no time.

629
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:53,869
Yes. I am sure you will recover.

630
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,809
Who would hurt you so brutally like this?

631
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:01,778
I could not see anything
as he was wearing a mask.

632
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:05,349
But I do remember his voice.

633
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,748
Your Highness.

634
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,269
Please excuse me for saying this.

635
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,189
When people who are not
from the royal family get hurt,

636
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:15,028
they cannot stay in the palace.

637
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:18,398
But how could she leave
the palace in this state?

638
00:43:18,728 --> 00:43:20,568
That is the custom of the palace.

639
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:24,099
Everything from here shows no compassion.

640
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,778
If anyone tries...

641
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,579
to harm you on your way out,
use this as a bribe.

642
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,818
Once you get out of the palace,

643
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,794
use this to keep you comfortable.

644
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,489
No. This is too much.

645
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:44,418
I will send a letter to my family.

646
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,219
Do not worry.

647
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,298
Thank you for your service.

648
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,869
I am too ashamed to face Lord Jo.

649
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,168
I cannot go.

650
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,869
O Wol, you and I have grown up together.

651
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:05,608
You are my family.

652
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,108
You must hang in there,

653
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,278
for me to do the same.

654
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:13,918
Be more courageous for me.

655
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,119
You must live.

656
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,559
Do this for me.

657
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:52,164
- What happened? - It was crazy yesterday.

658
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,389
The Queen...

659
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,528
My lord.

660
00:44:58,628 --> 00:44:59,858
Did you hear?

661
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,474
High Majesty threw daggers with
his eyes at Grand Queen Dowager.

662
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:04,898
His eyes got so big.

663
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:08,269
Hey. You.

664
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,378
His Majesty lifted her in
front of the Queen and...

665
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,754
Royal Chef, did you hear?

666
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:21,318
His Majesty held the sword
and the Grand Queen Dowager...

667
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:25,865
Did you hear what happened
at Donggungjeon Hall?

668
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,329
I heard they do that all the time.

669
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,108
The head of the Department of
Justice will be appointed today.

670
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,809
"Will be"?

671
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:51,248
We have a request of an appointment.

672
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,354
Who has been recommended...

673
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,949
to be the head of the
Department of Justice?

674
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:59,019
It is Byeong In of the Andong Kim clan.

675
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,398
That is quite a surprise.

676
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,204
I am sure there are many candidates
in the Department of Justice.

677
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,945
If I appoint someone who has
passed the civil service exam...

678
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,474
as the head of the Department of Justice,

679
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,245
there will be complaints.
Do you not think so?

680
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:18,239
We unanimously agreed
on this recommendation.

681
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:21,608
"Unanimously"?

682
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:26,679
I did not expect such
harmony among my people.

683
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:31,719
As I have heard,
he must be an excellent individual.

684
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:39,199
The royal notice of appointment
has already been prepared?

685
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:44,139
To catch up with your swift
decisions as I am a slow king,

686
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,838
perhaps, I should cut down on my sleep.

687
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,168
Please do not say so.

688
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:52,079
You must take care of your
health and produce an heir.

689
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,108
He is no king. He is a breeding horse.

690
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:17,539
You are always humble.
Please do not lose your humility.

691
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:20,469
Yes, Your Highness.

692
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,925
The Pungyang Jo clan...

693
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,265
has brought this disaster upon ourselves.

694
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,449
Because of Royal Noble
Consort Eui's false confession,

695
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,559
we have suffered such a humiliation.

696
00:47:47,128 --> 00:47:50,769
The failure is the cause, not the result.

697
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:52,338
Pardon?

698
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,469
That is what the Queen Dowager said.

699
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,385
We agreed on the
appointment of Kim Byeong In...

700
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,409
and helped them
reinforce their tradition...

701
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:03,648
because we lost.

702
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,818
More defeats will decrease
our chance of winning.

703
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,449
She said...

704
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:11,989
we must make the move first.

705
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,076
Do you think O Wol
was able to recover a bit?

706
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,853
I will look into how she is doing.

707
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,893
She is a lively girl,
so she is always running around.

708
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,694
She will never be able to run around again.

709
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:54,304
If she had not come
to the palace with me...

710
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:58,333
Do not think too much about it.

711
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:00,744
Sometimes, thinking can put you in a swamp.

712
00:49:01,744 --> 00:49:04,304
The more struggle, the deeper
you fall. It will be more painful.

713
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:07,884
What do you do...

714
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,753
to clear your head when
you have a lot on your mind?

715
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:12,614
I...

716
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:15,853
go to Special Director Hong.

717
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,623
He can comfort you.

718
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:21,163
He is so silly.

719
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:23,963
When I am with him, he makes me angry.

720
00:49:24,563 --> 00:49:25,864
And when I vent my anger on him,

721
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,003
I am out of the swamp before I notice it.

722
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:37,474
Then can you make me angry?

723
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:42,143
- That is... - Or...

724
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,333
You must not move.

725
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:55,183
I have finished.

726
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:01,264
What is wrong?

727
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:04,293
It is nothing.

728
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,103
Did you get hurt?

729
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:13,433
You must not touch me.

730
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:20,413
I have a cramp.

731
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:25,130
Has it been that long?

732
00:51:25,154 --> 00:51:26,284
Thank goodness.

733
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:30,083
You focused so hard
that you forgot the time.

734
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:47,880
If you wanted to sew,
you should do it in Daejojeon Hall.

735
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,074
Why are you doing it in the royal kitchen?

736
00:51:56,244 --> 00:51:58,554
But are you really sewing something?

737
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:04,224
I promised to be reborn
as the perfect queen.

738
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,563
Did you say perfect?

739
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,563
You must be free. Do you
want me to give you some work?

740
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,163
Oh, my back.

741
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:16,864
When will I finish all of this?

742
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:20,174
What happened?

743
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:25,143
- Come in. - Wait.

744
00:52:34,683 --> 00:52:36,800
Is that from Tongmyeongjeon Hall?

745
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,224
- Yes, Your Highness. - Let me see.

746
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,439
Since she has tasted
a new dish that I made,

747
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,863
I'm sure she's tired of the same
old meals she used to have.

748
00:52:59,873 --> 00:53:01,884
Okay. Bring this to the saboksi.

749
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:05,729
If they cover the food palanquin
with a cloth about this size,

750
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:07,360
it will prevent the food from getting cold.

751
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,200
Tell them to make it nicely.

752
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:10,284
All right.

753
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:15,924
Are you going to the
lake after sending me off?

754
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:17,499
Have you seen anyone who...

755
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:19,323
work so hard like this
when they want to die?

756
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:21,854
Also, you must've forgotten
because it's become so natural,

757
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:23,733
but I'm being watched by a CCTV.

758
00:53:32,674 --> 00:53:34,284
What are you worried about?

759
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:43,523
Now, shall I try to work my magic?

760
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:53,963
Your Highness!

761
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,264
Yes!

762
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:07,813
Your Highness!

763
00:54:08,514 --> 00:54:10,384
Hey, you. Is the ground meat ready?

764
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:11,853
Yes.

765
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:13,784
Hurry up and bring it over.

766
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:17,224
Bring me some salt.

767
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:19,454
The Queen wants me
to bring this to her first.

768
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,034
My goodness.

769
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,574
Fine. Do whatever you want.

770
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,373
Let me see how well things work out.

771
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:47,482
What if we asked the
Queen to prepare a meal...

772
00:54:49,883 --> 00:54:53,093
Grand Queen Dowager,
this is the Head Inspector.

773
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:57,223
The Queen has prepared lunch for you.

774
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:03,232
Should I tell him not to bring it in?

775
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:07,433
Goodness.

776
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:08,973
What is it?

777
00:55:11,002 --> 00:55:13,613
She is so tactless.

778
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:17,513
Your Highness.

779
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:21,223
Your lunch has arrived, but...

780
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:27,393
(Tongmyeongjeon Hall)

781
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:36,832
Be careful.

782
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:42,703
That is...

783
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,763
The Queen has told me that...

784
00:56:10,902 --> 00:56:16,372
the theme of today's lunch is COSI.

785
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:19,513
"COSI"?

786
00:56:20,973 --> 00:56:23,082
I have never heard this before.

787
00:56:23,343 --> 00:56:24,513
Is it from Mencius?

788
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:27,953
No, it is not. Is it from "The
Analects of Confucius"?

789
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,053
It means that...

790
00:56:30,422 --> 00:56:34,069
the food is crunchy on the outside...

791
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:35,893
and soft in the inside.

792
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,363
Oh, really?

793
00:56:49,602 --> 00:56:50,682
The food palanquin is here!

794
00:57:03,622 --> 00:57:05,493
Here. Take the dishes.

795
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:10,922
Be careful.

796
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,303
Your Highness.

797
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,703
She was very satisfied,
and she complimented you.

798
00:57:21,102 --> 00:57:23,848
In particular,
she saw the food palanquin...

799
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:25,992
and asked how you came
up with such a brilliant idea.

800
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:27,913
Of course. That's an obvious result.

801
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,982
It's an item that was successful
in the competitive nation of Korea.

802
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,152
Josean's deliveryman.

803
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:40,122
I'm so proud of myself.

804
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:43,768
Generally speaking,
a woman of the royal family...

805
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:44,869
must always be humble...

806
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:45,933
Are you...

807
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:48,033
going to nag me right now?

808
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:53,372
Must they be humble? It was a question.

809
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:57,303
No. Life is hard even if
you live off your own pride.

810
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:02,812
I do not know what she is saying,
but it is still annoying.

811
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:08,029
It is a stroke of good luck
in the midst of misfortune...

812
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:09,723
that O Wol was able to survive.

813
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:14,422
I am sure this experience
has made you more aware...

814
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:17,422
of what kind of people the Kim clan are.

815
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,962
I had no idea they would go this far.

816
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,303
I am sure you are scared and in shock.

817
00:58:23,502 --> 00:58:26,303
However, this is just the beginning.

818
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:32,542
They never give up the game they missed.

819
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:38,453
They said the late king did
not die because of his disease.

820
00:58:40,582 --> 00:58:41,622
Then...

821
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:48,122
He thought the Kim clan is ruining Joseon.

822
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,098
Do you know your sin?

823
00:58:51,122 --> 00:58:52,768
He dragged down Kim Hong Geun in power...

824
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:54,292
and exiled him.

825
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:57,402
He revised the law on bribery.

826
00:58:58,533 --> 00:58:59,679
He stood up...

827
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,442
against the Kim clan like that.

828
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:06,312
But they are not the kind of people
who would sit back and watch.

829
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:13,359
Fortunately,

830
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,622
he avoided a misfortune...

831
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:19,323
and was finding evidence
to reveal the people behind it.

832
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:30,002
After the late King had passed away,

833
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,902
his food taster disappeared.

834
00:59:33,372 --> 00:59:35,042
He must have been poisoned.

835
00:59:36,502 --> 00:59:38,219
If we had moved more quickly,

836
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:40,442
he would have been alive.

837
00:59:42,283 --> 00:59:45,613
I told you. It is not late for you yet.

838
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,823
But if you miss this moment,
it is too late.

839
00:59:49,883 --> 00:59:52,292
It was a court maid called O Wol this time.

840
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,522
But it will be you next time.

841
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:58,792
I will make appeals.

842
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:01,933
To request to dethrone the Queen.

843
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,272
You do not have to do anything.

844
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:08,243
The King will like it that way.

845
01:00:08,643 --> 01:00:11,643
All you need to do is to approve it.

846
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:20,652
Queen Dowager, please forgive me.

847
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,823
But I need your help.

848
01:00:30,062 --> 01:00:34,133
All you need to care
about is the King's heart.

849
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:39,402
The King will see the Queen
in a different light after this.

850
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:42,042
Without knowing her ill intention.

851
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:50,513
The weather is gloomy today. It might rain.

852
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:51,982
Court Lady Han.

853
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:55,152
The room is dark. Light the candles.

854
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,683
Yes, Your Highness.

855
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,352
You will not see His Majesty tonight.

856
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:28,783
Why are you...

857
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:32,152
Will you be satisfied only
after taking everything I have?

858
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,863
Did you change the content of the letter?

859
01:01:37,263 --> 01:01:39,263
You changed something
that is even more important.

860
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:41,393
Why can I not change such a thing?

861
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:46,673
I am not sure what you are talking about.

862
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:51,712
I know your lies.

863
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:58,513
If His Majesty knows the truth I know,

864
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:02,352
you will understand me.

865
01:02:03,622 --> 01:02:06,393
The feeling when your loved
one is looking at you with despise.

866
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:07,922
How cruel it is...

867
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:11,863
to see those eyes...

868
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:15,203
for the rest of your life.

869
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:26,372
If you want to keep the lie,
leave the palace.

870
01:02:28,643 --> 01:02:30,582
You found my weakness.

871
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:34,183
Reveal the truth to the King.

872
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:37,922
But you will have to
reveal another truth as well.

873
01:02:40,053 --> 01:02:41,192
That you...

874
01:02:42,462 --> 01:02:44,022
tried to kill His Majesty.

875
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,172
You know everything.

876
01:02:56,843 --> 01:02:57,973
You...

877
01:02:59,473 --> 01:03:01,073
can not do anything.

878
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,223
I swear...

879
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:12,053
you will also lose someone dear to you.

880
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:53,893
What is the matter?

881
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:58,533
You know it as well.

882
01:03:59,573 --> 01:04:00,672
His Majesty...

883
01:04:01,902 --> 01:04:03,843
is weak when he feels guilty.

884
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:07,553
It is what you have to pay for surviving.

885
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:09,743
It is what guilt is.

886
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:20,192
Did you go this far just
to win the King's heart?

887
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:39,119
Hurry and take them in before they get wet.

888
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:40,413
Hurry and take them in.

889
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:47,582
The cloud looked unusual
for the last few days.

890
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:49,723
It is finally raining.

891
01:04:51,323 --> 01:04:53,893
My rank in this life is higher
than my rank in the real life.

892
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:57,292
But why is my life more miserable?

893
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:58,509
Your Highness.

894
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:02,462
Do you think I have this
life and the next life too?

895
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:06,832
According to the parallel universe theory,
it's possible.

896
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:12,720
Here.

897
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:15,082
This is our current life.

898
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:18,652
This is another life, Okay?

899
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,913
It is freaking difficult.

900
01:05:23,183 --> 01:05:25,168
The way she speaks...

901
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:27,553
became weird hanging out with the Queen.

902
01:05:28,562 --> 01:05:33,033
Do you think this puppy was
also a human in the past life?

903
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,232
It's possible.

904
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,363
That Mr. Fool over there too?

905
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:44,143
Sure. He would've done
anything I asked him to do.

906
01:05:45,343 --> 01:05:46,812
How about me?

907
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:52,482
You will always be Court Lady Choi.

908
01:05:53,752 --> 01:05:55,482
Hong Yeon, you...

909
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:58,569
Do you think my parents...

910
01:05:58,593 --> 01:06:00,692
will have a comfortable
life in their other life?

911
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:01,899
What?

912
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:05,438
My mother has four fingernails only.

913
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,763
She lost her fingernails while
picking out stones in cold winter.

914
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:13,473
In her other life,
she would have ten fingernails, right?

915
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:17,248
Yes, right.

916
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:19,312
My father's eye would be perfectly fine,
too.

917
01:06:19,613 --> 01:06:20,872
What happened to your father?

918
01:06:21,212 --> 01:06:23,712
- He was whipped with a pitchfork. - What?

919
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:25,659
He must have borrowed
rice to fulfill the military duty...

920
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:27,453
and have not paid the interest.

921
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:30,453
They need to threaten people
to make them pay it back.

922
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:34,523
One out of every two households
has someone that is disabled like that.

923
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:37,493
Don't worry.

924
01:06:37,663 --> 01:06:40,538
In their other life, all your
mother's fingernails are so shiny...

925
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:42,078
that she doesn't need
to get her nails done.

926
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:43,578
Your father's eyes...

927
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:46,573
are sparkling as if he's
wearing coloured contacts.

928
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:52,042
I want to see my mother
with ten pretty fingernails.

929
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:53,872
(Pouty)

930
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:56,982
Me too.

931
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,852
I want to see my mom.

932
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:05,652
You do not even know your mother's face.

933
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:07,192
Oh, no.

934
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:10,522
Why did you bring up her mom?

935
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:14,138
I mean, it's another mom.

936
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:16,862
I was talking about Lady Lee
Soon Shin who is alive and healthy.

937
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:20,379
She's even doing Zumba for fun these days.

938
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,083
Why are you making me feel like an orphan?

939
01:07:27,773 --> 01:07:29,588
Gathering at the royal kitchen
where women are forbidden...

940
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,582
and whining like that.

941
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:34,252
I cannot understand women.

942
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:39,693
Mother?

943
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:43,322
Mom.

944
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:59,773
It's raining and sentimental.

945
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,443
Hey. Bring me some pajeon and makgeoli.

946
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:06,489
You should go to Daejojeon Hall quickly.

947
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:08,313
The rain is not going to stop for a while.

948
01:08:10,122 --> 01:08:11,329
How do you know?

949
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,728
Are you a supercomputer from
the Meteorological Administration?

950
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,922
I do not understand
what you are talking about,

951
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:18,869
but given my wrist hurts like this again,

952
01:08:18,893 --> 01:08:21,063
it will rain heavily overnight.

953
01:08:23,662 --> 01:08:24,903
How heavy will it be?

954
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,403
I am not sure.

955
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,718
If it hurts this much,
it will pour buckets...

956
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:35,912
for a good several hours at least.

957
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:38,983
Pouring buckets?

958
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:42,983
Then the lakes and wells
will be filled with water?

959
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:57,462
Head Eunuch.

960
01:08:58,672 --> 01:08:59,803
Yes, Your Majesty.

961
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,249
("Changes of Zhou")

962
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,473
To focus on the consecutive bed-sharing,

963
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,412
I want to go to my bed
chamber after reading more.

964
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:11,983
It is late. You may leave first.

965
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:13,683
Yes, Your Majesty.

966
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:24,693
("Wubei Zhi")

967
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:55,539
I will come back after your
emotions are stabilized.

968
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:58,492
Don't come unless you're
going to kneel and beg me.

969
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,992
I said don't come!

970
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,672
I knee every day,

971
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:19,282
but I did not kneel
before the person I should.

972
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:29,862
Your Highness!

973
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:32,733
You are going to catch a cold!

974
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:34,739
Catching a cold is nothing!

975
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,838
When the sky is helping me like this!

976
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:39,072
Oh, my, Your Highness. You cannot do this!

977
01:10:39,933 --> 01:10:42,172
Please come to your senses.

978
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,449
Your Highness.

979
01:11:15,473 --> 01:11:16,672
Your Highness?

980
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:19,088
Once again.

981
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:20,513
What are you saying, Your Highness?

982
01:11:20,672 --> 01:11:22,659
Okay! Yes! This is great!

983
01:11:22,683 --> 01:11:23,843
Your Highness.

984
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:26,153
What is that, Your Highness?

985
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:34,593
What kind of woman is she?

986
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:37,393
She is so unpredictable.

987
01:11:37,763 --> 01:11:39,893
Oh, yes! Okay!

988
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,662
What is the matter, Your Highness?

989
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:47,603
Why are you alone unlike usual?

990
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,752
Did you come out to get rained on too?

991
01:12:00,313 --> 01:12:02,483
I came to apologize to you.

992
01:12:04,282 --> 01:12:05,952
Never mind. I don't care anymore.

993
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:07,252
No.

994
01:12:07,593 --> 01:12:09,593
I cannot turn a blind eye like this.

995
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:11,962
I said never mind. Why are you so clingy?

996
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:13,933
"Clingy"?

997
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:18,702
I'm a simple person.

998
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:20,352
I curse when I'm glad to see someone,

999
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,473
and I pick a fight when I'm thankful.

1000
01:12:22,742 --> 01:12:24,343
I hate sweet talkers so,

1001
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:25,943
get lost.

1002
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:31,643
"Get lost"?

1003
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:34,088
I gathered my courage to apologize,

1004
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:36,082
and that is the only thing you can say?

1005
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:39,199
Hey. If it's up to a person
who apologizes and...

1006
01:12:39,223 --> 01:12:41,952
not a person who is apologized to,
is it an apology?

1007
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:48,662
But there are rules for the royal family.

1008
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,502
Until when are you going to
speak in a weird way like that?

1009
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,172
Until today. Just until today.

1010
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:59,888
Everything will be back
to its place tomorrow!

1011
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:02,659
Yes! Ah, yes!

1012
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:04,489
Your Highness.

1013
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,383
- Ah, yes! - Your Highness!

1014
01:13:06,712 --> 01:13:08,383
Yes!

1015
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,468
Your Highness! Please come to your senses.

1016
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:14,723
Yes!

1017
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:20,832
I cannot share a bed with you today
because you have hurt my feelings.

1018
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:25,103
Sleep by yourself tonight.

1019
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,803
Oh, yes! I'm so happy to hear that!

1020
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:34,773
That was a smooth move.

1021
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:42,493
Did you come out without an umbrella?

1022
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:45,223
It feels great to get rained
on like this sometimes.

1023
01:13:45,693 --> 01:13:48,962
It feels like it washes
all the worries away.

1024
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:54,069
Don't feel sad.

1025
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:55,563
Your Highness, will you go inside?

1026
01:13:56,202 --> 01:13:58,808
Oh, my goodness. Your Highness!

1027
01:13:58,832 --> 01:14:00,072
Please!

1028
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,178
What is it? Why is it
thundering at this very moment?

1029
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:05,872
The sky is enraged!

1030
01:14:06,973 --> 01:14:08,313
Be enraged!

1031
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:12,183
Be enraged by my pelvic
movements and pour it more!

1032
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:16,098
Your Highness! You cannot do that!

1033
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:17,999
Oh, yes!

1034
01:14:18,023 --> 01:14:19,122
Please!

1035
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,369
Your Highness!

1036
01:14:21,393 --> 01:14:23,768
The Queen's mental illness
is getting worse every day.

1037
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,733
She tries to end her
own life at every chance.

1038
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,832
The core of the Internal Court is shaking.

1039
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:33,508
Would it not be right...

1040
01:14:33,532 --> 01:14:35,103
to petition for dethroning the Queen?

1041
01:14:35,742 --> 01:14:38,548
- You are right. - Yes.

1042
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,242
It is time for the Pungyang Jo clan...

1043
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,513
to gather strength.

1044
01:14:58,822 --> 01:15:00,982
They have shown their
vulnerable neck in front of you.

1045
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,903
You must bite it off.

1046
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:11,702
The core of the Internal
Court is in danger.

1047
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:15,313
Dethroning the Queen
is the right thing to do.

1048
01:15:24,422 --> 01:15:27,193
There was an immortal
being called Achilles.

1049
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:29,338
But the heel was his only vulnerable spot.

1050
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:31,822
They say he died from
an arrow in that heel.

1051
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:34,933
That's the origin of the expression,
"Achilles' heel".

1052
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:37,709
The actual reason behind his death...

1053
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,848
is that there was no artisan
to make armour boots for him.

1054
01:15:40,872 --> 01:15:42,279
They say...

1055
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:45,718
We might've not needed each
other if we didn't have a weakness.

1056
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:48,119
Avoiding danger...

1057
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:51,313
We're each other's weaknesses,
dragging each other to our misery.

1058
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:57,422
But we also make up for each
other's weakness and save each other.

1059
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:21,172
Hong Yeon.

1060
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:24,513
You must keep my will
to buy land in Gangnam.

1061
01:16:24,643 --> 01:16:26,813
Yes, Your Highness.

1062
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:30,122
Court Lady Choi.

1063
01:16:31,122 --> 01:16:32,822
You went through a lot because of me.

1064
01:17:02,383 --> 01:17:03,523
Finally.

1065
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:11,563
(Choondangji Lake)

1066
01:17:26,072 --> 01:17:28,912
(I came here for nothing. Jang Bong Hwan)

1067
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,432
I should write something to celebrate.

1068
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:57,572
Now, everything will go
back to where it should be.

1069
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:52,630
(Mr. Queen)

1070
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:53,869
(This drama is fictional
and all characters, families, )

1071
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:56,253
(dynasties, and events are
unrelated to historical events.)

1072
01:20:11,572 --> 01:20:13,819
The Queen is the most
eccentric and strange person...

1073
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,018
I have met in my entire life.

1074
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:18,289
As if she has come from a different world.

1075
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,688
Whose soul are you trying to call upon?

1076
01:20:20,712 --> 01:20:24,228
Then I'm sure this woman
has completely lost her mind.

1077
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,699
The internal crisis is more dangerous...

1078
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:28,598
than the crisis from outside,
do you not agree?

1079
01:20:28,622 --> 01:20:29,838
You are saying,
there is an internal crisis...

1080
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:31,069
that was not there before.

1081
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,138
That means...

1082
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:33,638
The interest that His Majesty
has towards the Queen...

1083
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,593
will end up becoming our weakness.

1084
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:38,702
Then today will be our first day together.

1085
01:20:38,903 --> 01:20:39,903
What?

1086
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:41,927
