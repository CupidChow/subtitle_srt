1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,610
(This drama is purely fictional. The characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,170
(Grand Finale)

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,730
Stop

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,700
Search

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,420
yes

6
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,300
No abnormality

7
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,500
arrive

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,160
All the carriages carrying tribute must be carefully checked.

9
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,370
yes

10
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,410
Niangniang

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,730
Duxelles

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
Your Highness

13
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,660
Finally caught you

14
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,170
This mouse

15
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,460
What time does the ceremony start?

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,170
Noon

17
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,520
That's still early.

18
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,280
You can't relax either.

19
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,400
Let's go

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,010
Wait a moment

21
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:12,946
What are you doing?

22
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:14,766
I don't know either

23
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,716
There is still some time.

24
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:25,736
I really have to go now

25
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,520
(Episode 20 I'm missing my own life)

26
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,970
Your Highness

27
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,270
Wait a minute, I haven't sorted it out yet.

28
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,400
Oh my god

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,840
Your Highness

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,640
How unwilling are you?

31
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,490
Still wandering in the nine springs

32
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,340
Your Highness

33
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,640
Shangshan

34
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,590
Come with me

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,730
Together

36
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,140
Get out of here!

37
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,480
Your Highness

38
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,540
You go with peace of mind

39
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,000
Come with me

40
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,000
Niangniang

41
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,300
Your Highness

42
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,760
Your Highness

43
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,000
Are you still alive?

44
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,750
Shhh

45
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,180
Your Highness

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,700
what is going on

47
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,340
This dragon robe suits you very well.

48
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,750
It's me indeed.

49
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,990
Over there

50
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,410
Over there

51
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,440
hateful

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Oh Yes

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,470
How do you throw so accurately?

54
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,710
Um

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,260
A trick that has been practiced for a long time

56
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,810
What has been

57
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm a knife wielder.

58
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,510
oh

59
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,610
Don't do useless work

60
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,370
How many soldiers are there in the palace now?

61
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,240
Too late

62
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,610
That's the sound of the ceremony starting.

63
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,460
How dare you speak plainly to me?

64
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,180
So early

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Kneel

66
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,370
Four prostrations

67
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,040
rise

68
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,880
They actually held the ceremony in advance

69
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,890
Let me tell you

70
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,450
Um

71
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,430
I prepared in advance just in case

72
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,230
What are you doing? Hurry up and get on with it.

73
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,610
How come?

74
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,820
The seal is missing

75
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,300
There is no jade seal inside

76
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,360
I'm crazy

77
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,730
Because of that sentence

78
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,150
My heart is warming up again

79
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,350
Lift your head

80
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
Greetings to you for the first time

81
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,390
The Queen

82
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,920
mother

83
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,080
Li Shengli

84
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,830
Aren't you Li Shengli?

85
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,970
You're crazy

86
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,720
still

87
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,370
Or am I crazy?

88
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,030
Steal the Imperial Seal

89
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,440
Haven't I always been crazy?

90
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
Then we still have a chance

91
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,990
Let's go

92
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,420
Um

93
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,640
It went smoothly last time.

94
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,500
Please open it quickly.

95
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Shut up, it's so noisy

96
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
You really are

97
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,140
grown ups

98
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,650
Is it you again?

99
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,200
I told you not to come here.

100
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,460
Really

101
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,300
No one to ask

102
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,500
I was entrusted by the Queen Mother

103
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,690
I stole something.

104
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,560
This dazzling and noble thing

105
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,410
It doesn't feel auspicious.

106
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,690
What is that?

107
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,370
Imperial Seal

108
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,260
You now

109
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,760
Where did you go after stealing the imperial seal?

110
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,910
That's the Yijinfu.

111
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,700
I am here now

112
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,070
Have you fallen into a trap?

113
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,710
What to do for me

114
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,190
What You Do Here

115
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,610
I came to see my friends

116
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,270
Can't

117
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,440
Please get out immediately

118
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,700
Stop

119
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,130
How dare you touch my loved ones without permission?

120
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,060
You are crazy

121
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,900
How can I take out the imperial seal?

122
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,210
Imperial Seal

123
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,360
Do you want to see it?

124
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,900
There is a bomb

125
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,220
Run away

126
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,390
Thanks for your hard work

127
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,470
Breaking through Hanyang

128
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,770
Are the gates of the capital about to be breached?

129
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,490
yes

130
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,120
Please order the troops to go out

131
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,910
first

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
The top priority is to successfully complete the inauguration ceremony.

133
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,600
You guys wait for orders first

134
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,090
Soldiers are mobilized to guard the gates of each city

135
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,920
Go

136
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,060
Just wait until the ceremony is over

137
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,280
I will catch you all

138
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,370
How can we hold the ceremony without the imperial seal?

139
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh

140
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,690
How could this happen?

141
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,880
Brother, what on earth did you do?

142
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,460
You are of no use at all

143
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,300
What is it?

144
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,820
so what

145
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,100
Now because of that

146
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,080
The blinding smoke of unknown origin

147
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,670
It's not convenient for us to attack

148
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,160
In order to carry out the ceremony smoothly

149
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,550
I will send soldiers to guard the gates of the capital.

150
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,780
Making a feint to the east and attacking in the west

151
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,370
(Feint to the east and attack in the west:
Make a noise in the east, and then attack the west to disrupt the operation)
Making a feint to the east and attacking in the west

152
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,530
(Feint to the east and attack in the west:
Make a noise in the east, and then attack the west to disrupt the operation)

153
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,580
What's wrong
(Feint to the east and attack in the west:
Make a noise in the east, and then attack the west to disrupt the operation)

154
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,940
(Feint to the east and attack in the west:
Make a noise in the east, and then attack the west to disrupt the operation)

155
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,550
nothing

156
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,030
I will go find the seal myself.

157
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,260
Go and call the soldiers back to the palace immediately.

158
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,600
What

159
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,490
Didn't you hear?

160
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,160
yes

161
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,680
How can it be so empty?

162
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,140
It seems that the outside diversion was very successful.

163
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,130
Finally got here

164
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,640
Are you nervous?

165
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,240
Nervous and

166
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,530
Excited

167
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,550
good

168
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,190
This is just before the game ends.

169
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,270
The feeling of facing the big boss

170
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,600
That's right, Big Boss

171
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,680
If you can't beat the big boss, you will die.

172
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,990
Who doesn't swear?

173
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,650
Play from the beginning

174
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,840
We only have one chance

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,350
Nervous?

176
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,830
let's go

177
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,080
Caught

178
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,550
nave

179
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,510
I'm fine

180
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,330
I was just frightened by the sound.

181
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't feel any pain at all

182
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,420
nave

183
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,910
nave

184
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,320
Don't move, Central Hall

185
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,430
Are you going to stop the coronation ceremony?

186
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,920
The nave is more important

187
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,350
Stop the bleeding first

188
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,110
Lord

189
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,160
Are you going back?

190
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,080
No reason why it's now

191
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,700
Please

192
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,390
Let me see him alive

193
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
Just take a look

194
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,200
My Body

195
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,580
Is it back?

196
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,180
Where is Cheoljong?

197
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,650
You can't save him.

198
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,350
But how could I save him? That was two hundred years ago.

203
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,130
stop

204
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,560
You can't run like that, Jang Bong-hwan

205
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,070
Zhang Fenghuan

206
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,450
Over there

Jang Bong-hwan stops

209
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,490
Catch Him

210
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,340
Catch Him

211
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,280
How can you run so fast, you bastard?

212
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,790
Really

213
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,880
Hello

214
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,750
Itâ€™s great to be young

215
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,330
Has he really been a vegetable these past few months?

He disappeared

224
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,420
Your Highness

225
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,380
Your Highness

226
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,060
You can't just leave like this. Wake up, Your Highness.

227
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,020
Your Highness

228
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,480

I'm fine

232
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,660
Your Highness, you shed a lot of blood.

233
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,830
I feel like I'm dying of pain.

234
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,970
It seems that he will not die

235
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,910
This bulletproof vest saved both of us.

236
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,160
Thanks

237
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,280
What are you doing?

238
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,720
A king is actually in cahoots with the Eastern Bandits

239
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,540
I seem

240
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,760
Still a king

241
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,970
Why don't you just stay still?

242
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,870
If you are content with your position

243
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,920
Stay still

244
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,850

Please

255
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,950
Kill me

256
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,780
Live

257
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,340
Let you live in a world like hell

258

It's the punishment given to you.

259
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,120
If you dare to kill yourself

260
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,790
I will save you no matter what.

I'll keep you company too.

Only the body is alive

264
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,900
What is it like?

265
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,680
It will be unforgettable

266
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,910

267
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,950
Hiding in the crowd is what you do best

A no-travel order has been issued

269
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,460
So there is not even an ant in the street

270
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,790
you

271
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,740
Nowhere to hide

272
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,070
nave

273
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,730
Your Highness, please end this battle.

274
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,370
Can't

275
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,270
There is nothing more important than the nave.

276
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,030
Don't worry, I'll overcome it too.

277
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,120
Your Highness

278
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,320
hurry up

279
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,520
I will take good care of my wife.

280
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,430
You are going to

281
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,410
If I were a step later

282
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,690
I don't know how things will turn out.

283
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,230
Go now

284
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,710
I'll be back soon

285
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,540

We have to find a way

289
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,190
Why are you so useless?

290
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,150
Please show us one

291
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,490
The majesty that a master should have

292
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,770
I'm so scared of the Queen Mother

293
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,620
Hold your position

294
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,580
Come down

295
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,240
The King and the Concubine

296
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,330
Greetings

Niangniang

298
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,310
His Majesty has arrived

299
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,820
nave

300
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,780
She is unconscious.

301
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,860
how's it going

302
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,000
Signs of a miscarriage

303
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,170

Signs of a miscarriage

Signs of a miscarriage

305
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,430
Because the bleeding doesn't stop

306
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,090
(Symptoms of continuous bleeding and uterine bleeding)
Because the bleeding doesn't stop

307
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:30,510
(Symptoms of continuous bleeding and uterine bleeding)

308
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,850
If this continues
(Symptoms of continuous bleeding and uterine bleeding)

309
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,900
The empress and the fetus in her belly

310
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,360
It will be dangerous

311
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,430
But why did you withdraw the needle?

312
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,960
Now

313
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,470
It is a state where even acupuncture treatment is unacceptable

314
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,270
We can only wait for the two of them to get through this difficult time.

315
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,200
Tonight

316
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,700
It's a critical moment

317
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,000
Niangniang

318

319
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,090
Your Highness

320
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,620
Although I'm sorry

321
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
Because you need to continue treatment

322
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,740
Please temporarily avoid

323
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,820
Your Highness

324
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,760
Please go out for a while.

325
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,820
Niangniang

326
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,820
Niangniang

327
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,170
What I can do

328
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,690
There is nothing

329
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,900
nave

330
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,050
Both

331
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,940
Safe and sound

332
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,540
Your Highness

333
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,880
Now, for my world,

334
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,890
All is well now.

335
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,400
Your Highness

336
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,610
it's all over

337
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,710
I didn't expect that the guy on the Lord

338
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,450
He is really a capable person.

339
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,670
Niangniang

340
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,430
How dare you yell?

341
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,780
That's because

342
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,450
The decree that the Queen Mother move to the West Palace

343
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,360
What

344
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,120
Do you mean you dared to send me to the West Palace?

345
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,210
What do you think of my family?

346
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,200
What are you doing? Open it now.

347
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,480
The door cannot be opened, Queen Dowager

348
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,500
Why don't you open this door right now?

349
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,810
The Queen Mother Arrives

350
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,790
Open it

351
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,830
I heard that he was very healthy after being in critical condition all night.

352
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,210
It's all thanks to the Queen Mother.

353
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,060
Where do you want to go?

354
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,670
Can I report this to you one by one?

355
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,340
It has been decided to move the Queen's residence to the West Palace

356
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,050
Until then, you can only live in Tongming Palace.

357
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,170
No going out

358
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,450
Does that mean the Central Palace dared to imprison me?

359
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,160
That's ridiculous.

360
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,160
Get out of the way

361
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,290
Can't

362
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,990
Get out of the way immediately

363
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,980
The King and the Concubine

364
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,980
Even if I die

365
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,230
Please die here too.

366
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,350
What is the Queen doing?

367
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,560
It's the queen

368
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,800
How dare you

369
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,150
The era of the empress is over

370
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,050
Now the master of the inner lady

371
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
It's a concubine

372
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,140
Aijia is the master

373
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,550
Aijia persists until now

374
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,430
It's Ai's.

375
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,480
Everything will change in the future

376
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,210
Especially the one the Queen Dowager wants to make

377
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,100
Rules and Etiquette

378
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,670
This is accumulated over hundreds and thousands of years.

379
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,330
Do you think it will collapse in an instant?

380
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,420
It's already collapsing

381
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,970
Such a scary change

382
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,710
It has already started

383
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,830
Damn, super refreshing

384
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,630
Oh my god

385
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,390
Choi Sang-Gong

386
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,750
What did I just say?

387
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,330
Damn, super refreshing

388
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,690
You said so

389
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,950
Maybe my inner nature has been awakened?

390
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,540
The refreshing feeling in my heart

391
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,280
It can't end, damn it.

392
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,760
Neuropathy

393
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,490
Good mood

394
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,580
hateful

395
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,590
Dog-like

396
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,300
hateful

397
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,410
What's up

398
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,840
Sinner Zhao

399
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,230
Spreading rumors to frame the High Temple

400
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,230
Makes people doubt the bloodline of the prince

401
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,050
Tarnished the reputation of the royal family

402
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,080
The crime of throwing the country into chaos

403
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,140
Ordered to be exiled to the West Palace

404
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,080
Another false accusation

405
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,410
I definitely didn't do it.

406
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,280
Is that true?

407
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,080
I swear on the honor of my late king.

408
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,520
I definitely didn't do it.

409
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,570
Come in

410
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,020
The sinner below

411
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,170
Confiscating property and fighting a hundred battles

412
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,880
Imprisoned in Jeju Prison

413
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,710
His wife and children are not held responsible

414
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,680
Former Prime Minister Kim Byung-hak

415
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,790
Former Right State Councillor Cho Man-hong

416
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,800
Former Left State Councillor Kim Seok-geun

417
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,710
Former Military Minister Kim Chang-hyup

418
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,910
Kim Soo-hoon

419
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,990
Zhao Dewen, former Minister of Personnel

420
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,650
In addition, the criminals recorded in the text

421
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,080
Exemption from the death penalty and confiscation of property

422
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,880
Three years in prison

423
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,270
Wrongly accused His Highness Wrongly accused His Highness

424
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,210
We are just threatened by the traitor Kim Byung-in.

425
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,530
I absolutely do not have

426
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,750
Thoughts of rebellion

427
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,000
Please look carefully at your highness.

428
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,600
That's right, Your Highness.

429
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,700
We're just stupid

430
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,640
Took the lie that His Highness was killed by the Eastern Bandits seriously

431
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,480
Yeah

432
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,510
Then let me tell you about your other sins.

433
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,250
People who are now full in North Korea

434
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,170
The most sinful person

435
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,500
Is there anyone hungry here?

436
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,690
You use the blood and tears of the people

437
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,620
Fill your stomach

438
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,840
Forgot to govern the country

439
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,560
We should guide the people to take care of the people

440
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,760
Just trample the people underfoot

441
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,260
Pushed them in

442
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,080
A rocky mountain where even a hoe can't get in

443
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,110
And in return, they collected more taxes.

444
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,300
You are in a warm room

445
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,940
When I leaned back and rubbed my swollen belly

446
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,870
The people were lying on the cold ground

447
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,800
Can't sleep because of worrying about tomorrow's meal

448
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,900
How can I not be hungry?

449
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,330
How can I get taller?

450
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,930
How can I become bigger?

451
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,020
When you are comfortable

452
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,580
Even breathing is painful for the people

453
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,760
Don't think about the future.

454
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,380
Even now it feels like living in hell

455
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,600
That

456
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,140
Cherish your life and despise the lives of the people

457
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,580
The first sin

458
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,340
Let them live in hell every day

459
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,890
The second sin is not being able to think about the future

460
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,550
Let the father who cannot protect the family and

461
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,340
The father feels desperate because he cannot protect his country

462
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,440
The third crime

463
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,360
If there are people who have nothing to do with these crimes

464
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,120
Come to the front

465
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,570
Keep these sins in your bones

466
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,750
Repent

467
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,830
You are just shameless robbers.

468
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,280
That prince

469
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,100
He deserves to die. He is the worst.

470
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,630
He's the worst and most damnable.

471
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,930
He is the one who deserves to die.

472
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,600
He is the public enemy

473
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,560
Put that down and go.

474
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,400
Used every day

475
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,240
Although I can't go out and see people in the palace

476
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,580
That too

477
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,970
I always keep Jeon Sang-Gong by my side

478
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,270
Because you're honest.

479
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,450
You can't become a great man with different intentions

480
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,670
Too

481
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,590
People live in different ways

482
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,380
Madam, you are not angry as usual.

483
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,740
The Queen didn't know how to read the eyes until the end

484
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,610
I endured it all

485
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,980
What is the purpose of the crying Queen?

486
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,980
Niangniang

487
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,560
I will definitely live

488
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,710
Being alive is winning

489
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,560
Hold my hand

490
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,360
Until you escape safely

491
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,300
What trick do you have?

492
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,320
If there is memory

493
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,040
There is still Zhao Rong in your body

494
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,800
My brother found me again.

495
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,790
I will hide myself tightly

496
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,650
Really

497
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,550
real

498
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,840
hurry up

499
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,330
Sorry, Madam.

500
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,560
Your laughter is beautiful.

501
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,800
Sorry, Madam.

502
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,450
A lot of girls have changed

503
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,210
Haven't been myself for a while, have I?

504
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,150
At once

505
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,360
It's too big to treat it as the middle hall.

506
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,940
It's different from before the marriage, my lady.

507
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,330
At that time, I thought I could decide

508
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,920
Only Death

509
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,090
(Bad Comes Jang Bong-hwan)

510
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,700
Did you get back safely?

511
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,050
Niangniang

512
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,200
Father

513
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,840
Can't

514
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,290
Don't come over here if you're in this condition.

515
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,610
I went

516
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,440
How are you? How are you?

517
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,360
Father, you speak first.

518
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,580
No, empress first

519
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,780
Very healthy very healthy

520
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,630
Nothing's wrong?

521
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,740
Of course, of course

522
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,620
Thank goodness you survived

523
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,220
The coronation ceremony was not because

524
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,710
Did the army that reached Hanyang tremble in fear?

525
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,830
At that time, the villagers came forward to protect our family.

526
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,090
Open warehouse

527
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,790
Help their virtuous families

528
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,740
I just

529
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,110
Just listen to what the queen says

530
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,100
I feel so ashamed.

531
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,760
Just show your virtue from now on.

532
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,960
Of course, of course

533
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,780
Even for our little baby

534
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,350
I also want to be a grandfather with a clear conscience.

535
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,040
Oh my god, fetal movement

536
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,550
The fetus moved so quickly.

537
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,230
Is my grandson a genius?

538
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,840
Onion flavor

539
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,780
What are you working on so seriously?

540
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,960
Before I imitated

541
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,740
The secret recipe of Sanxiang Ramen made by the Empress

542
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,310
So

543
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,490
Let me have some ramen before I leave.

544
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,740
Cooked in no time

545
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,010
I thought we were in a peaceful and prosperous era.

546
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,290
I can relax now.

547
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,410
How can it get busier?

548
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,610
No one

549
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,580
Hongbiejian

550
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,250
I am busy

551
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,320
You can complain later.

552
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,430
I've stopped complaining.

553
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,580
You?

554
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,130
Because I have made great contributions this time

555
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,350
His Highness wants to give me a high position

556
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,670
That is to say

557
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,290
I am still Hongbyeol

558
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,640
Did you ask His Highness for the position of Prime Minister?

559
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,470
What is that ugly object?

560
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,770
What should I do if I have no vision?

561
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,580
This time I

562
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,410
I applied to join the diplomatic mission at the Institute of Translation

563
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,060
For a talent like me

564
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,820
North Korea is really too small

565
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:37,430
congratulations

566
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,930
Stop complaining

567
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,430
Then it became the business of the diplomatic corps.

568
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,530
Things to run around for

569
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,050
What is there to congratulate?

570
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,650
But I still can't believe it

571
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,820
Li Shengli is the queen

572
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:51,920
You who I haven't discovered yet

573
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,760
It's unbelievable to me

574
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,570
Is Douyi not finished yet?

575
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,630
You are here too.

576
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,790
Long time no see Zongzhe

577
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,500
ah

578
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,430
If Li Shengrui is the queen

579
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,840
That Zongzhe you

580
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,150
She's a woman too.

581
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,980
As expected, Jin Huan, you have a good intuition.

582
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,860
I heard you got an official position this time.

583
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,370
Your Highness gave it to me.

584
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,370
Oh my god

585
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,990
April

586
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,340
You go back first

587
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,240
yes

588
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,970
How come you are here?

589
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,720
The weather is so cold. Have you been waiting for a long time?

590
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,510
No

591
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,930
I just

592
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,840
What's wrong with you?

593
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,360
I have some cramps.

594
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,440
Are you alright?

595
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,850
Um

596
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,510
Your Highness is doing well.

597
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,290
no

598
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,920
I'm asking you, Yongping-kun.

599
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,910
I

600
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,390
Now the Three Political Rectification Office

601
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,190
Also stabilized the position

602
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,560
Thanks to you, I have so much work to do.

603
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,980
So what to do next

604
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,340
I want to use my strength

605
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,070
Distribute to the people one by one

606
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,380
Become a force that can surpass the power of the few

607
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,960
Let those corrupt people

608
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,720
No longer able to dominate

609
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,970
I think that's the hard battle.

610
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:14,090
And the end of an amazing journey

611
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,850
It sounds like I'm going to be busier.

612
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,610
You'd better get off work quickly.

613
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,300
Really

614
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,800
Better leave quickly.

615
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,620
Anyway, I have to watch it again tomorrow morning.

616
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,960
It really doesn't match me.

617
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,640
Even so, you have to organize

618
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:33,610
Take a break

619
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,390
OK

620
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:35,940
Fighting One

621
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,960
You also sorted it out

622
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,820
Dou Yi is really

623
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,390
(Nave Dictionary)

624
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,600
Did I lose something?

625
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,020
This feeling hurts my heart

626
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,570
Success

627
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:30,670
He finally succeeded

628
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,630
(Veritable Records of the 25th King Cheoljong)
He finally succeeded

629
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,390
(Veritable Records of the 25th King Cheoljong)

630
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,110
(Chekjong Veritable Records)

631
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,920
nave

632
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,270
Isn't it funny?

633
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,900
(Cheoljong Goshin)

634
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:22,750
Zhang Fenghuan

635
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,900
hateful

636
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,290
Don't come over

637
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,680
We need to find Director Han first.

638
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:33,710
wrong

639
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,770
Is it the fastest to spread it to the public?

640
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,080
Why on earth are you running away?

641
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,610
Obviously did a good thing

642
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,820
Good things

643
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,500
But why surveillance?

644
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,620
Someone who did good things

645
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,040
Not surveillance

646
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,160
It is to provide personal protection for public interest whistleblowers

647
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,560
Public welfare?

648
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,620
Isn't there a surveillance camera in the food warehouse?

649
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,440
The one you secretly repaired

650
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:56,680
Me?

651
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,720
Wait a moment

652
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,910
Are you in charge of the surveillance video?

653
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,830
It's strange that there are always glitches.

654
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,790
To catch the thief

655
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,120
Why do useless things?

656
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,730
You are nothing like Jang Bong-hwan

657
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,630
Here we come

658
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,620
Why don't you come and tell me soon?

659
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,810
I've gotten into trouble

660
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:31,160
What

661
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,910
The surveillance video was given to the media free of charge

662
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,490
Very unlike my style

663
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,340
He must be lying.

664
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,000
Definitely

665
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,770
The Zhang Fenghuan I know

666
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,730
Not the justice type

667
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,210
Before giving it to the media

668
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,110
The guy who made the first deal with me

669
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:49,980
Isn't it?

670
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,270
Yeah, I'm that kind of guy.

671
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:56,700
but

672
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,250
I have changed

673
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,570
Really? Why?

674
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:02,630
have no idea

675
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,470
I just want to do that.

676
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,020
You stinky guy

677
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,090
Push him

678
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,150
Push him quickly

679
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,170
Really

680
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,730
Cheoljong successfully changed his destiny

681
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,390
I've changed too

682
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,210
But why is Director Han still the same?

683
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,850
(Cheoljong)

684
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,810
Hasn't the world changed?

685
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,670
Are Cheoljong and I the only ones who have changed?

686
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,010
(Zhezong's gentle courage shocked Joseon)

687
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,070
(Zhezong, who led the reforms by standing on the side of the people,
Queen Cheorin's non-status responsibility system)

688
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,020
(A role model for reforming monarchs, the achievements of King Cheoljong and Queen Cheorin)

689
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,060
(Cheoljong, laid the foundation for democracy in the Republic of Korea)

690
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:20,240
Please say something. Look here.

691
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:26,070
Please say something. Look here.

692
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,080
Even if history has changed

693
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,860
But the corrupt

694
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,130
No matter what method you use, you will survive

695
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,330
But in a beautiful world

696
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,850
Will not rot due to corruption

697
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,710
But a world where the rotten parts can be removed

698
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,520
Try to change your life

699
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,570
The world will change without you noticing

700
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,790
Just like me and Cheoljong

701
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:17,620
Your Highness

702
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,040
Um

703
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,840
Uh-huh

704
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,760
Your Highness

705
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,230
Can't concentrate?

706
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,700
The face of the nave always appears before me

707
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,990
It makes me unable to concentrate.

708
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,460
No more

709
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:40,970
I want to take a look at the rear of the palace

710
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,570
Come back and focus again

711
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,090
Next Steps

712
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:51,120
Allowing women over 18 years old to marry

713
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,030
Then

714
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,210
It is forbidden to take palace maids under the age of 10

715
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,370
Bring it to the inner lady

716
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,730
Then

717
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,040
What's next, sis?

718
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,130
Niangniang

719
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,530
Sorry Choi Sang-Gong

720
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,380
I couldn't concentrate from the beginning.

721
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,140
How long has it been since I last saw His Majesty?

722
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,100
Not me

723
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,510
It's our children

724
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,290
For prenatal education

725
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,290
How about going to see the Emperor?

726
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,550
That is to say

727
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:42,970
Your Highness

728
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,600
Um

729
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:46,860
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace went to Xuanzheng Hall

730
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,430
Oops, I took the wrong road.

731
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:54,970
Has Your Highness gone to build a grand palace?

732
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,020
Yes

733
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,650
Let's go together, my lady.

734
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,310
Are you so happy?

735
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:19,400
Oops, I took the wrong road again.

736
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,360
It's not hide and seek

737
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:32,740
No more

738
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,640
At this time

739
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,760
I finally see you

740
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:55,310
I really missed too much.

741
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,970
That short

742
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,480
It feels like a long time has passed.

743
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,010
but

744
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,270
Why do you always use honorifics with me recently?

745
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,350
Are you trying to scare me again?

746
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,460
(This drama is purely fictional. The characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

747
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,670
(Thanks to Choi Jin Hyuk for his special appearance)
