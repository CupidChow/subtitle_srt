2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,900
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,150
Who are you

4
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,040
What on earth did you do to Zhao Rong?

5
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,980
Oh

6
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,580
Let me go

7
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,670
If you don't want to die

8
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,930
Tell me the truth

9
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,340
I didn't do anything

10
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,180
But when I opened my eyes, I was already inside her

11
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,670
The real Zhao Rong

12
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,920
I don't know either

13
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,810
I don't know whether she is alive or dead.

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm going to kill you

15
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,420
Brother

16
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,520
When did it start not being Zhaorong's?

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,210
After waking up from falling into the lake

18
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,050
But you know what happened between me and Zhao Rong

19
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,340
Suddenly I knew

20
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,900
Her memory

21
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:50,996
It turns out to be here

22
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:10,566
stand up

23
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,306
Unless you want to die here

24
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,426
Until I get away safely

25
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,800
Hold my hand first

26
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,460
What are you doing?

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,860
As long as you still have her memory

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,300
Then Zhao Rong is still alive in your body

29
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,930
So you have to survive

30
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,450
Must survive

31
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,770
As expected

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,700
The woman you admire is really

33
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,650
Don't do this

34
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,150
I don't want to hurt you, back off.

35
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,870
So arrogant till the end

36
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,490
Chase me

37
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,760
The Military Minister disobeyed orders

38
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,020
Now obey my orders.

39
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes Yes

40
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,650
Get up, get up quickly

41
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,050
You're bleeding too much. You need to stop the bleeding first.

42
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,520
What's this

43
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,990
It is a letter of alliance with the names of those who planned the rebellion.

44
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,630
Use it to protect yourself.

45
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,440
Do you remember when you were a kid?

46
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,320
Play hide and seek with me?

47
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,940
I count to ten

48
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,660
Go hide now.

49
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,370
Let's go together

50
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,850
He's coming soon.

51
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,030
it's useless

52
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,940
Go fast

53
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,260
Don't look back

54
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,830
don't want

55
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't let Zhaorong die

56
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,720
quick

57
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,750
I said count to ten

58
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,240
one two three

59
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,310
Five or six

60
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,610
Who sent you?

61
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,460
Who else could it be?

62
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,520
Of course it's your dad.

63
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,440
ninety

64
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,350
They said don't look back.

65
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,750
Chasing Kim So-yong

66
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,390
Brother

67
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,410
Come here, we said we were leaving together.

68
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,640
I want to buy a hairpin for meeting His Majesty

69
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,460
Brother, help me choose one.

70
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,130
Yeah, don't be too fancy.

71
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,380
But a little more special

72
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,270
Look ahead and walk

73
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,740
I

74
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,940
I've been watching you

75
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,680
Even what you haven't seen

76
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,860
Your appearance

77
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,540
But why am I

78
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,050
I couldn't recognize it.

79
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,140
She definitely didn't run far.

80
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,060
Fast Chase

81
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,160
Where on earth did she go?

82
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,220
Search for me

83
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,440
Yes Yes

84
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,860
Over there

85
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,690
What do I do with this alone?

86
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,390
I don't even know where I am now

87
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,800
What can I do?

88
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,330
Even if they die in front of me

89
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,960
I couldn't do anything for them.

90
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,860
Anything

91
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,400
Game Over

92
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,740
Even if I struggle

93
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,190
The impossible is still impossible

94
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,680
Yeah, take me back.

95
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,880
It's over anyway.

96
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,200
(Episode 19: The Man Who Returned from Hell)

97
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,250
nave

98
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,330
You're still alive

99
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,460
Fortunately, fortunately.

100
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
alright

101
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,630
I'm glad you're still alive,

102
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,960
That's good.

103
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,340
Choi Sang-Gong and Hong Yeon are all dead

104
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,550
Jin Bingren and the others are dead

105
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,140
How did Kim Byung-in die?

106
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,060
He died because of me.

107
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,050
They're all dead because of me.

108
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,000
Calm down, Nave

109
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,550
Be Cool

110
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,500
Hongyan and Choi Sang-Gong are both safe and sound.

111
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,210
Niangniang

112
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,140
Hong Yan

113
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,310
Madam, are you okay?

114
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm fine. Choi Sang-Gong

115
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,210
Niangniang

116
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,760
Choi Sang-Gong

117
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,580
What should I do, my Choi Sang-Gong?

118
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,510
Niangniang

119
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,450
It's really dangerous outside the palace

120
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,730
It hurts, right?

121
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,770
It hurts so much

122
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,110
what to do

123
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,400
Oops

124
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,700
So don't worry

125
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,900
This means I won't die.

126
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,590
If I die, I won't feel any pain.

127
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,940
But you were clearly stabbed.

128
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,590
I guess I'm lucky.

129
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,410
Get out of the way

130
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,970
His shoddy craftsmanship

131
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,590
It also helped me

132
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,910
I thought you were all killed.

133
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,060
Niangniang

134
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,730
Niangniang

135
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,640
MILF

136
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,130
Sorry, sorry.

137
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,500
What? Are you okay?

138
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,790
Sorry, sorry.

139
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,670
But where are you, my lady?

140
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,480
I just went out to look for you.

141
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,040
I searched everywhere but couldn't find you

142
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
Many people are out looking for you.

143
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,630
It was Your Highness who finally found you.

144
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,510
Niangniang

145
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,770
Miss you so much

146
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,230
I'm so lucky you're safe.

147
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,420
yes

148
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,190
Oops

149
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,230
Gotta wipe it.

150
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,350
It's not like a person would come here.

151
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,070
Because you never come home

152
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,350
So I'm here to pick you up.

153
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,240
You always scare me,

154
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,080
Can't miss

155
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,860
You are not in the palace

156
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,780
It's like a power outage

157
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,230
There's darkness all around me

158
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,860
That's right

159
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,810
What does a power outage mean?

160
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,270
I know it without explanation.

161
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,840
Your thoughts

162
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm the same as you

163
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,290
I miss you so much

164
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,970
My heart hurts more than my injured body

165
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,750
I will never leave the nave alone again

166
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,360
sorry

167
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,060
Is the injury serious?

168
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,280
fine

169
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,200
As long as there is medicine, there is no problem

170
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,420
You know what attacked him?

171
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,570
What are those people's true identities?

172
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
Saw a familiar face

173
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,440
It's the Eastern Bandits

174
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,140
I have seen the Lord

175
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:58,350
(The king is not dead)

176
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,810
Wait a moment

177
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,350
They have all given special orders.

178
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,580
How can a woman run around?

179
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,950
I am the abandoned concubine Zhao

180
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,550
Because I can't show my face

181
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,720
I want to go out and relax when there are few people.

182
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,390
It's not safe recently. Please go back soon.

183
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,660
knew

184
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,170
Thank you for your hard work.

185
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:35,900
The Kim family is obsessed with money

186
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,500
(The king is not dead)
The Kim family is obsessed with money

187
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,520
(The king is not dead)

188
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,420
Want to kill the king
(The king is not dead)

189
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,440
(The king is not dead)

190
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,520
Accusing innocent people of crimes
(The king is not dead)

191
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,670
Accusing innocent people of crimes

192
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,340
Because the King of Destiny is still alive

193
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,660
Give a throne that is not yet vacant

194
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,540
What's the point of forcing people to sit on it?

195
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,140
Your Excellency

196
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,540
grown ups

197
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,330
This is everywhere.

198
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,970
What on earth is so shocking?

199
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,760
Hey hey hey

200
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Oops

201
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,790
Oops

202
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,580
Why

203
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,790
(The king is not dead)

204
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,970
If this is the case, our queen

205
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,050
Not to rest.

206
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,020
really

207
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,890
Kim Byung-in still can't escape

208
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,420
The palm of Jin Zuogen's hand

209
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,080
He could see that Kim Byung-in would betray him.

210
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,420
The adults ordered

211
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,130
Don't announce Kim Byung-in's death yet

212
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,720
It's the father

213
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
anyway

214
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,020
You are really standing

215
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,690
On the side of Mr. Kim Jageun

216
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,610
Failed to catch the central temple

217
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,800
Can make up for the past

218
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,380
To make up for the previous mistakes

219
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,460
Oops

220
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,500
It will be cooked if it is cooked for such a long time.

221
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,960
Never mind

222
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,930
Since the Queen Mother went to recuperate

223
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,690
He has always been so absent-minded

224
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,270
They all say happy enemies

225
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,610
In such a short time

226
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,330
He has developed feelings for the Queen Mother.

227
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,510
Why

228
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,250
His Highness actually left like this

229
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,200
Why

230
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,240
He truly loves his people.

231
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,140
Why

232
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,190
really

233
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,080
You're the only one left

234
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,110
Oops

235
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,530
Oops

236
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,740
This me

237
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,950
Even when I go home, no one is waiting for me

238
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,070
The Queen Mother

239
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,270
It's sad too.

240
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,240
I don't know how to comfort Choi Sang-Gong

241
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
Waiting for experienced people

242
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,970
It has comforted me.

243
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,170
It can make me forget about nagging for a while.

244
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,620
Alas, I am also blessed by Choi Sang-Gong

245
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,640
Do you want to have a drink with me?

246
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,860
No

247
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,190
Because I have something to do

248
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,050
Wait a minute

249
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,340
I'm going to get you something to eat.

250
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,890
I like you

251
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,000
I adore you

252
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,340
I am a person who cannot express my feelings

253
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,250
so

254
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,590
So I hope you will be familiar with it.

255
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,290
To meet someone who can share your loneliness

256
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,530
Choi Sang-Gong

257
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,040
I always feel weird

258
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,900
How is the imperial meal preparation going?

259
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,400
Hey, hey, you, you

260
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,560
Waiting for experienced people

261
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,850
Oh, it's all broken.

262
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,920
The experienced cook actually ruined the dish

263
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,330
What's going on?

264
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,730
It's not me that's in trouble, it's the country

265
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,080
I don't know how chaotic those areas are.

266
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,970
There has been no delivery in the past few days.

267
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,100
Waiting for experienced people

268
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,360
Now there are strange notices posted on the streets

269
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,020
The one who killed His Highness was

270
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,830
Oh, if it weren't for the Eastern Bandits

271
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,410
Who would do such a thing?

272
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,290
Damn these guys should be exterminated.

273
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,990
Hello

274
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,180
How do you know how to cut off your family lineage?

275
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,120
You shut up

276
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,720
you say

277
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,630
I've been wearing this for so long that I'm tired of it.

278
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,080
Now is the time to take it off, right?

279
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,880
Can you do it?

280
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,670
You have been studying under me for ten years.

281
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,080
What

282
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,610
Oops

283
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,810
Where are you going

284
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,720
Who will prepare the imperial meal?

285
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,020
There are many people in North Korea who can serve as skilled waiters.

286
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,250
that

287
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,480
Started two days ago

288
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,690
Strange notices were posted on the streets

289
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,220
It's a rumor about the Lord.

290
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,240
Oops

291
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
Is now the time to worry about rumors?

292
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,260
It will end once the enthronement ceremony is over.

293
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,040
Now we have to worry about

294
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,760
The fellow disciple who holds our lifeline

295
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,930
Too

296
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,780
recent

297
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,250
It was strange not to see Kim Byung-in.

298
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,090
It is said that the nave left to prepare for the birth.

299
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,150
Kim Byung-in also disappeared

300
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,410
The Lord's Death

301
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,270
There is also a healing place in the nave

302
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,700
Something feels wrong

303
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,400
just in case

304
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,790
Both are false.

305
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,220
The nave that discovered the fake death

306
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,320
Hidden somewhere far away

307
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,190
Is Kim Byeong-in on the side of the Jungjeon?

308
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,390
In this case, Kim Byung-in

309
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,390
To fight against Jin

310
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,700
Will use the same door

311
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,830
Very cold

312
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,080
It's cold.

313
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,490
It's really shameful

314
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,900
Wait a moment

315
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
As soon as you leave

316
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,680
The weather suddenly turned cold

317
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,750
Isn't it because

318
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,750
Do you feel cold when I'm not around?

319
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,570
Love overflowing from the nave

320
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,990
Thank you

321
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,890
1232

322
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,960
1233

323
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,870
1234

324
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,310
that

325
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,910
This is the training method that the middle palace told me

326
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,540
That's why I made a military book.

327
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,360
I didn't expect that His Majesty is really an Eastern Bandit.

328
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,860
Even they themselves don't know

329
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,360
I would think that just

330
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,300
Helping the tycoons who are dissatisfied with the country

331
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,160
Why do such a dangerous thing?

332
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,320
You said it was either the enemy or the friendly forces, right?

333
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,220
Corrupt people

334
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,540
Our common enemy

335
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,680
But the scale is too simple.

336
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,850
Where is everyone?

337
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,770
Gather together and wait to be eliminated?

338
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,430
When the uprising started

339
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,980
Everyone will gather together

340
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,750
Scattered distribution is safe

341
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,320
Are you the boss here?

342
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,250
That's right

343
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,340
Nice to meet you

344
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,130
From the looks of it, he really looks like the leader

345
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,860
Especially the wound next to the eye looks very brave

346
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,270
Nice to meet you

347
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,630
Here just

348
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,470
The guy with the longest life span is the leader

349
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,520
If the leader dies

350
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,130
The next person will be the leader

351
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,380
The so-called leader

352
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,500
It means living here the longest.

353
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,520
If I die

354
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,560
There

355
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,160
That guy is the leader.

356
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,500
123 10

357
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,010
So young children?

358
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,670
I heard about the fate between us Tan Yang and you

359
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,630
Are we Tan Yang?

360
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,820
Shouldn't

361
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,160
This is what we were looking for

362
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,060
Tan Yang's father

363
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,580
that

364
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,380
Are there hardships in your eyes?

365
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,790
It’s a Small World

366
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,970
If it weren't for us Tan Yang

367
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,860
This person died in my hands a long time ago.

368
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,570
The master who caused the country to become like this

369
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,820
If I see him, I will take his head

370
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,900
Thank you, my daughter.

371
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,210
I was going to kill me

372
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,510
You almost died.

373
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,650
What

374
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,680
I saved you in vain.

375
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,270
I should have chopped off your wrist with a guillotine.

376
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,870
123 10

377
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,640
How long do I have to keep doing this?

378
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,210
I know, I will do the next stage.

379
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,690
From one to ten, that's true

380
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,890
Tan Yang not only saved you, the middle palace

381
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,530
Also saved the widow

382
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,950
Because the king did not abandon his people

383
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,600
The people saved the king

384
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,500
but

385
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,400
Where are the soldiers chasing me?

386
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,880
Most of them

387
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,760
A hunter and herbalist who grew up in this mountain.

388
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,600
I know the terrain here very well.

389
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,680
Here

390
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,730
The soldiers could only be repelled

391
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,980
Where's that weird guy in the goblin mask?

392
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,150
Did you catch it?

393
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,460
Ghost Mask

394
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,400
Did that person chase you?

395
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,980
That guy was going to kill me.

396
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,010
To prevent that

397
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,590
Kim Byung-in died

398
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,210
The man in the mask

399
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,870
He is Jin Zuogen's subordinate

400
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,380
It turns out that Jin Zuogen is back

401
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,110
1238

402
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,180
1239

403
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,050
(One day before the enthronement ceremony)
1239

404
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,120
123 10
(One day before the enthronement ceremony)

405
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,210
123 10

406
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,760
This is Death Note

407
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,320
It means that you can punish

408
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,750
Blacklist of corrupt ministers

409
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,740
Just find a way to get into the palace.

410
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,720
If we gather the civilian food army from all over the country

411
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,740
How many people

412
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,120
If people from all over the country gather together

413
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,030
perhaps

414
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,420
one thousand people

415
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,190
Is that all?

416
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,850
What do you mean?

417
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,030
Do you think it's easy to risk your life?

418
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,570
But why do you always release the leader?

419
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,300
Of course, if you want to win the battle, you have to execute the leader.

420
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,980
Do you think we are some kind of hungry wolves?

421
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,730
At least for the untouchables like us

422
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,880
If we gather together

423
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,770
Can make people in high positions tremble

424
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,690
Just need this

425
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,130
It's for publicity effect.

426
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,060
This is a good strategy

427
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,770
Nor did it give them an excuse to launch a massive attack.

428
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,660
No matter how ignorant

429
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,930
I also know that this is a direct response.

430
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,130
A losing fight

431
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,680
Just the newly selected soldiers

432
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,670
There are also a thousand

433
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,330
Even if he sacrificed his life to save the country

434
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,540
I can't recognize the great men who came to me.

435
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,000
Are you waiting for an experienced person?

436
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,940
You people

437
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,700
Waiting for experienced people

438
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,260
How can I believe what the people in the palace say?

439
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
Forget it.

440
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,730
Can't I just go back?

441
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,990
Come untie me

442
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,820
Got it Got it

443
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,840
I untie myself

444
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,940
Why are your eyes like this?

445
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,470
A guy much younger than me actually speaks half a language

446
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,310
I won't stay even if you ask me to.

447
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,810
Get out of the way

448
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,760
Even if you can come in at will

449
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,670
You can't go out at will.

450
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,250
This situation feels strangely familiar.

451
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,960
Saw what we all looked like

452
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,740
We also know where we gather

453
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,720
Can you get out alive?

454
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,940
hateful

455
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,840
Damn you guys

456
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,200
Waiting for experienced people

457
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,350
It seems that it is time to die.

458
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,140
There were also auditory hallucinations

459
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,110
Hey Wanfu

460
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,270
Niangniang

461
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,050
How come you are here?

462
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,280
Your Highness

463
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,360
Waiting for experienced people

464
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,200
Choi Sang-Gong

465
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,240
Choi Sang-Gong

466
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,280
Choi Sang-Gong Choi Sang-Gong

467
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,480
Waiting for experienced people

468
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,600
What's going on

469
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,450
Who did this?

470
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,410
What's going on

471
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,060
The experienced person is worthy of being Choi Sang-Gong

472
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,180
What's the matter with the experienced person coming here?

473
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,910
It's the queen

474
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,740
I heard that people who are dissatisfied with the country

475
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,410
All gathered here

476
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,860
Breathlessly searching

477
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,130
People who disappeared in the palace

478
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,460
It's all here.

479
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,930
Waiting for experienced people

480
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,150
Are you dissatisfied with the country?

481
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,490
Looking at the palace

482
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,510
There is no dissatisfaction.

483
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,720
What is the situation in the palace now?

484
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,530
yes

485
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,540
Your Highness

486
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,570
Let's get dressed first.

487
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,380
Block your cough

488
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,380
Please

489
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,800
In preparation for tomorrow's coronation ceremony

490
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,230
One day is not enough

491
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,970
Thank you for your hard work

492
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,750
but

493
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,030
Why are the Eastern bandits becoming more rampant?

494
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,410
I heard it's not unusual

495
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,300
The more united the opponents are in the so-called struggle

496
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,180
The more you think you are justified

497
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,490
And gradually became more angry

498
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,200
therefore

499
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,010
The only way is to pedal harder.

500
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,660
As soon as the coronation ceremony is over, we will suppress it immediately.

501
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,790
Why did you mention the sword?

502
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,450
Is it that even the palace has become dangerous?

503
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,910
This is the sword given by the Queen Mother.

504
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,820
Nave?

505
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,240
actually

506
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,440
I'm sorry to tell you early in the morning.

507
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,840
To protect the Queen, Byeong-in

508
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,570
Gave up his life

509
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,110
final

510
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,250
Because of temporary feelings

511
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,370
I gave away all my stupidity

512
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,840
The only drawback is youth

513
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,310
so

514
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,090
Did the Nave survive?

515
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,100
Yes

516
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,640
The one who saved the central hall was the Lord

517
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,110
The Lord survived.

518
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,420
Did the middle temple survive?

519
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,950
There is no capable person

520
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,590
Those two are amazing people.

521
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,100
I am terrified

522
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,870
So tomorrow's coronation

523
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,130
Before

524
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,970
When I wanted to make the Namjordans eat ice cubes containing arsenic

525
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,780
The master knew about it in advance and came here, right?

526
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,670
Anyway

527
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,400
It seems like there is a coward eavesdropping on our conversation

528
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,990
Isn't this the doctor my brother gave me?

529
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,480
He made her blind and deaf.

530
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,220
Because it's important

531
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,960
I'm too sensitive.

532
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,930
I know what you mean.

533
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,250
Bring the coronation ceremony forward as much as possible

534
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,110
Don't forget

535
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,820
My brother has already lost to those two people.

536
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,360
I'm risking my life in this battle.

537
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,110
I have a good idea

538
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,440
Not only the Hanyang City Gate

539
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,940
Even the palace gate can be passed through at once

540
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,030
What is the novel approach?

541
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,580
Keep eating

542
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,030
The one who uses the food made from my sacred ingredients

543
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,390
How many days can you survive without eating?

544
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,540
The Queen Mother is a picky person.

545
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,440
Absolutely unbearable

546
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,950
Don't want that

547
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,550
That that

548
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,440
So even if all the palace gates are closed

549
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,150
There is only one door that cannot be closed

550
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,520
It is the middle gate for delivering food.

551
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,800
I need information about the tribute car.

552
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,830
This palace is also known as the damn palace business

553
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,050
There are more than 50 cars every day.

554
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,400
Enter the Imperial Kitchen

555
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,630
Not only these

556
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,660
Every month, the bamboo silk palace merchants

557
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,780
There are also four silks every four months

558
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,360
Keep it simple and just say the key points

559
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,820
that

560
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,460
The car that entered on the morning of the enthronement ceremony

561
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,160
Sixty-two in total

562
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,660
But now that an emergency order has been issued

563
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,750
The tribute will be checked more carefully than before.

564
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,720
But what if there is a car that no one knows about?

565
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,890
The Secret Cart of Duxelles

566
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,680
Here it comes

567
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,300
It's our stuff, let him in.

568
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,810
Come in quickly

569
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,120
Listen to the chef leader

570
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,960
Du Xueli is substituting one thing for another

571
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,490
Substituting one thing for another

572
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,210
People in high positions

573
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,910
Not my absolute taste

574
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,610
Part of the tribute

575
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,500
Switch to a slightly lower level

576
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,140
Car with replacement parts

577
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,360
It is the secret car of Duxelles.

578
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,230
Few people know this.

579
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,240
really

580
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,900
I said it's not a palace but a bandit's lair

581
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,020
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

582
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,780
I think it's a habit so

583
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,440
How can a rotten tree have no holes?

584
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,180
Let's use that hole.

585
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,380
Come on, bring your hands up

586
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,800
All of them? Yes, take them.

587
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,550
hand

588
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,440
Put it together Put it together

589
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,080
One, two, three, come on!

590
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,700
come on

591
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,850
come on

592
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,210
Are you ready?

593
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,790
Well, let's go.

594
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,390
Wanfu

595
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,760
It's your highness

596
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,970
Come soon

597
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,650
I also changed clothes.

598
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,540
Let's go

599
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,250
Thanks

600
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,320
And I'm sorry

601
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,210
You are special to Kim So Yong

602
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,700
I want to bury him myself

603
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,130
OK

604
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,990
Rest in peace

605
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,930
let's go

606
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,860
Speak

607
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,280
There should be a mother

608
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,090
Help our princess prepare for childbirth

609
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,720
My situation now is this

610
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,780
I want to help her myself

611
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,380
I heard he was recuperating

612
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,830
So I want to go see her.

613
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,910
For the safety of the princess who is pregnant with the king's grandson

614
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,270
Hiding the location

615
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,530
I won't let her lack anything.

616
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,920
Don't worry

617
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,150
that

618
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,680
(The king is not dead)

619
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,430
Did you really go to recuperate?
(The king is not dead)

620
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,520
Did you really go to recuperate?

621
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,770
Did he kill the empress?

622
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,120
The princess ran away from home

623
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,410
We are protecting her reputation.

624
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,590
Running away from home?

625
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,370
Probably because she was holding the king alive.

626
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,100
False dream out of the palace

627
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,200
Although terrified

628
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,250
But I'm sorry to tell the Queen Mother

629
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,360
This is not really good for the family.

630
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,570
Instead, it tarnishes the reputation of our family.

631
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,790
Don’t you know what will happen to our descendants?

632
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,540
Is Guo Zhang qualified to say such things?

633
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,160
At least I don't feel ashamed now.

634
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,680
It is because of shame that it becomes a sin

635
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,100
No shame, no sin

636
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,960
If it weren't for the family

637
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,210
Killing His Highness

638
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,110
What do you want?

639
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,220
Before I let go

640
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,140
My era can't end

641
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,350
You can hear

642
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:14,740
here

643
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,560
Oh my god

644
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,060
Your Highness

645
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,100
You have arrived

646
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,070
Yes Yes

647
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,050
Both legs are broken.

648
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,630
MILF

649
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,060
Um

650
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,370
It's hard to see you alive.

651
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,570
Fortunately, His Highness is fine.

652
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,260
Is there no one here?

653
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,780
The ground is cold

654
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,010
Have a cold beer now

655
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
It will definitely be full of energy

656
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,770
but

657
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,920
It's not a great place.

658
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,520
How did you get here?

659
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,600
This is a safe place without exposure

660
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,620
Well, I can't even expose myself if I want to.

661
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,260
My legs

662
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,400
hateful

663
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,480
Not yet

664
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,090
That's it.

665
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,960
This is your last chance, be careful.

666
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,590
The time is now

667
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,860
Is it so delicious?

668
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:56,990
that

669
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,150
this

670
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,680
good

671
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,990
Oh my god.

672
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,880
No

673
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,890
So delicious

674
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,380
Why do you want to suffer?

675
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,320
People like me

676
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,670
Anyway, it's a dead end in the end.

677
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,050
It can be said that there is no alternative

678
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,040
They are the highest-ranking people in North Korea.

679
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,320
As long as one eye is open and one eye is closed

680
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,110
Wouldn't it make you feel comfortable?

681
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,580
for me

682
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,940
Life used to be just a hell to endure

683
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,710
The man who killed my parents and brothers

684
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,900
I survived with the determination to take revenge myself.

685
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,830
That's how I saw North Korea dying.

686
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,290
Then I saw the people groaning among them

687
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,280
He is a king with very good eyesight.

688
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,880
I thought everyone in the palace was blind

689
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,890
If this succeeds

690
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,070
You won't become like them.

691
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,110
I am now

692
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,370
Dreaming of a new North Korea

693
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,030
That's called voting, right?

694
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,730
What

695
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,370
The people themselves choose their king

696
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,040
Yeah, it's called voting.

697
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,580
Although it will not make the world

698
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Things that become perfect

699
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,240
no

700
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,450
That alone is perfect.

701
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,810
Maybe it can be changed at any time.

702
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,390
This one

703
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,220
It can be said that they are a pair of crazy nave and king.

704
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,090
Well, since there is still something important to do

705
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,910
Let's go to bed early.

706
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:39,850
Good night

707
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,290
If you really came from the future,

708
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,100
Then you know how this battle ends.

709
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,300
What will it become?

710
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,600
You will lose

711
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,810
But I'll bet everything on you

712
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,860
Your group shouldn't be

713
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,340
Will it be the winning side?

714
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:11,820
It doesn't matter

715
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,070
My life is already ruined anyway.

716
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,990
Even if I risk everything

717
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,980
Nothing

718
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,130
It seems that you put all the eggs in the temple

719
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,520
I have them all here.

720
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,640
Yes, that's right

721
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,170
Well, I'm all in on you.

722
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:29,490
In this case

723
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,470
Even if I fail

724
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,880
I will also try my best

725
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,130
It will make the guy who is destined to be there feel exhausted.

726
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,640
I won't be swallowed up obediently.

727
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,660
The body is trapped here

728
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,630
I can't help Your Highness at all.

729
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,180
Has the Queen seen His Highness?

730
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,460
Even if I saw

731
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,050
What can the two of them do?

732
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,200
We are here

733
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,780
How to stop the coronation ceremony

734
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,630
How to use Jin Huan

735
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,540
Hongbiejian

736
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,810
You are here again

737
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,960
I brought some stuff

738
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,930
This is

739
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,660
To get you two out.

740
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,230
I am gathering to submit petitions

741
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,370
But besides this

742
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,330
Is there anything I can definitely help you with?

743
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,110
Anything that can help us?

744
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,720
Well, just say it.

745
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,360
Even though?

746
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,490
Um

747
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,210
Is there anything I can't do for you?

748
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,580
one person

749
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,570
How can you be so unguarded and unsuspecting?

750
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,780
Is it your job to feed the liars?

751
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,010
How can you be so unmotivated?

752
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,060
I was wrong.

753
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,670
What's wrong?

754
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,260
Although I don't know what it is

755
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,340
As long as you tell me

756
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,600
I will never do it again.

757
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,020
What you did wrong is

758
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,670
Believe in me

759
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,410
I'm here to collect information

760
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,230
I'm fake close to you.

761
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,630
But you don't even know this

762
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,720
What are these?

763
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,780
you mean

764
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:05,270
Have you never considered me as a friend?

765
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,270
That's right

766
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,680
I am a moment

767
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,860
I don't consider you a friend.

768
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,760
So don't come to me again.

769
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

770
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,320
Are you blaming me for not using him again?

771
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,450
I'm not watching

772
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,120
But in front of my eyes

773
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,400
This unspeakable thing is happening.

774
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,000
You seem very tired.

775
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,040
No dehydration

776
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,360
But I took off the soju

777
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,900
Golden Ratio Beer

778
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,510
It seems you are dreaming

779
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,860
What a blessing!

780
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,300
What on earth did you dream about?

781
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,020
It's really burning with fire.

782
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,650
The fire engulfed the temple.

783
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,370
I'm stuck here alone

784
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,300
By that fire

785
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,050
Today is a very important day

786
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,580
So every drop is a pity

787
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,900
Dress me perfectly

788
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:27,920
(On the day of the enthronement ceremony)

789
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,530
For your safety

790
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,420
Today I also issued a no-entry order in the palace

791
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,890
Except the soldiers

792
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,100
No one can enter or leave the palace.

793
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,390
OK

794
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,130
Not to mention Yue Xuan

795
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,970
Not even the clan members called

796
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,050
Let's end the ceremony quietly.

797
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,260
Didn't even call the clan members?

798
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,800
This is safe

799
01:00:59,050 --> 01:00:59,740
but

800
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,450
What I said is correct

801
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,140
I see

802
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,780
Niangniang

803
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,540
Aren't you afraid?

804
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,680
Occasionally I meet someone who understands the Tao on the road

805
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,070
Catch me and tell me

806
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,320
My ancestors have done me a lot of good deeds.

807
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,340
Then I'll enjoy that favor this time.

808
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,270
Niangniang

809
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,370
Today you are more than ever

810
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,420
They are all like a nave queen

811
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,120
Stop creating atmosphere.

812
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,370
It feels like today is the last day

813
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,790
It's just started

814
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,900
That's right, ma'am.

815
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,870
See you tonight at the palace

816
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,570
Well, I'm leaving.

817
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,650
Don't die

818
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,420
What's good about living?

819
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,160
Even if it's unfortunate

820
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,330
Live long and long

821
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:22,740
If this succeeds,

822
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,270
The voting or something?

823
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,630
I will choose you as king

824
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,640
Thanks

825
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:34,960
Let's go

826
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,590
Now it's time to go home

827
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,700
Sinner Li Jingying

828
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,380
Because he concealed his intention to rebel

829
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,730
The crime of the identity of the Eastern bandits

830
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,760
Deprivation of office and exile

831
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,770
Sinner Hong Doo-il

832
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,630
Crime of losing a firearm

833
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,020
To be exiled to Jianghua Qifang Village

834
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,610
600 days of hard labor

835
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:58,550
After the coronation ceremony

836
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,620
Will execute immediately

837
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,150
At that time, because the king

838
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,220
There is nothing to record in history

839
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,510
It's really hard work.

840
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,790
The state affair is not over yet

841
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,200
Just smile with your teeth showing

842
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,650
Is it right?

843
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:24,920
I am terrified

844
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,950
Can today's ceremony be completed smoothly?

845
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,260
It's all in your hands

846
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,320
Um

847
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,890
I won't let you feel

848
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,670
The empty seat of the military judge

849
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,100
I will take responsibility and do it

850
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,660
That but

851
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,760
Kim Byeong-in, Minister of Military Affairs

852
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,170
When do you plan to enter the palace?

853
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,260
It seems that you are curious about Tongwen's whereabouts.

854
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,150
Everyone cares

855
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,360
Don't worry

856
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,050
I'm managing it well.

857
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,070
Yes, yes, yes

858
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,640
Later, the Lord and the Fengyang Zhao clan

859
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,300
They are all my puppets.

860
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:24,240
Uncle

861
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,560
Double to the palace

862
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,070
Double

863
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,450
We are all kind people.

864
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,170
But some people holding things

865
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,050
If you notice something

866
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,720
We might become bad people.

867
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,910
Neither the theory of human nature being good nor the theory of human nature being evil is necessary.

868
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,580
It all depends on what the other party does.

869
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,060
Be more natural Be more natural

870
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,150
Go a little inside. Go a little inside.

871
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,780
Let's go

872
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,620
It's really uncomfortable. Can you move a little?

873
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,490
Is that so?

874
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,430
Is this your elbow?

875
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,160
Stop stabbing me.

876
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,140
You're doing this to my belly

877
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,350
Really

878
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,820
You move

879
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,520
I can see you now.

880
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,540
Is it here?

881
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,530
Not this time

882
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:22,340
Yes, cheer up.

883
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,680
If I and the guard warrior

884
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,450
What can we do if two people hide?

885
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,910
Why do you have to say that?

886
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,440
Move again.

887
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,760
Find another pose.

888
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,260
Lie back

889
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,340
This is finally comfortable

890
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:53,120
I think this pose is the best.

891
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,260
It's because of your heartbeat that you were discovered.

892
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,060
Why are you so nervous?

893
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,170
Not just my heartbeat

894
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:21,130
besides

895
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:22,900
Not because of nervousness

896
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,480
Because of the central temple

897
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,590
I'm not nervous.

898
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:01,800
This is a gift from England.

899
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,270
(England-United Kingdom)
This is a gift from England.

900
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,380
(England-United Kingdom)

901
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,530
This gun is stronger and faster
(England-United Kingdom)

902
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:05,050
This gun is stronger and faster

903
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,040
If the Lord appears in the palace

904
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:15,440
Just aim at the master's heart.

905
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,820
Is this a new employee?

906
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,420
Yes

907
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,150
Come on in

908
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,300
Stop

909
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,290
search

910
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,170
Yes Yes

911
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:35,820
No abnormalities

912
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,680
(This drama is purely fictional, and the characters, groups, events, etc. that appear have nothing to do with history)

913
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,280
(Preview of the next episode)

914
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,860
As soon as the ceremony is over

915
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,020
Eliminate everyone

916
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,190
It's like in the game

917
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,930
The feeling that the final boss is about to appear

918
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,070
I just need to pick up the knife and I will fly

919
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,520
Am I crazy?

920
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,030
Because of that sentence

921
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,580
My heart is boiling again

922
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,200
If you are so worried about change

923
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,870
It has already started

924
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,820
What are you doing?

925
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,780
The king is actually in cahoots with the Eastern Bandits

926
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,930
I am the family of the people you killed.

927
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,490
I am the king of the people you trampled upon
