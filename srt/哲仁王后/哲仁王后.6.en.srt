1
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:03,963
(Mr. Queen)

2
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:06,395
(This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations, )

3
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:08,619
(and events are unrelated
to historical events.)

4
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,335
(Episode 6)

5
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,398
Right. Over here.

6
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:18,367
In the tactics section of "Wubei Zhi",

7
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,413
if there are fewer allies than enemies,

8
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:23,108
run away to a rough area.

9
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:27,408
And if you are unable to protect it,
retreat and...

10
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,647
She is a strange woman.

11
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:33,747
Gosh, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,247
She behaves strangely.

13
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:41,887
Until when should I dance
to royal ancestral rite music?

14
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,258
I...

15
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,898
served in the Special Forces.

16
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,268
- She speaks arrogantly. - Come at me.

17
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,174
You must think you're a king or something.

18
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,497
I am the king.

19
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,808
Thank you.

20
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,508
Have you lost your mind?

21
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,648
Never mind. I don't care anymore.

22
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,294
Get lost.

23
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,488
She also acts so wildly.

24
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,868
At times she makes decisions
that seem like Buddha.

25
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:28,598
So please do not hurt
those who did nothing wrong.

26
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,184
And at other times,
she gets as mad as a demon.

27
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,978
If I don't get angry in this situation,
am I a human?

28
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,413
I'd be Buddha!

29
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:37,348
In some ways, she is very human,

30
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:40,377
and trying to understand
this mysterious woman...

31
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,588
It's too late. Your understanding
means nothing now.

32
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,017
Is it really too late?

33
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,157
Was my explanation difficult?

34
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,627
- What did you say?
- You were not paying attention.

35
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,014
What were you thinking about...

36
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:01,758
that you were not paying attention
to your favorite book on tactics?

37
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:05,038
You must have been
thinking about Lady Hwa Jin.

38
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:07,638
No, I was not.

39
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:10,124
There is no need to lie.

40
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:15,024
The look in your eyes shows that
you were thinking of a woman...

41
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:16,447
I was thinking about the Queen.

42
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,924
Pardon?

43
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,188
So please refrain from saying
such uncomfortable things.

44
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,588
The Queen is a woman,

45
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,358
but you know that I do not see her as one.

46
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,534
It makes sense. Since
she is so unpredictable,

47
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,768
you are inevitably bothered by her.

48
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,814
The Queen is the most
eccentric and strange person...

49
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:38,507
I have met in my entire life.

50
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:43,078
As if she has come from a different world.

51
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,977
An expression that best
describes the Queen is...

52
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,947
Let me see.

53
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:57,334
It is a word that describes a
being from outside of this world.

54
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:58,488
Alien.

55
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:00,958
- "Alien"? - Yes.

56
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,368
It fits her very well.

57
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:09,467
Alien.

58
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:16,648
Has it finally stopped raining?

59
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,777
It was raining so hard.

60
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:21,648
I hope that nobody suffered any damages.

61
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,088
I agree.

62
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,488
I am worried.

63
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,187
Until when are you going to
speak in a weird way like that?

64
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:34,027
Until today. Just until today.

65
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:39,168
Everything will be back
to its place tomorrow! Yes!

66
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:46,178
No way.

67
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:56,518
Your Majesty!

68
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,657
Open the gates! It is the King's order!

69
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:09,898
- Open the gates! - Open the gates!

70
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:34,517
(I came here for nothing. Jang Bong Hwan)

71
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,964
Are you okay?

72
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,058
Darn it.

73
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:14,834
What are you doing?

74
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:16,418
Not too long ago, you tried to kill me.

75
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,334
I should ask you the same thing!

76
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:20,473
I cannot believe you
tried to end your life again.

77
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:21,728
Have you lost your mind?

78
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:24,944
Why do you care if I die or not?

79
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,767
Isn't it what you wanted?

80
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,877
So don't interrupt and get lost.

81
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,978
It is not too late for
me to understand you.

82
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,017
Let us do as you said.

83
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:42,747
No touching.

84
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,528
That's right. No touching.

85
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,858
- Goodness. - Darn it.

86
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:55,928
What are you doing? Let me go!

87
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,127
Darn it!

88
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,397
You said you wanted no touching,
so why are you giving up on life?

89
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,743
You want me to kill you, don't you?

90
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,113
How dare you touch me without permission?

91
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,954
It makes sense that you are angry.

92
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:11,278
I have committed a great
sin and a debt I cannot repay.

93
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:15,678
I know it all sounds like excuses,
but there was a misunderstanding.

94
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,534
Misunderstanding or not,
I don't care about your situation.

95
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,264
Please at least listen to my excuses.

96
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,187
I don't want to listen to your excuses.

97
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,428
- Move. - No.

98
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:27,704
Since I agreed to no touching,

99
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,598
I will not leave you alone.

100
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:34,813
Do you even know what no touching means?

101
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:35,837
I do.

102
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,808
I remember everything that you said to me.

103
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,978
No touching.

104
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,147
Living a happy and fun life.

105
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,577
You must live, My Queen.

106
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:51,723
You've missed out the most important word.

107
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:52,894
"Separately".

108
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,063
You live as you want, and I live as I want.

109
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:56,933
The emphasis isn't on the word "live".

110
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:59,733
It is on "separately".

111
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,334
I will do everything that I can to
abide by your no-touching rule.

112
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,567
I will look for a way for
both you and I to live.

113
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,637
Forget it. Forget about
the no-touching rule!

114
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,337
Why not?

115
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:12,714
The no-touching rule I'm talking
about is different from yours.

116
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:15,337
One small thing has made
them totally opposites.

117
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:16,978
They are not different.

118
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,877
I will prove it to you.

119
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,877
So let us follow the no-touching rule.

120
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,863
I won't follow the no-touching rule!

121
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:27,418
Let us follow the no-touching rule!

122
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,288
Darn it.

123
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,508
(Episode 6,
Between Understanding and Misunderstanding)

124
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:47,237
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

125
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:52,024
Your Majesty. What is going on?

126
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,548
Call for the Head Eunuch quickly.

127
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:57,347
I am okay, so take care of the Queen.

128
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,058
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:02,827
Your Highness.

130
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:05,388
Hurry.

131
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:16,967
(I came here for nothing. Jang Bong Hwan)

132
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,727
I missed you.

133
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,367
I also missed you.

134
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,567
Are you inside?

135
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:27,937
Yes, Father.

136
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,878
I see that you are already dressed.

137
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,418
Did you sleep well?

138
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:39,957
Yes.

139
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:44,303
I woke up early as today is
the day you enter the Palace.

140
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:47,528
I will do my best so that I do not taint...

141
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,668
your name and our family.

142
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:52,697
I'm glad it is not raining anymore.
It will be easier to get there.

143
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,614
Finish getting ready.

144
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:55,697
I will.

145
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:20,128
I was on the brink of suffocating to death.

146
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,818
Honestly, I could've been in
danger if Cheoljong didn't save me.

147
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,128
Why won't this woman come back?

148
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,408
What happened to you and the King?

149
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,308
Why did you go to the lake at this hour?

150
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,117
Are you still taking your time?

151
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:45,048
I finished wiping everything down.

152
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:54,028
When did you even leave? I
was keeping my eye on you.

153
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:58,428
Did you jump into the lake again?

154
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,398
It's not what you think.

155
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,754
Your Highness. I have brought
the outfit you can change into.

156
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,437
Then how did you get wet?

157
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:13,423
It's nothing. I was excited to
see the lake filled with water,

158
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,817
so I went swimming.

159
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:17,918
Pardon?

160
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,087
The two of you went swimming?

161
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,734
You must not do that.

162
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,187
What if you end up catching a cold?

163
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,628
Perhaps the lake isn't the way to go back.

164
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,367
This doesn't make sense.

165
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,347
Your Majesty.

166
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,418
You are here.

167
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,823
I looked everywhere for you.

168
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,548
Why were you in such a hurry...

169
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:54,758
Why are you so wet?

170
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,928
- It is nothing. - But...

171
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:47,737
My life is filled with sin,

172
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:50,408
so I will live to help you, Lady Hwa Jin.

173
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,364
I am sorry. I did not see you.

174
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,327
Did you really not see me?

175
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,313
If a person without any
power knows too much,

176
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,607
they will die in the end.

177
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,477
That is the rule of the palace.

178
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:30,687
I must live.

179
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,457
Lady Hwa Jin told me to live.

180
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:04,518
The Queen fell into the
lake again at dawn today.

181
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:08,957
But this time, the King also...

182
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:14,197
It seems like nobody
knows why they both fell in.

183
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,398
Will this be...

184
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,937
enough to prove my use to you?

185
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,538
Relay that message to the Queen Dowager.

186
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,908
Should I describe the
Queen's behaviors as they are?

187
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,008
As you relay that message to her,

188
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,154
tell me everything you
see and hear from her...

189
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:36,817
no matter how small it is.

190
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,888
It is not up to you to choose
which information is useful.

191
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:43,928
I will do as you say.

192
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,234
From now on,
you will be report to the court lady...

193
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,628
that handles the Queen's bedchamber.

194
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:55,138
Bedchamber, my lord?

195
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,937
That position comes with a high salary.

196
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,937
Thank you, my lord.

197
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,178
The Queen Dowager will think
you will be more useful to her.

198
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:07,378
And keep a close eye on the
Queen's whereabouts as well.

199
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:10,388
Yes. Leave it to me, my lord.

200
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:23,604
Should I draw a bloomed flower...

201
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,097
or a budding flower?

202
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,398
What do you think, O Wol?

203
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,678
His Majesty is the only one...

204
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,178
I have left now.

205
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:44,918
Your Highness, the Queen Dowager is here.

206
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,357
Hello, Your Highness.

207
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,857
You were drawing orchids.

208
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:01,998
Is it finished?

209
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:03,738
Not yet.

210
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,938
I have not decided whether
to add a flower or a bud.

211
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:09,407
Let me see.

212
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,218
In my opinion, a budding flower will do.

213
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,617
It will make them curious and wonder...

214
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:21,157
what kind of flower it will be.

215
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,637
Gosh, how beautiful.

216
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,647
I hope the buds would
not face any misfortunes...

217
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,778
of withering away without
being able to bloom.

218
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,117
Oh, right.

219
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,288
I came here because I
have a small gift for you.

220
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:08,798
Thank you.

221
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,444
I did not know what you liked,

222
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,628
so it took me some time
as I gave it a lot of thought.

223
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:25,288
I heard that you are an excellent archer.

224
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,887
I am planning to learn archery myself.

225
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,458
I prepared some for you
as I got them for myself.

226
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,367
These are beautiful and strong arrows.

227
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:40,397
Thank you.

228
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,238
That is not the real gift, though.

229
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:47,583
The real gift will be delivered...

230
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,808
to His Majesty during
the meeting in court today.

231
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,018
Where if not the lake?

232
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,988
The only thing in common is water.

233
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,528
There's one more.

234
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:12,367
Both of us were on the verge of death.

235
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,274
Oh, my. What if I try it
and really end up dying?

236
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,067
Dying hurts so much.

237
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,208
I'm sure there is a safe
and peaceful way to go back.

238
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,478
I should understand this woman first.

239
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:32,018
I am Kim So Yong.

240
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:35,018
I ended myself.

241
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:38,228
"Desert your false self"?

242
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,528
"Desert your false self"?

243
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,667
Why did I try to kill myself?
Because I don't want to live.

244
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,768
Of course, that's why she won't come back.

245
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,538
This woman... Did she run away from home?

246
00:20:58,177 --> 00:20:59,937
I finally understand
why you are doing this.

247
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,524
You obsess over the lake...

248
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,317
and keep mumbling to yourself.

249
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:06,488
Right now, you are...

250
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:12,387
trying to get your memories back, right?

251
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,397
Yes. That's right.

252
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,127
Okay.

253
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,914
That brings me to this
question. When I fell into the lake,

254
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,458
you said I didn't wake up
although I was pulled out right away.

255
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,268
Yes.

256
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:27,238
Darn it. I knew it. She ran away.

257
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:30,038
This isn't fair.

258
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,048
I want to go back.

259
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,417
This is kidnapping!

260
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:39,047
The grilled gizzard shad
can bring back runaway wives.

261
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,417
But memorial services for
spirits who left their bodies?

262
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,528
A ritual?

263
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,633
Yes. I should hold a huge ritual.

264
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,697
I will plaster this place
with expensive talismans.

265
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,667
Are you outside, Court Lady Choi?

266
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:01,978
Is there anyone who
specializes in rituals or talismans?

267
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:04,208
Pardon?

268
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:07,117
You should not take an
interest in shamanism,

269
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,117
but you will end up doing it anyway, right?

270
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:16,117
There is one person that
comes to my mind now.

271
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:18,458
But what?

272
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:31,238
Why did she come all the way
here? What does she want to know?

273
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:34,177
To what do I owe this pleasure?

274
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:37,048
I heard you were the expert.

275
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:40,278
I am? In what?

276
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:43,988
I need some spiritual guidance.

277
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,958
Things like rituals or talismans.

278
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,803
Did she figure out that
I got a new talisman...

279
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,288
to curse her?

280
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,827
My gosh. How vulgar.

281
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,067
Why do you need such items?

282
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,897
It's not a big deal.

283
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:05,867
I need to bring in a spirit
that has left the body.

284
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,278
I'm sure this happens often. You know?

285
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:12,847
She is cleverly trying to bond with me.

286
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,194
I am sure she wants to
expose me for having talismans.

287
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:17,647
What a sly fox.

288
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,518
I do not believe in such things.

289
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:24,387
Like ghosts or spirits.

290
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:30,097
Then, what is the purpose of this place?

291
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:39,137
You got the wrong idea.

292
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,407
This is not a shamanistic place.

293
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,877
This is where I cleanse my heart.

294
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:45,778
I see.

295
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:49,647
What is this?

296
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:51,587
Seriously?

297
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:57,188
But whose spirit are you trying to summon?

298
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:02,798
Should I say we are very intimate or tight?

299
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,403
It's a woman, so don't get the wrong idea.

300
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,567
I see.

301
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:12,468
It must be your mother
whom you have never seen.

302
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:18,147
My gosh. My heart breaks for you.

303
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,823
You must be lonely in the palace.

304
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:23,048
But you must miss your late mother.

305
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:24,647
Is that why...

306
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:27,657
you were trying to end your life?

307
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,587
Is that what you think?

308
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,728
You can tell me everything.

309
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:37,543
I did not give birth to the King...

310
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,637
but based on the genealogy,
I am his mother.

311
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:46,008
Starting today, I will cherish you
as my daughter and take good care...

312
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,008
I already have two mothers.

313
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:53,924
But the truth is,
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

314
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,948
Then, why did you say that
you were trying to end your life?

315
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:58,788
Exactly.

316
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:00,817
Why on earth did I do that?

317
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:03,488
So you want me to guess?

318
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:07,228
It means she has an ulterior motive.

319
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,298
So she is threatening me and
saying that I should be on my toes.

320
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,966
Darn it. That wasn't helpful at all.

321
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,637
The royal conference has not been held yet.

322
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:29,677
But she is making a move
already to threaten me?

323
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:34,393
Court Lady Han,
they must also have a little bird...

324
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,087
that delivers rumors to them.

325
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:40,157
Pardon? But who would do that?

326
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:45,557
She barged in confidently
and dropped clues on purpose,

327
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:50,296
so it must be someone
we cannot figure out easily.

328
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,667
Contact the fortune-teller, Court Lady Han.

329
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:58,706
I must get a reading.

330
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:05,452
She was tormented by something,
so she tried to take her own life.

331
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,162
But she couldn't even die.

332
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:08,866
So her soul was like, "Whatever. I'm out."

333
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:12,286
And she's not returning.

334
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,456
What was she tormented by?

335
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,303
The Grand Queen Dowager said
she didn't want to become Queen.

336
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,397
Why not?

337
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:21,667
Because Cheoljong didn't love her...

338
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,466
and was head over heels for another woman?

339
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,343
Gosh, no way.

340
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,527
Did she try to take her
own life because of that jerk?

341
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:33,553
Her Highness is talking
to herself more than usual.

342
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,123
Many are listening.

343
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:37,022
That is the least of my concerns.

344
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:40,046
I nag her about it,
but I should really let it go.

345
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,186
She will kill someone soon at this rate.

346
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:47,803
But then again,
I know this now that I've experienced it.

347
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:50,873
Being a queen is like
sitting in a barless prison.

348
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:54,002
From a noble family and
chosen to become Queen,

349
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,442
which means she never really dated.

350
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,236
She probably had never even
seen a boy until she met Cheoljong.

351
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,982
And given the fact that
he is King and all that,

352
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:03,877
I understand why she fell hard for him.

353
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:10,353
Hold on a second. She must
be having a lot of fun right now.

354
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:12,722
After leading an ascetic
lifestyle all her life,

355
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:14,917
she experienced a new world.

356
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:19,456
What if this woman is...

357
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,186
She'd better not be doing
funny things with my body!

358
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:38,807
What the...

359
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,427
Stop!

360
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:00,667
Come back at once. I'm
going to teach you a lesson!

361
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,067
You won't come back?

362
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,466
What is so interesting
that you are all staring at it?

363
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,436
Then I'm going to...

364
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,706
stab your body. Until it bleeds!

365
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:13,377
It'll hurt, big-time.

366
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:18,446
You don't think I can do it? I'm doing it,
okay? Here we go!

367
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:26,587
Gosh, that hurts.

368
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:32,296
This time, I'm actually
going to do it until I see blood.

369
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:38,657
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

370
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:40,667
That really hurt!

371
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,336
- It hurt so much. - Let me help you up.

372
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,752
It hurt...

373
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:49,077
- My gosh. - I have reached my limits.

374
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:53,786
Coming back, not coming back.

375
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:55,617
Coming back.

376
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,016
Not coming back.

377
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:05,057
More?

378
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:07,972
Your Highness, please do not be concerned.

379
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,966
It will return when the time is right.

380
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:14,036
But by then, I would already be...

381
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:23,147
Calling the spirit.

382
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,546
Are you here?

383
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:30,387
Calling the spirit.

384
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:32,617
Are you here?

385
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,756
Since we're sharing each other's bodies,

386
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,857
let's have an open, candid conversation.

387
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,756
You are talking to yourself again,
Your Highness?

388
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:48,706
Consider this a self-conducted exorcism...

389
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:51,813
or a conversation with the self.

390
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:53,682
What will you do if strange rumors spread?

391
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:56,482
Word travels exceptionally
fast in the palace.

392
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:58,476
What is that? It looks nice.

393
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,692
His Majesty bestowed this
upon Your Highness as a gift.

394
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,917
I went and got it for you.

395
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,196
("Changes of Zhou")

396
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:16,996
There is something inside.

397
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:19,272
(No touching.)

398
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:22,206
My gosh! How pretty.

399
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,412
Gosh, look at him going on about this.

400
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:28,276
When I wanted to do it,
he turned me down. So why now?

401
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:36,262
Did you catch a cold?

402
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:37,863
I knew this would happen.

403
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:40,486
You got soaked in the rain
and even played in the water.

404
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:42,827
Gosh, what do I do with you?

405
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:46,597
Yeon.

406
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:50,303
This isn't a cold.

407
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:51,613
Then what is it?

408
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:52,897
This is...

409
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:56,736
a disease called despair.

410
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:00,697
I thought everything would be
resolved once the lake filled up.

411
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,298
You see, hope is such a cruel thing.

412
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,838
To regain memory,
you even wanted to do a shamanic ritual.

413
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:13,538
I hope you can stop trying so hard.

414
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:16,038
If you had a lot of good memories,

415
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,778
you would not have
tried to take your own life.

416
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,354
For the sake of your happiness,

417
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:22,923
maybe it is better that it never returns...

418
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,447
No! It must return.

419
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,457
I can't live like this.

420
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:35,173
I'll tell the royal kitchen to make
foods that can help treat your cold.

421
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,117
Your Highness should
eat that and get some rest.

422
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,673
No, I will make this woman surrender...

423
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:43,937
and come back of her own accord,
at all costs.

424
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,554
Here, blow your nose.

425
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:53,008
Hey, don't treat me like
a kid. I'm not an idiot.

426
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,848
One more time.

427
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:05,957
- Eunuch Cha. - Yes, sir.

428
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:12,628
Your Majesty, you have a cold.
Please return to your chamber.

429
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,697
No, this is not a cold.

430
00:32:14,997 --> 00:32:16,368
This is...

431
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,538
I suppose it is a cold. You were right.

432
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:25,984
Still no word from Daejojeon Hall?

433
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:28,917
- No, Your Majesty.
- Did she receive the book?

434
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:30,548
Yes, Your Majesty.

435
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:35,018
Of course, it would not be
easy to open a closed heart.

436
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:37,258
I have a favor to ask of you.

437
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,858
I need you to get me something precious.

438
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:44,598
By "something precious", do you mean...

439
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:48,897
What are you thinking?

440
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,854
We hereby appoint Kim Byeong In...

441
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,947
as the head of the Department of Justice.

442
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,447
I trust that you will
excel in this position.

443
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:04,588
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

444
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,703
I have heard so much about
you. The youngest to pass...

445
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,767
the civil service exam
and skilled in martial arts.

446
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:20,643
Despite all your knowledge
and talent in martial arts,

447
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,514
you had been refusing to
accept a post in the government,

448
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:25,113
which left everyone curious.

449
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,338
What prompted you to
change your mind this time?

450
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,867
"One must save one's
country in times of crisis."

451
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,794
At this time of crisis,
I wish to contribute...

452
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:36,947
to restoring order in this nation.

453
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:42,887
"Crisis"?

454
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:46,764
My goodness, the ministers must
have been keeping it from me...

455
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:48,304
for they did not want to cause me concern.

456
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:51,244
Who is it this time? Qing or the Japanese?

457
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:53,798
An internal crisis...

458
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:56,467
is more dangerous than an external one.

459
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,484
There is an internal crisis
that never existed before?

460
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,147
That must mean...

461
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,457
Oh, I have a cold.

462
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:22,227
Gosh, a sage king ought to
know how to look after his health.

463
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,367
Open wide.

464
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:36,484
You must return to your chamber...

465
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,354
and get some rest after you finish this.

466
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:41,354
No, I'll stay out here so
my cold will get worse.

467
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:42,538
I'm going to abuse this body.

468
00:34:43,278 --> 00:34:44,663
It's not my body anyway.

469
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,117
I'll never let it stay warm and full.

470
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,218
I want more.

471
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:56,698
Your Highness,

472
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,628
abusing your body would not
help you regain your memory.

473
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,944
It will only cause you pain.

474
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:04,513
You keep saying that it is not your body,

475
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,108
but it is yours even though
your memories are gone.

476
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:10,108
Who will suffer? You, of course.

477
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,283
Even without your memories,

478
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:15,517
I am sure you will have a happy life.

479
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:18,988
Look at the sky. The weather
is great today. How nice is it?

480
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:26,488
Right. It's free of fine dust.

481
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:33,267
The breeze carries the
smell of fresh compost.

482
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,497
Korean food for all three meals.

483
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,614
Yes, this is enough to make me happy.

484
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,307
Of course. I'm happy with it.

485
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,307
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:50,178
Your Highness, are you crying?

487
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:53,147
No. I'm not crying. I am so happy.

488
00:35:53,888 --> 00:35:55,134
Like you said,

489
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:57,358
I'll try to like this place
and live a happy life here.

490
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:01,997
Are you that sad because
your memories are not returning?

491
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,068
This is an appeal from tens
of people from the court...

492
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:14,084
including myself as we
are greatly worried about...

493
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,807
the Queen's state.

494
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,508
What on earth...

495
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:20,307
Are you discussing to depose the Queen?

496
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:22,893
- What? - What?

497
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:26,517
The Queen habitually tries to end her life,

498
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,588
so we would like to
strengthen the Internal Court.

499
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:33,928
I ask you to consider deposing the Queen.

500
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:38,997
The Queen has made a false
statement in order to keep...

501
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:41,873
Royal Noble Consort Eui safe.

502
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:44,444
After falling into the lake,
her mind has been ill.

503
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,444
She confuses herself with someone else.

504
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:48,783
And whenever she looks at the water,
she jumps and tries to kill herself.

505
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,307
Everyone is gossiping about that!

506
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:52,953
If you believe gossips
have any truth to them,

507
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,924
the gossip that Royal Noble Consort Eui...

508
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:57,964
had pushed the Queen also must be true.

509
00:36:57,988 --> 00:36:59,223
What?

510
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,017
- How dare you? - Hey.

511
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,858
Be quiet!

512
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:08,557
I will dismiss this appeal as
it was not handled properly.

513
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:11,303
You must file this
properly to Seungjeongwon.

514
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:14,373
However, I can guarantee
you this as I am her husband,

515
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,068
the closest person to observe her.

516
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:20,037
Her mind is not ill.

517
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,924
- However... - Things are getting heated.

518
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:28,117
I'd like to ask to end the
royal conference here for today.

519
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,448
Let us.

520
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,088
Your Highness.

521
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,263
What brings you here, my cousin?

522
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:41,997
I heard that you were here.

523
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,397
Did you hear the news?

524
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:50,238
- What? - His Majesty is here.

525
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:52,307
My Queen.

526
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:57,283
You are already here.

527
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,108
You are the one who is late, Your Majesty.

528
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,088
I thought perhaps, I was being sensitive,

529
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,024
but it is no secret that my head
of the Department of Justice...

530
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,488
is unhappy with me.

531
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:06,964
Head of the Department of Justice?

532
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:10,364
You dismissed and humiliated the Queen...

533
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,787
who had saved your
lover in front of everyone.

534
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:16,597
I can picture how you have been
treating the Queen all this time.

535
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:19,637
Perhaps,
that must be why she tried to end her life.

536
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:23,767
Well, don't look at me.

537
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:26,944
In the end,
the Queen is in a predicament because...

538
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:28,878
she saved Royal Noble Consort Eui.

539
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,723
- What will you do then?
- In a predicament?

540
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:34,254
I will not let her be in a predicament.

541
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,687
How? What can you do?

542
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,163
Are you crossing the line...

543
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,187
as the Queen's cousin...

544
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,957
or as the adopted son of Lord Kim Jwa Geun?

545
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:50,658
You have no power to protect her.

546
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,097
I am objectively telling
you what I am seeing.

547
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:55,767
I have no power?

548
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,008
I agree.

549
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:05,147
However,
I do not have to defeat power with power.

550
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:07,778
There is a way to defeat it
in a peaceful and safe way.

551
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,818
If it requires me to be more peaceful,
I will be.

552
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:13,088
If it means to protect the Queen,

553
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,057
I will stay weak as long as anyone wants.

554
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,388
There is no need for that.

555
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,988
I will protect the Queen.

556
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:26,397
It is faster to defeat
power with more power.

557
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,878
Hey.

558
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:38,953
What's going on here?

559
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,354
It sounds like it's my problem.

560
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,738
Why are you two fighting about it?

561
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,318
What's going on with
me? What is it this time?

562
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,548
I received an appeal to depose you,
My Queen.

563
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,928
Gosh. Right after I decided
to try to like this place?

564
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:53,703
They were eager to kill me before.

565
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,327
Now, they want to kick me out.

566
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:57,798
Who brought up to depose you before today?

567
00:39:58,867 --> 00:40:00,727
The Grand Queen Dowager was angry at me.

568
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:03,867
I will talk to her.

569
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,437
I do have a solution in mind.

570
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:11,207
Oh, no. You caught a cold too, My Queen.

571
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,278
You too?

572
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:20,794
Although this is urgent,

573
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,358
you must go back inside and rest.

574
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:27,858
If that is everything you wanted to say,
leave us be.

575
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:30,528
We must discuss something
as a husband and a wife.

576
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,867
There is something I must tell you,
so I will wait.

577
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:38,508
- I will come back again. - Okay.

578
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:49,893
I was going to wait until
you had an answer for me.

579
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,287
But I am running out of time.

580
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:55,017
Starting now,
I will follow the no-touching rule.

581
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,734
Why are you bringing that up now?

582
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,998
If you do not wish to follow it,
I will follow it alone.

583
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:01,727
No touching.

584
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,573
You misunderstood that.

585
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,767
- Give me your hand. - Why?

586
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:09,068
What are you doing?

587
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:25,287
My life...

588
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:29,117
was always in the hands of your clan.

589
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:32,358
I must have been blinded by that.

590
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,758
I failed to see that you are also
an innocent woman who is trying...

591
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:40,227
to make the best of what you have.

592
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:43,537
I am sorry that it took me so long.

593
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,138
Please give me one more chance.

594
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:50,408
A chance to understand you...

595
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:55,017
as an individual without any prejudices.

596
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:00,993
You didn't have to do that.

597
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,617
I know you are not fond of big gestures.

598
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,734
But I should apologize to
you properly at least once.

599
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:07,933
Suit yourself.

600
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:09,628
Fine. Let's do it. No touching.

601
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,528
I'm in no place to turn down anyone.

602
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:18,437
Then, today is our first day.

603
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:20,343
What?

604
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:22,077
The first day of our no-touching rule.

605
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,384
- Don't say something like that. - Why not?

606
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,647
Just don't. Never say that again.

607
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:30,524
What is wrong with what I said?

608
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,794
Today is our first day.

609
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:34,117
My gosh. Just don't say that!

610
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,163
I mean, saying today is our first day...

611
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:39,827
Stop it!

612
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:42,727
I bet you know what that means, right?

613
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:45,274
Today is our first day...

614
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:47,473
Stop it. That's so disgusting!

615
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:48,814
- But it is our first day. - Stop it.

616
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:50,298
- Our... - Stop it.

617
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,338
Then, now that we have settled on that,

618
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,508
I will do my best to protect you.

619
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:00,178
Right. I have no time to waste either.

620
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:01,778
Bye.

621
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:05,218
Wait. Please do not run. Do not...

622
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:08,158
You might get hurt.

623
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:23,997
Go ahead.

624
00:43:24,537 --> 00:43:28,307
If the Queen is unhappy,
you will be unhappy too.

625
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:31,508
- Is that a threat? - Just my concern.

626
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:37,964
You are only her cousin,
but you are way too overprotective.

627
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:40,388
No, you are way too indifferent,
Your Majesty.

628
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,818
I know I do not hold much power,

629
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,258
but there are proprieties to follow.

630
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:48,727
If you cross the line again,

631
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,727
I will raise a question
regarding your behaviors.

632
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,037
Please go ahead.

633
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,108
I will make you write...

634
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:03,008
a very lengthy apology letter.

635
00:44:05,747 --> 00:44:07,908
A very long one.

636
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,878
You might have to stay up all night.

637
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:14,048
And your fingers will hurt.

638
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,683
Do they truly believe she can be deposed?

639
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:33,108
Because of that mere appeal?

640
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:36,207
They are trying to gather
power through the appeal.

641
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:39,608
They will gather people
who dislike our clan...

642
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,577
and increase the number
of appeals. It is very obvious.

643
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:46,347
How dare they make
their move so recklessly?

644
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,893
We were bound to go
through this at least once.

645
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,617
Your Highness,

646
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:53,128
the Queen is here.

647
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,298
Show Her Highness in.

648
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:20,187
I apologize deeply for worrying you.

649
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:26,158
I deserved to be deposed.

650
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,358
However, even if I get deposed,

651
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:32,803
the Grand Queen Dowager must depose me.

652
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:36,867
It is not right for a member of
the Pungyang Jo clan to do so.

653
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:41,453
No matter how foolish you may be,
nobody can bear to see...

654
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:43,477
someone boss around
one of their subordinates.

655
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,823
This is a matter of pride.

656
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:48,694
If I get deposed by someone
from the Pungyang Jo clan,

657
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:50,548
it will not be my loss,

658
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:53,117
it will be the loss of the Andong Kim clan.

659
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:56,564
If you are so aware of that,

660
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,533
how could you do something
to be accountable for?

661
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:00,287
What they rely on are the rumors.

662
00:46:00,787 --> 00:46:02,234
I will take care of it.

663
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:03,274
How will you do that?

664
00:46:03,298 --> 00:46:04,803
You must never let a
good crisis go to waste.

665
00:46:04,827 --> 00:46:07,404
If you give me a bit of time,
I will take this opportunity...

666
00:46:07,428 --> 00:46:09,897
to change my reputation.

667
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:22,993
Today, the King took your side...

668
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:25,287
when he received the appeal.

669
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,258
Cheoljong, that jerk, did?

670
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:31,803
The fact that the Queen took action...

671
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:34,227
did not go to waste.

672
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:40,997
I must give the Queen
Dowager Jo a proper lesson.

673
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:44,537
I must show her who
the owner of this palace is.

674
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:52,578
Are these all the palanquin bearers?

675
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:54,993
The thing is...

676
00:46:55,017 --> 00:46:56,794
Select some more. Make sure they're funny.

677
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:58,488
Yes, Your Highness. Funny.

678
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:00,787
Pardon?

679
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,988
Make sure they are tall
and have nice bodies.

680
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:07,758
Obviously, they must be young too.

681
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,167
Are you really choosing palanquin bearers?

682
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,368
I'm not simply choosing riders
to carry the food palanquins.

683
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,758
You'll be surprised when you find out.

684
00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:23,778
What I'm choosing is...

685
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:35,818
- Right. Did you hear the rumors?
- What rumors?

686
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,504
The Queen did not try to commit suicide.

687
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:41,088
She was trying to save the King
and the Royal Noble Consort Eui.

688
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,544
She was trying to save the King
and the Royal Noble Consort Eui,

689
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:47,728
so she lied and said she
was trying to commit suicide.

690
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:48,897
Gosh, it's hot.

691
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:51,044
- Is it family... - Or husband.

692
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,783
- That is... - The question.

693
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:56,108
As a result, she lost the confidence
of the Grand Queen Dowager...

694
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:59,207
But the Queen put a silver
knife to her throat and said...

695
00:47:59,448 --> 00:48:02,117
"I will escape from this unlucky fate..."

696
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,747
"where I cannot choose either side."

697
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,588
That is what she said.

698
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:09,258
She was the witch of the royal villa.

699
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:10,695
According to the rumors,

700
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,488
she experienced a world of paradise.

701
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:15,298
Because she fell into the lake?

702
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:17,904
After she met the Great Jade Emperor,

703
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,497
she transformed into a fairy.

704
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,678
This is good.

705
00:48:29,278 --> 00:48:31,678
I'm not simply choosing riders
to carry the food palanquins.

706
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,254
I'm choosing storytellers.

707
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:36,878
They're human tabloids who
will spread rumors like a disease.

708
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:38,917
Pardon?

709
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:42,388
When rumors begin spreading,
it ends up becoming infectious.

710
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:45,437
It spreads so fast that not even the
person who started them can stop it.

711
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:48,128
It also evolves in unexpected ways.

712
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:50,634
But if she did not try to commit suicide,

713
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:53,667
that means that the person who
pushed the Queen into the lake...

714
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:58,314
Does that mean that the
Queen risked her life...

715
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:00,108
to save the concubine
who tried to kill her?

716
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:03,388
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my goodness.

717
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:09,678
I suddenly have chills.

718
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,548
You must really get some rest now.

719
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,364
This will not do. I
will carry you if I must.

720
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:18,687
Gosh. All right.

721
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,858
Now that Court Lady Choi doesn't nag me,
you do.

722
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:24,158
Is there a law of conservation of nagging?

723
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:28,897
I haven't seen Court
Lady Choi for a while now.

724
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:31,097
It's so cold.

725
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,437
Can you hug me a bit tighter? It's cold.

726
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:15,347
Your Highness!

727
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:18,493
How could you hurt yourself?

728
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:21,933
Do you want to see me lose my mind?

729
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:25,158
How could you go swimming with the King?

730
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:28,573
Do you intend to put the nation in danger?

731
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:30,634
A talisman? A ritual?

732
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:34,073
You must not participate
in such superstitions.

733
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,973
You must not speak like that either!

734
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:40,913
Everything from 1 to 10,

735
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:45,307
you must not do any of it!

736
00:50:56,287 --> 00:51:00,457
I do not feel refreshed
even after doing this.

737
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:04,358
If I nag her,
Her Highness will be troubled.

738
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:09,338
If I do not nag her, I am troubled.

739
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:14,867
What can I do about this?

740
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:26,588
Your Highness!

741
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:30,177
- Did you hear the rumors? - Pardon?

742
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:32,411
Everyone in the Palace is talking about it.

743
00:51:32,612 --> 00:51:35,387
They said that the Queen risked her life...

744
00:51:35,411 --> 00:51:37,141
to save you, who tried to kill her.

745
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:39,181
Who would say such things?

746
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:41,782
Did the Queen say that?

747
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:45,028
She changed the rumors that
she was the witch of the royal villa...

748
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:47,367
to say that she is like Buddha,
a fairy, and a virtuous woman.

749
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:49,922
She managed to get
everyone to change their tune.

750
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:55,732
From now on, people will curse
you and say you are a wicked woman.

751
00:51:57,732 --> 00:52:00,271
This was her plan from the start.

752
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:04,302
She came to see me at Seoneonjeon Hall,
and she threatened me.

753
00:52:04,342 --> 00:52:05,572
This was why.

754
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,741
I will visit with the King and tell him...

755
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:12,982
so that he does not get fooled
by the Queen's lies anymore.

756
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:15,112
I am not sure about that.

757
00:52:16,322 --> 00:52:19,692
Will he believe in what you say?

758
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:23,322
The King will believe in what I tell him.

759
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:27,262
The King rejected the appeal
for the Queen's dethronement.

760
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:35,371
The Royal Noble Consort Eui is here.

761
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:41,572
Hwa Jin.

762
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:46,911
I was about to visit you as I had
something to discuss with you.

763
00:52:48,112 --> 00:52:50,081
What did you want to speak with me about?

764
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:52,261
During today's council before the throne,

765
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:55,462
I received an appeal for
the Queen's dethronement.

766
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:58,391
Is that so?

767
00:52:58,621 --> 00:53:01,331
The Queen was put in
danger in order to save us,

768
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,931
and I thought it would
not be right to stay quiet.

769
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:08,802
So I would like to ask the
Royal Secretariat to withdraw it.

770
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:10,601
Is that okay with you?

771
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:14,247
Do you want me to ask my father?

772
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:17,911
He is highly respected,
and many people follow him.

773
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:23,052
Is this a hard request?

774
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,021
No, it is not.

775
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:31,262
I will write a message to my father myself.

776
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:33,592
Thank you.

777
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:34,762
Your Majesty.

778
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:38,601
There is something I have
always wanted when I came here.

779
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:42,347
Just like when we first met,
I hope you can forget...

780
00:53:42,371 --> 00:53:44,241
all the things you fear
when you are with me.

781
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,572
I want to be that kind of person to you.

782
00:53:49,782 --> 00:53:52,282
You are already a big comfort to me.

783
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:55,681
I apologize,

784
00:53:56,982 --> 00:53:59,052
but we have not spent
the night together yet.

785
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:06,192
I have made you lonely.

786
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:09,278
I know that you have been busy.

787
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:10,831
I was not thinking straight.

788
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:13,502
I will visit your chamber tonight.

789
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:17,478
However, you and the Queen are supposed...

790
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:18,982
to spend the night together tomorrow.

791
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:21,411
Do not worry about that.

792
00:54:22,712 --> 00:54:25,117
Then I shall meet her to comfort her.

793
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:26,861
And I will write a letter right after that.

794
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:28,612
Good idea.

795
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:39,668
Royal Noble Consort Eui
is here to see the Queen.

796
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:41,838
I apologize. Her Highness has a cold,

797
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,938
so she took some herbal tonic...

798
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:45,632
and just fell asleep.

799
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:47,931
Too bad.

800
00:54:48,572 --> 00:54:49,772
I will come back another time.

801
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:04,121
You're here.

802
00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:08,252
You were fast asleep like
a puppy napping in spring...

803
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:16,431
I heard you are not feeling well.

804
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:21,371
I'm not feeling the greatest,

805
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:25,512
but I have no regrets since
it was for the sake of justice.

806
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:29,241
- "Justice"? - Let's not stand around here.

807
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:30,911
Come on in.

808
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:42,092
Give us some privacy so...

809
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:45,262
I mean, so we can relax and catch up.

810
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,212
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

811
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:15,152
Why are you sitting so far away?

812
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:18,221
This makes me feel distant from you.

813
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:21,037
Come closer.

814
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:22,192
No, I am okay here.

815
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:27,601
Then I shall come closer.

816
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:30,278
I showed up like a
prince and saved her life,

817
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:32,842
so those cold eyes should
be filled with love now...

818
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:37,782
What? How come...

819
00:56:39,052 --> 00:56:40,287
The look in your eyes has changed,

820
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:42,982
but why colder than before?

821
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:46,252
I will withdraw the appeal.

822
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:50,491
So I am no longer indebted to you.

823
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:53,891
Thank you.

824
00:56:54,232 --> 00:56:58,032
I bet you are thinking that
everything is going your way.

825
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,371
No, I'm not.

826
00:57:00,802 --> 00:57:02,572
Nothing's going my way.

827
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:04,591
You lost His Majesty because of those lies,

828
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:06,988
so you will lie to get him back?

829
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,172
What are you talking about?

830
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,612
I'm not the most honest person,
but I never lie.

831
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:14,552
I knew you would play dumb.

832
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:16,752
No, I'm not playing dumb.

833
00:57:19,922 --> 00:57:21,491
And I've told you numerous times.

834
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:25,061
I really have no interest
in the King whatsoever.

835
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:27,791
All right, then.

836
00:57:28,632 --> 00:57:30,831
I will trust you on that.

837
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:35,847
Why don't we do something
tonight to build a stronger friendship?

838
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:37,278
How about a pajama party...

839
00:57:37,302 --> 00:57:40,318
I mean, an undergarment party.

840
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:43,882
I am spending the night with His Majesty.

841
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:46,612
Why?

842
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:48,911
And on top of that,

843
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:52,252
did you really have to
tell me this in person?

844
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:55,521
This bluntly? In this hurtful manner?

845
00:57:56,862 --> 00:58:00,008
You seem quite upset for someone
who has no interest whatsoever.

846
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:01,568
I said I had no interest in the King.

847
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:03,732
I never said I wasn't interested in you.

848
00:58:04,462 --> 00:58:07,132
Prove to me that your
kindness toward me is sincere.

849
00:58:07,572 --> 00:58:10,902
If your words and actions
fail to match once again,

850
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:15,041
I, too, will fight with all my might.

851
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:20,882
Since you're so determined,
I should give up.

852
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:23,721
Okay, fine.

853
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:27,922
I'll give up and send my
blessings to the two of you.

854
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:30,092
It's your loss.

855
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:32,362
Too bad you failed to recognize my charm.

856
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:34,831
I shall leave now.

857
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:48,072
She's a difficult one.

858
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:52,712
That cruel woman.

859
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:12,632
15, 20...

860
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,572
How can I help you?

861
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:24,581
I feel awfully frustrated and distressed.

862
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:27,982
I am here to heal my frustrated heart.

863
00:59:28,252 --> 00:59:30,652
You came to the wrong place.

864
00:59:31,252 --> 00:59:33,822
We sell pretty much everything here,

865
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:36,021
but we don't sell medicine.

866
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,398
I have to close up now.

867
00:59:38,422 --> 00:59:39,862
Please. This way.

868
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:42,931
- Well... - This way, please.

869
00:59:45,532 --> 00:59:46,931
That precious thing.

870
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:48,871
What?

871
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:54,271
You know, that precious object from Qing.

872
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:37,982
I asked the two of you to
meet with me to go over...

873
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,391
what was discussed at the royal conference.

874
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,568
How dare they discuss
the deposal of the Queen?

875
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:45,991
They are attacking the
entire Andong Kim clan!

876
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,668
The royal court with a queen...

877
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:51,061
who can jump into the lake anytime.

878
01:00:51,262 --> 01:00:53,302
How precarious!

879
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:56,402
How dare you slander the Queen?

880
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:59,588
You'd better not run your mouth like that.

881
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:00,971
Run my mouth?

882
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:06,012
I did not come here to
put up with such an insult.

883
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:18,962
What are you doing?

884
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:21,161
Are you trying to provoke me?

885
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:31,672
I am simply asking you
to stay to hear the rest.

886
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:33,271
You little...

887
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:49,192
Like I mentioned earlier,
no one in this room is losing.

888
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:52,862
So would you please stay and hear me out?

889
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:58,002
Have a seat.

890
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:17,052
I am not sure if you would remember this.

891
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:21,422
The letter Queen Dowager
sent to Royal Noble Consort Eui.

892
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:24,692
The location, date,
and time written in this letter...

893
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:27,991
coincide with when and where
the Queen's accident took place.

894
01:02:29,092 --> 01:02:30,762
That letter is fake.

895
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:33,572
Can you prove that it is fake?

896
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:40,881
This letter and the appeal
for the Queen's dethronement.

897
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:45,012
I would like us to exchange the two.

898
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:47,851
This deal will ensure
that the two families...

899
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:51,057
will never have to be distressed
about the same issue again.

900
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,291
That is my offer.

901
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:57,322
What do you say?

902
01:03:16,782 --> 01:03:17,942
Did Your Highness ask for me?

903
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:21,982
I wrote the letter His Majesty
had asked me to write.

904
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:25,351
Could you deliver this to my father?

905
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:29,521
I will...

906
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:32,121
persuade His Majesty.

907
01:03:32,462 --> 01:03:36,362
His Majesty is genuinely
trying to return the favor.

908
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:39,762
Although the Queen is probably
feeling differently about it.

909
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:44,072
However, what matters to
me is how His Majesty feels.

910
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:48,442
So it is okay.

911
01:03:49,982 --> 01:03:53,282
Your Highness, we are ready for your bath.

912
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:21,512
So far, it is okay.

913
01:04:30,282 --> 01:04:31,482
Queen Dowager.

914
01:04:32,152 --> 01:04:34,021
Has everything been well with you?

915
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:38,322
No, I have not been well.
That is why I asked to see you.

916
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:44,831
I feel awfully anxious and worried again.

917
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,072
Please calm down.

918
01:04:49,172 --> 01:04:51,771
I will help you find the
answer you are looking for.

919
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:19,907
His Majesty is getting ready to
visit Her Highness's chamber.

920
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:21,431
I must speak to His Majesty.

921
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:24,072
Give us some privacy.

922
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:26,842
Yes, Your Majesty.

923
01:05:35,212 --> 01:05:37,372
Deposing the Queen will
grant us the chance we needed.

924
01:05:37,422 --> 01:05:40,197
Your Majesty,
why are you trying to stop it?

925
01:05:40,221 --> 01:05:41,728
Even if we go that route,

926
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:43,692
she will simply be
replaced with someone else.

927
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:47,438
The Queen has been making
decisions that are in favor of us.

928
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:49,307
Out of everyone who
can occupy that position,

929
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:51,161
she is the best option for us.

930
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:54,132
Is she making you waver?

931
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:01,541
Please answer my question.
Is she making you waver?

932
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,482
Yes.

933
01:06:04,512 --> 01:06:05,782
She is.

934
01:06:06,882 --> 01:06:10,128
She risked her life to save her husband,
who had tried to kill her,

935
01:06:10,152 --> 01:06:12,351
as well as the woman
her husband is in love with.

936
01:06:12,621 --> 01:06:13,867
Not because she is boundlessly merciful,

937
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,128
and not because she has forgiven me.

938
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:17,621
She did it because she could
not turn away from the truth.

939
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:21,137
She never even expected
me to apologize or thank her.

940
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:23,807
She quietly did what she
thought was right for justice's sake,

941
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:25,601
and this crisis has befallen her now.

942
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:29,132
So how could I not waver?

943
01:06:30,141 --> 01:06:32,072
Will you betray Royal Noble Consort Eui...

944
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,712
as well as us?

945
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,482
I do not have any romantic
feelings for the Queen.

946
01:06:42,282 --> 01:06:44,221
She is simply not our enemy.

947
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:47,692
Hence, I am not betraying anyone.

948
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:50,121
You are growing fond of her,
which is dangerous.

949
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:52,398
If you are fond of her,

950
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,592
it will be used against us.

951
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:56,701
I will make sure that never happens.

952
01:06:57,561 --> 01:06:58,762
Fine.

953
01:06:59,871 --> 01:07:01,632
Then please promise me this one thing.

954
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:05,002
If the Queen's stance and attitude change,

955
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:08,672
or if she turns out to
be one of our enemies,

956
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:11,581
will you...

957
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:14,712
not hesitate...

958
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:19,222
to behead her?

959
01:07:44,682 --> 01:07:46,651
Can you not answer this question?

960
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:48,182
If the Queen...

961
01:07:50,052 --> 01:07:52,522
indeed turns out to be one of our enemies,

962
01:07:57,121 --> 01:08:00,491
I will behead her with my own two hands.

963
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:17,111
My gosh, looks like I'm
already getting better at this.

964
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:22,457
Did you seriously do that by hand?

965
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:24,627
When it comes to embroidery,
every woman in Joseon...

966
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:26,597
is as skilled as I am...

967
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:28,052
(Descendants of the Bright Land)

968
01:08:28,392 --> 01:08:29,422
Well, I guess not.

969
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:33,962
Not everyone has to
be skilled in embroidery.

970
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:37,637
You're good at everything
on top of being so strong.

971
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:40,731
I was considered a
weakling among the servants.

972
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:44,571
Everyone tells me
that I look like a violet.

973
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:49,441
My gosh, everyone in Joseon
is such a skilled craftsman.

974
01:08:50,111 --> 01:08:51,312
Let's see now.

975
01:08:52,941 --> 01:08:53,981
- Pull it. - Okay.

976
01:08:58,352 --> 01:09:01,022
(Descendants of the Bright
Land Inauguration Ceremony)

977
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,161
We'll put this up in front
of the Royal Stables.

978
01:09:04,562 --> 01:09:06,592
We'll begin operating
the business right away.

979
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:09,007
Shall we charge for delivery?

980
01:09:09,031 --> 01:09:11,031
I need some cash to go to Oktajeong.

981
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:12,361
Your Highness.

982
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:17,177
I brought you a wind orchid,
which is very rare.

983
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:18,302
Wind orchid?

984
01:09:19,871 --> 01:09:22,087
Did word get out about my
inauguration ceremony already?

985
01:09:22,111 --> 01:09:23,981
Who sent me this?

986
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:27,911
(Congratulations, No Touching)

987
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:31,481
It is from His Majesty.

988
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:37,491
My gosh, no!

989
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:39,908
That jerk.

990
01:09:39,932 --> 01:09:42,132
I'm trying to focus on work
to forget about everything.

991
01:09:42,531 --> 01:09:44,102
Is he showing off or what?

992
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,672
I'm a thousand times better.

993
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:50,217
I mean,
look at this. It's such a brilliant idea.

994
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,318
I'm creating jobs,
which the King can't even do.

995
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:55,182
During the Joseon period where the
notion of convenience doesn't exist.

996
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:57,382
I've invented this amazing service.

997
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:02,252
Does she feel intimidated
because I'm so amazing?

998
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:04,852
Well, that's understandable.

999
01:10:05,522 --> 01:10:06,722
Whatever.

1000
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:10,892
Did hearing all this obnoxious nonsense...

1001
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:15,531
ruin my palate? Why can
I not get the taste right?

1002
01:10:16,502 --> 01:10:17,802
Hold on.

1003
01:10:19,772 --> 01:10:22,252
Since the concept of convenience
doesn't even exist in Joseon,

1004
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:25,417
whatever I do will be
considered Joseon's first...

1005
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:28,241
No, the world's first!

1006
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,241
I feel so motivated all of a sudden.

1007
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:09,352
So here,
I can be Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs?

1008
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,222
No. Is there anyone who
achieved even greater things?

1009
01:11:13,491 --> 01:11:16,422
A hero who saved mankind.

1010
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:31,142
Inside the Queen's body,

1011
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:35,941
I see something that should not be there.

1012
01:11:37,142 --> 01:11:38,541
A wicked soul.

1013
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:44,581
She is possessed by a wicked soul!

1014
01:11:47,722 --> 01:11:49,991
You must do something about this.

1015
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:53,121
If not, the world...

1016
01:11:54,991 --> 01:12:00,132
The world will be thrown upside down!

1017
01:12:04,102 --> 01:12:05,142
Yes, Willis Carrier.

1018
01:12:05,802 --> 01:12:07,682
The man who invented
the first air conditioner.

1019
01:12:14,382 --> 01:12:15,387
Your Highness!

1020
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:17,828
Wake up, Your Highness! Please...

1021
01:12:17,852 --> 01:12:18,852
Your Highness!

1022
01:12:19,522 --> 01:12:21,121
Hey, move!

1023
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,031
She is... She is not breathing.

1024
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:38,302
I do not feel any pulse.

1025
01:12:53,592 --> 01:12:57,991
(Mr. Queen)

1026
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:15,917
The Queen is unconscious.

1027
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:17,887
You mean, she has stopped breathing?

1028
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:20,728
If her qi energy returns,
she will live. But if not...

1029
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:22,858
The hospital? Wait, am I back?

1030
01:13:22,882 --> 01:13:24,682
I will show you...

1031
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,592
what kind of man the King truly is.

1032
01:13:26,691 --> 01:13:30,922
The eyes of a man who
is hiding his true colors.

1033
01:13:31,022 --> 01:13:32,522
Clear. Shock!

1034
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:38,361
- My Queen.
- The investigation will begin now.

1035
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:39,602
Stop.

1036
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:41,632
She is my woman.

1037
