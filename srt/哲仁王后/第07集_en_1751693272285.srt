Really

8
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,660
Life is so empty.

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,530
Right?

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,550
Suddenly I am filled with the will to survive

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,980
Isn't she a maid in the Central Palace?

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,970
The one behind her is the imperial physician

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,660

What is this?

67
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,370
What are you doing?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Normal pulse

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,060
What about blood pressure?

70
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,620
Blood pressure is also normal

71
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,450
Hospital? Am I back?

72
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm back. I'm really back.

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,650
Zhang Fenghuan, you almost got into trouble.

74
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,770
I mean, I thought

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,770
To be trapped in a woman's body for the rest of your life

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,510
A lifetime is ruined.

77
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,920
What day is today?

78
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,090
That's right

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,310
I don't know how long I've been lying there.

80
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,910
My body feels heavy.

81
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,010
It's a week

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
The time is the same as in North Korea

83
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,020
Let me get up first.

84
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,660
I was unconscious for a week.

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,380
Can be considered a vegetable

86
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,200
What does vegetative state mean?

87
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,670
Hello, Dr. Li

88
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,640
Was it me you just talked about?

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,680
How can a healthy person be a vegetable?

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
What's the meaning

91
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,030
Keep watching

92
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,850
OK

93
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,650
Where to go back

94
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,580
I am fine

95
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
I am fine

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,940
What?

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,350
Can't anyone hear me?

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm back now

99
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,600
Jang Bong-hwan is back

100
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,480
When will the imperial physician arrive?

101
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,380
nave

102
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,090
Your Highness Your Highness

103
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,910
nave

104
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,470
Wake up, Central Palace

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,880
What is going on?

106
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,880
That that

107
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,170
Just woke up suddenly

108
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,230
Then he turned pale and fainted

109
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,940
It's impossible to faint like this for no reason

110
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,010
It's poison

111
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,250
She was poisoned.

112
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,310
What

113
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,490
Not Impossible

114
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,220
They pay great attention to food storage and prohibit random entry and exit.

115
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,350
The queen didn't eat anything here.

116
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,840
What is the nave doing here?

117
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,220
Are you cooking?

118
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,760
That's right

119
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,530
If so, have you tried any of them?

120
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,150
While tasting food

121
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,280
Just took the poison, His Highness

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,940
That's not sure.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,490
How come?

124
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,720
I've always been afraid of this happening.

125
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,360
Feeling uneasy

126
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
But

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,480
Still, this happened

128
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,500
How can poison be poison?

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,970
I

130
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,330
Let me take a look

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,610
Come on

132
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,400
this

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,660
Not a living person's pulse

134
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,830
What's the meaning

135
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,000
Corpse syncope

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,190
(The state of a vegetative person who has a pulse but no consciousness)
Corpse syncope

137
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,800
(The state of a vegetative person who has a pulse but no consciousness)

138
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,330
Corpse syncope?

139
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,970
The symptoms are like a corpse.

140
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,370
It's called corpse syncope

141
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,720
Qi and blood rising

142
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,450
I stopped breathing when I felt weak.

143
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,340
If I can recover my blood, I can survive.

144
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,790
If you can't come back

145
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm going to die

146
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,080
What to die

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,480
So

148
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,870
How to save

149
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,220
Put the restored soup and calamus juice into your mouth

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,960
Shangshan

151
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,970
Tell the pharmacy immediately

152
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,110
It's your highness

153
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,530
Can the Central Temple hold out until then?

154
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,040
That’s the key

155
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,900
Don't just say wait and do what you can do now

156
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,200
Please save our queen.

157
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,820
In this case

158
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,900
First, change the place

159
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,690
Go to the Dazao Temple

160
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,190
Niangniang

161
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,580
Concubine

162
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,930
The body of the nave must be

163
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,820
Drive that monster out

164
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,610
immediately

165
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,020
What can I do?

166
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,980
Planting unlucky things around the Daejoden

167
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,650
Blocking the aura

168
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,540
You need to use a magic trick to drive it out.

169
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,680
Danger

170
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,290
If there is a shaman dance in the palace

171
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,310
If you are discovered

172
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,800
If you're not in the palace, it's useless.

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,180
The shaman can only be performed in the area closest to the central temple.

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,970
Only effective

175
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,470
Hold on tight

176
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,880
OK

177
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,340
Is it over?

178
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,620
Yes, it's over.

179
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,110
What's going on?

180
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,060
The patient just developed heart failure

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,340
Hey, come here.

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,600
Can't you hear me?

183
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,720
What is he saying?

184
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, can you hear it?

185
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,200
That's it

186
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,690
I can see and hear everything

187
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,060
How could he be a vegetable?

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah

189
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,400
Did he really say anything?

190
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,720
He said he was very wronged

191
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,960
You stinky boy

192
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,290
Your fat ears should grow some flesh.

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,390
You should feel wronged, right?

194
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,810
With Director Han

195
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,590
Caught in the State Department's whale fight

196
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,160
I have to take the blame

197
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,950
What's the meaning

198
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,500
Is this all Director Han's doing?

199
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,340
Get treatment quickly.

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,280
Although I know he is stupid

201
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,800
But I don't think it's that stupid.

202
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,870
What can be done?

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,140
It can only be a one-sided beating.

204
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,680
It might be better for him to lie like this

205
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,500
Do you think this makes sense?

206
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,620
If it were you

207
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,520
Can you be bullied like a corpse like me?

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,700
Is this something a detective should say?

209
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,580
So

210
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,210
I'll take my life as a guarantee for the injection.

211
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,510
I can't forgive you

212
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,430
Director Han, you bastard

213
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,880
oops

214
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm gonna bite you to death

215
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,390
Cheoljong, why are you here?

216
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,320
oops

217
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,090
nave

218
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,170
MILF

219
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,460
Niangniang

220
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,470
I've been eating random things and taking poison.

221
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,740
What else do you want to eat?

222
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,010
Why

223
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,410
We have overcome the difficulties

224
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,170
Why can't you regain consciousness?

225
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,220
Although breathing has recovered

226
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,600
Not back to normal yet

227
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,590
There is a possibility of getting into dangerous situations

228
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,650
We have to keep observing

229
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,820
Why

230
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,240
You mean it's still dangerous?

231
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,640
Tonight

232
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,710
Very critical

233
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,160
The Lord went down to the Dazao Hall

234
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,270
What's wrong

235
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,450
The Queen Mother fainted

236
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,710
Said he would take care of her personally

237
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,000
knew

238
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,310
I need to change my clothes.

239
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,080
I said I know

240
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,680
Keep your mouth shut

241
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,650
If this matter is discovered

242
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,180
You can't escape the charge.

243
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,500
certainly

244
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,770
I see

245
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,670
That child was chosen as the most secret concubine

246
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,470
Just in time for use

247
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,340
It's really God's blessing.

248
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,250
Queen Dowager, are you in there?

249
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,650
Because there is an important prayer

250
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,790
I'm preparing.

251
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,450
It's nothing important. Please sit down.

252
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,210
I have something to tell you

253
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,270
I heard

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,860
I heard you told your father

255
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,650
Should I withdraw my comb?

256
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,960
Last time, the Queen Mother told me

257
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,820
I don't need to do it myself

258
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,200
That's it

259
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,460
Just in case

260
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,400
If I do it myself

261
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,470
If that's the case

262
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,570
Can you really defeat the Queen Mother?

263
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,510
I'll accompany her, you all go out.

264
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,070
I'm worried about hurting your body.

265
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,920
It doesn't matter

266
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,690
Shangshan, please go back.

267
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,350
OK

268
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,400
Since I came here

269
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,560
There is no comfortable day

270
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,990
Husband sleeping under the same roof

271
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,970
Want to kill me

272
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,380
If you feel your tongue is numb, take action immediately

273
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,210
Tell me to get out?

274
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,750
I mustered up the courage to apologize to you.

275
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,440
Is this all you can say?

276
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,980
Hello

277
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,710
The apology is up to the person who receives it.

278
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,260
If it is to make the person apologizing feel comfortable

279
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,450
Can that be called an apology?

280
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,580
Even if you understand me now, it's too late

281
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,350
You who always want to understand the key points

282
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,480
It won't be too late

283
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,290
This is the finest silk.

284
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,980
If you use this to make clothes

285
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,720
It's impossible not to remember

286
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,030
Are you sure?

287
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,510
Use satin artificial flowers to decorate the banquet

288
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,760
That's why I asked for silk tribute, right?

289
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,680
Yes

290
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,500
But if you want to make artificial flowers

291
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,080
That's too much.

292
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,670
that

293
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,160
It was Master Kim Moon-geun who took it.

294
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,410
This satin

295
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,600
Was it also taken away by Master Kim Moon-geun?

296
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh, this is

297
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,870
I always find it suspicious to see valuables being burned.

298
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,240
Pay close attention

299
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,600
This is it

300
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,350
Yongping Jun?

301
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,060
This can't be the master's instruction.

302
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,460
What

303
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,180
Concubine Zhao and Concubine Yi worked together

304
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,680
Are you dancing in the palace?

305
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,880
Yes

306
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,260
I heard that it was an unusual girl who became a concubine.

307
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,580
But she is the same kind of person as Concubine Zhao

308
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,110
very good

309
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,730
You can attack two stupid women at the same time

310
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,710
Although the shaman dance and the talisman and so on

311
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,450
Can make a lot of noise

312
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,360
But it's not something that can be fatal

313
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,440
That's right

314
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,490
If you can bring them

315
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,420
Lessons learned are enough

316
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,890
I am Shangshan and have an urgent matter to report.

317
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,970
Come in

318
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
What's up

319
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,840
The Queen Mother has stopped breathing.

320
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,140
Stop breathing?

321
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,410
Now, after the imperial physician's treatment, he has regained his breath.

322
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,790
But it still needs overnight care

323
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
What is going on?

324
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,160
Maybe it's in the imperial kitchen.

325
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,790
Poisoned

326
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,710
If you really want to fight her

327
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,670
I really want to defeat her.

328
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,730
Be kind to me in the future

329
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,080
Can't hide anything

330
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,380
Can you do it?

331
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,290
OK

332
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,490
I can do it

333
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,720
so

334
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,450
Lord

335
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,030
Is it the same as what we saw?

336
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,660
The current Lord

337
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,000
I have the same dream.

338
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,780
Are you breathing?

339
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,710
Is breathing

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,720
If I really fell asleep

341
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,280
The nave can't be so quiet

342
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,500
What's wrong

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,050
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

344
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,070
Mother

345
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,890
I always wanted a daughter

346
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,440
Are you happy now?

347
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,890
The sadder the time

348
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,650
The more I miss my mother

349
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,030
Get over it

350
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,450
Stand up optimistically and firmly, that's you

351
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,950
The promise of no touch

352
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,750
Always obey

353
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,630
Then why have you been speaking in such a weird tone?

354
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,360
And arrogant attitude

355
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,280
Everyone can forgive

356
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,640
Please wake up.

357
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,280
Fortunately, you are still in the palace

358
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,870
What can I do for you?

359
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,390
The Queen Mother died a while ago.

360
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,780
You mean she's not breathing?

361
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,290
Fortunately, I'm back now.

362
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,490
You immediately take the people from the Yijinfu to the former king's palace

363
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Is someone trying to harm the queen?

364
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,160
us

365
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,450
I think the Queen and Concubine Yi are the culprits.

366
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:16,190
(Spell)

367
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,330
What are you doing?

368
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,560
audacious in the extreme

369
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,660
Do you know where this is?

370
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,820
How dare you do such a brazen thing?

371
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,700
What about the Queen?

372
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,590
How dare you endanger the mother of a country?

373
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,540
What good end do you think will happen to you?

374
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,720
What can I do for you?

375
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,550
Get out of the way

376
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,010
Please don't do this

377
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,820
grown ups

378
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,360
I am just praying for peace in the court.

379
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,010
We are near the Dazao Temple

380
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,710
Found such a murderer

381
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,800
This matter has nothing to do with me

382
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,570
So this was committed by that guy alone?

383
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,810
It seems that your spirit has not

384
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,680
Tell you your life span

385
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,530
Today is your death anniversary

386
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,040
Save My Queen

387
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,970
I just followed your orders, madam.

388
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,290
Shut up!

389
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,050
Small

390
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,270
I can perform a ritual to remove the curse for you.

391
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,520
Perform a ritual to release the ritual

392
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,160
You don't believe in the country.

393
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,320
But a mere god

394
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,630
I think you don't take the palace seriously.

395
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,590
You misunderstood

396
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,230
Too late

397
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,650
The life of the middle temple is in danger.

398
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,840
How come?

399
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,810
The rituals performed

400
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,410
You yourself can't believe it

401
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,220
You actually believed such a liar

402
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,910
What is this all about?

403
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,330
The crime of destroying the prestige of the Nei Ming Fu

404
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,570
Attempt to harm the sanctum

405
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,040
The grave crime of destabilizing the country

406
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,580
So many crimes

407
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,510
How do you want to repay?

408
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,100
What is the current status of the Central Palace?

409
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,760
Are you still trying to pretend?

410
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,310
If so, I might as well tell you

411
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,870
Drinking Poison

412
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,100
The ingredients we take in the temple

413
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,610
Arsenic found

414
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,290
Arsenic

415
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,700
Aren't you familiar with Concubine Zhao?

416
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,930
Compared to concubines

417
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,780
The Queen Mother is more familiar with it.

418
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,910
You are still the same

419
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,150
In delusion, he blamed me for the death of the previous king.

420
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,150
No wonder people say humans are stupid

421
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,600
Anyway, I forgot the past in a blink of an eye

422
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,210
Even selling his own son's life to keep his position

423
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,390
I don't know how precious it is.

424
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,710
It was the Queen Mother who asked me first.

425
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,130
You have no interest in arsenic or the cause of the late king's death.

426
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,770
I just want you to live.

427
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,170
But what is this?

428
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,200
Drag the ignorant Yipin into the water

429
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
Curse and poison

430
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,190
Aren't you ashamed of the late king?

431
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,660
But also

432
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,060
If you have any sense of shame

433
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,000
I had already followed the previous king.

434
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,890
No matter how much I cry out for justice, it's useless.

435
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,100
You understand my grievances better than anyone else

436
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,450
If you still want to be stubborn, I can't help you

437
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,420
Someone come

438
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,080
This so-called Bodhisattva and Han Shanggong

439
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,680
All of them were executed by me at the end of the day.

440
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,800
yes

441
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
Please forgive me, Queen Dowager

442
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,310
Please forgive me, Queen Dowager

443
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,100
Niangniang

444
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,190
Then the Queen

445
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,140
please

446
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,040
Spare me

447
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,340
Please forgive me, Queen Dowager.

448
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,900
This is not you bowing your head and begging for mercy.

449
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,110
Things that can be tolerated

450
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,110
I want to pity you

451
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,170
How long will I tolerate you?

452
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,660
This time we really can't turn a blind eye

453
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,740
It's all my fault.

454
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,110
Please give me a chance to redeem myself.

455
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,740
Such a huge mistake

456
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,770
How can you redeem yourself?

457
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,790
The King and the Concubine

458
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,920
You must be confident

459
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,080
I have already taken control of the master.

460
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,870
You treated the previous king the same way.

461
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,030
Then she stopped ruling from behind the scenes.

462
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,200
Did you forget

463
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,800
Did Queen Jo's words concern you?

464
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,920
Let me confirm it for you.

465
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,640
What kind of person is the master?

466
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,360
What are you doing?

467
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,390
Niangniang

468
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,210
what are you up to

469
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,120
Please forgive me for taking the lady away

470
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,190
Take her away

471
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,280
Where are you taking her?

472
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,800
Sorry, I have no comment.

473
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,160
You can't tell me where the nave is.

474
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,950
What happened?

475
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,240
False appearance

476
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,710
The Former King's Palace was still holding a ceremony not long ago.

477
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,160
Cursing the Queen Mother

478
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,960
Queen Jo

479
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,710
And what Yipin did

480
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,900
Yipin would never do that.

481
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,740
and

482
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,730
Are you going to make a specious argument?

483
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,670
Is the nave like this because of a curse?

484
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,470
Arsenic was found in the imperial meal

485
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,390
Now the Uprising Forbidden Palace will begin searching

486
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
I want to ask you something related to this.

487
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,190
His Highness and Lord Yongping on the second night of their state wedding

488
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,190
Where to do what

489
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,820
What are you doing now?

490
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,500
Let me see your true face

491
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,780
It seems you don't remember

492
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,240
Then I can only formally interrogate Yongping Jun.

493
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,450
Stop it!

494
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,770
Your Highness

495
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,220
Please stop moving.

496
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,190
Lest your Highness's soldiers

497
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,120
Doing something disrespectful that would harm His Highness's body

498
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,720
Stop

499
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,450
This is the imperial order

500
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,960
She is a widow's woman

501
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,050
If you dare to touch the middle hall

502
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,580
My sword will chop off your head.

503
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,730
I didn't expect you to be so considerate of the Empress.

504
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,600
There are many things you don't know

505
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,390
But I can teach you one by one

506
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,410
Can you see the widow?

507
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,020
I am the king of a country

508
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,450
Whose soldiers are you?

509
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,870
It's the widow's

510
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,530
All of you should step back.

511
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,490
Your Highness

512
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,950
What a disloyal thing this is

513
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,670
Get out of here quickly

514
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,020
Unless you want to spill blood on the sacred temple

515
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,650
Yongping Jun, as long as it is His Highness's order

516
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,750
You don't mind even if your hands are covered in blood.

517
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,140
I have something to ask you.

518
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,570
You came just in time

519
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,720
I did not order this search.

520
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,260
The present-day Yijinfu

521
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,760
In whose name is the action being carried out?

522
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,970
I will confirm the case first.

523
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,030
So that no one will wrongly accuse good people again

524
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,930
The most innocent person is always the Queen Mother.

525
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,790
The little one told you

526
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,720
If you dare to make the queen unhappy

527
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,780
You can never be happy

528
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,400
Although the little one said that it was not a threat

529
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,060
But now I want to take that back.

530
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,150
presumptuous

531
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,660
That woman is no longer your cousin

532
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,790
Her safety is also natural.

533
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,280
Someone who can be responsible for her happiness and misfortune

534
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,720
You are no longer the deputy commander of the Imperial Guard.

535
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,850
But the widow

536
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,300
Take the nave to my home

537
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,480
Prepare for the Royal Ride

538
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,280
yes

539
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,360
Walk

540
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,920
I'm late.

541
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,220
All along

542
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,750
You managed to hide your true identity with great difficulty.

543
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,410
Pay attention to safety

544
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,710
yes

545
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,340
I'm sorry for letting you leave the palace alone.

546
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,740
Don't let your guard down until you arrive.

547
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,780
After arriving, we have to guard the main house for one night.

548
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,660
yes

549
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,090
Ouch

550
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,930
Except me

551
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,740
Everyone should rest comfortably.

552
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,470
What on earth do I want?

553
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,110
Still humming a song

554
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,480
Ouch

555
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,280
Back to the point

556
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,500
It's time for Jin Huan to come back.

557
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,420
Speak of the devil

558
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,080
I thought before I went to the training ground

559
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,460
I can't see you anymore.

560
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,050
Who

561
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,740
I met a good friend today

562
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,490
This is Li Shengpang

563
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,180
I met him when I was looking for Li Shengwang.

564
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,940
Just one word can bring such fate

565
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,550
Let's have a drink together

566
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,810
Let's gamble a little money

567
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,770
Is this some kind of wine curtain?

568
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,390
Still drinking and gambling, stop being funny

569
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,370
no

570
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,470
Aren't we always like this?

571
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,110
That's because of you.

572
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,330
It's not someone else but Jin Huan

573
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Because it's you

574
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,580
oops

575
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,270
Have you always been such a casual man?

576
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,670
Do you have so many friends and relationships?

577
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,250
I am just one of your common friends.

578
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,530
It is also one of the marriages that passed by.

579
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,390
so what

580
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,570
Did you drive Li Sheng Pang away?

581
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,050
Let you enter the palace immediately

582
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,230
What is the situation

583
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,920
Why is there no one?

584
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,360
Everybody left me behind

585
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,560
Did you go see what was going on?

586
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,970
Why do I feel so lonely lately?

587
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,210
Li Shengwang

588
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,740
So you are here

589
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,470
I finally found you

590
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,320
I recognized the wrong person

591
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,710
I thought he was my friend.

592
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,670
Excuse me

593
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,980
I don't understand what friends are.

594
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,900
But I do have some good stuff

595
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,950
This weird thing

596
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,760
What is

597
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,000
This is

598
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,310
The ban time has not yet passed

599
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,860
Why are you making so much noise?

600
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,700
Hide it quickly

601
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,030
Who are you

602
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,270
I got beaten so many times last time.

603
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,640
They're selling prostitution again.

604
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,370
What promiscuity?

605
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,540
This is the person

606
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,860
Want to sell it to me

607
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,520
You are guilty of rioting.

608
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,130
Immediately send them to the government office

609
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,700
yes

610
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,980
I

611
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,230
no

612
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,800
Please tap

613
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,760
hurry up

614
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,030
Tap

615
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,280
Be gentle

616
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,530
Go fast

617
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,270
He asked directly about the national wedding ceremony

618
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,840
The next night

619
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,360
In the end, it was the middle temple who told it.

620
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,740
I wonder why she didn't say anything.

621
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,080
If he knew I wanted to kill the middle temple

622
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,720
Never stop asking questions

623
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,460
He's on his first day in office.

624
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,620
They were disrespectful to me.

625
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,740
Saving the country in times of crisis

626
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,530
Authority enough to make the king afraid

627
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,900
Those unruly guys

628
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,220
It means they can

629
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,480
The threat of changing the king

630
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,240
If the opponent is really that fierce

631
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,200
Your Highness, please be patient.

632
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,330
If you do nothing

633
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,650
He will definitely investigate what happened that night.

634
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,390
So he set up a

635
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,540
The trap will reveal its true face

636
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,470
Yeah

637
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,120
He caught me by the tail.

638
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,830
Then I'll go investigate.

639
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,050
How much did he know?

640
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,040
First of all today

641
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,930
Let's pray that Nave wakes up unharmed.

642
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,800
Even for everyone

643
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,190
That's the most important

644
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,440
How to do transfer training?

645
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,370
Kim Byung-in is still watching.

646
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,670
The more this happens, the tougher it becomes.

647
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,730
That means we don't have much time.

648
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,010
Ouch

649
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,160
Oh, snapshot photo

650
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,370
Niangniang

651
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,270
Where is the queen?

652
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
On the way

653
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,930
Is the critical moment over?

654
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,960
Yes, it's fortunate.

655
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,830
Ouch

656
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,560
What a bolt from the blue

657
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,590
How did he get poisoned?

658
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,790
Who poisoned it?

659
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,600
I have called all the famous doctors in North Korea.

660
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Ouch

661
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,970
I have to be very alert.

662
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,310
calmly

663
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,970
Ouch

664
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,240
Oh my lady

665
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,800
Oh my lady

666
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,800
That's too cruel.

667
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,670
Who will poison the stigma?

668
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,450
Framed the Queen Mother

669
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,050
It's come to this

670
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,190
Huazhen, you'd better keep your distance from the Queen.

671
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,370
But I went to the Palace of the Former King

672
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,160
Still a topic of conversation

673
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,680
No need to blame yourself

674
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,060
No matter how well you guard yourself

675
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,380
They can pick out bones.

676
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:23,990
But

677
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,280
Why do you want the Queen to return to the mansion?

678
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,450
Maybe life in the palace was too lonely.

679
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,930
She called out to her mother in her sleep

680
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,560
That's the queen wanting to go home.

681
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,620
What's wrong

682
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,740
Any questions?

683
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,500
No

684
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,310
Don't worry too much

685
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,300
Once the situation is sorted out

686
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,860
I will let my brother tell you.

687
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,980
Your Highness

688
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,410
Please

689
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,560
Do you want to disobey the order?

690
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,220
Please don't get hurt

691
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,740
good

692
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,940
See you here

693
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,580
It's like time has gone backwards

694
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,420
Brother

695
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,850
You are the only one in the world who will look for me

696
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,620
I won't give up on you

697
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,750
I won't forget you

698
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,660
If only I could go back to that time

699
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,190
She is a widow's woman

700
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,130
You should be my talent.

701
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,900
I should be yours too

702
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,560
Do you know who I am?

703
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,150
I will soon

704
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,710
Kim Hwan, who wants to become an official of the Uiginbu

705
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,910
It's fine to advance the grain.

706
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,620
Do we need to advance even official positions now?

707
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,500
Who took the advance?

708
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,050
I am a very honest scholar.

709
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,920
I have such a dazzling appearance and talent

710
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,820
But still a Sungkyunkwan doctor

711
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,790
Don't you know yet?

712
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,050
I

713
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,750
I will never compromise with injustice

714
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Okay, that's enough noise.

715
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,810
Today, another noisy guy came in.

716
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,800
Really

717
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,430
As long as you let me out

718
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,010
I'll give you five taels of silver.

719
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,070
That five taels of money

720
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,280
Give it to me

721
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,980
I will give you a very valuable lesson

722
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,740
As long as you listen to me

723
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,960
Then you are no longer the same person you used to be.

724
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,700
Becoming a real adult

725
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,610
Are you going to enter the palace?

726
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,440
Well, you are here

727
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,070
I heard about what happened between you and the Lord yesterday.

728
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,090
yes

729
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,720
No matter how good a man is

730
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:48,620
I will also do something under the pressure of others.

731
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,170
Who made you do those useless things?

732
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,180
That is

733
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,630
That look

734
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,640
Trying to suppress emotions

735
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,020
The eyes of a man who hides his true face

736
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,860
I don't want to give it to the Queen Mother

737
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,370
Bring any trouble

738
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,570
I was overly worried.

739
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,010
Note

740
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,130
Father

741
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,570
The status of the Queen

742
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,530
Aren't you curious?

743
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,270
I heard that we are out of crisis.

744
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,410
Still hasn't regained consciousness

745
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,440
I should be able to overcome it quickly and wake up.

746
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,710
Anything else to say?

747
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,840
I heard that the Queen Mother

748
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,440
Mentioned the abdication of the Queen Mother

749
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,080
It's just a moment of anger, not sincere

750
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,080
You're worrying for no reason.

751
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,850
I know how much you care about the Central Palace

752
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,280
Although not as good as you

753
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,450
I'm worried too, don't worry

754
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,710
OK

755
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,800
See you in the palace

756
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,760
The father-in-law sent so many gifts again

757
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,820
How's the Central Temple?

758
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,640
First of all, we have overcome the difficulties

759
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,040
Because he needed to recuperate, he was transferred to his family.

760
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,290
There are constant problems.

761
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,170
Not fully recovered after the accident

762
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,380
How to say it

763
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,680
Should I say it's a malfunction?

764
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,680
Although I have made do with it and used it again after repairing it

765
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,200
Suddenly I became so weak

766
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,680
If the concubine gives birth to a prince first,

767
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,020
Will Concubine Zhao be unbridled again?

768
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,200
Don't worry

769
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,750
I have a backup plan ready

770
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,680
Alternative plan?

771
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,460
Two candidates selected as the third selection

772
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,810
It has made it impossible for them to get married.

773
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,560
He is indeed a reliable brother.

774
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,680
Yesterday, Bingren

775
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,710
Forced the Lord

776
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,700
Yesterday everyone thought that there was something wrong with the Lord.

777
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,480
Just like the Lord is different from what he sees

778
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,750
What else

779
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,640
The Lord is different from the previous king.

780
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,430
I don't care whose eyes it is.

781
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,480
I let the Lord sit

782
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,720
There is only one reason for that position.

783
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,360
In order not to let my sister

784
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,500
Going through the same painful choice as the previous king

785
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,020
Yes indeed.

786
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,390
It's really painful

787
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,130
This is my hand

788
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,700
The country I protect with my grandson's blood

789
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,390
So if anyone wants to destroy

790
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,910
is even more unforgivable

791
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,560
You eat first

792
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,930
Brother, you eat first.

793
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,220
Where is this

794
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,620
North Korea?

795
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,310
Hell Korea?

796
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,120
Is it North Korea?

797
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,050
I'm lucky I didn't have that to make me sad

798
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,930
It's unfortunate that I can move and confirm it, but it makes me happy

799
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,650
But this place is so dazzling

800
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,120
El Dorado

801
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,840
Inca?

802
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,650
Niangniang

803
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,740
I thought I had traveled through time.

804
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,320
A more distant era is startled

805
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,980
You finally woke up

806
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,590
It's not a sense of déjà vu

807
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,350
Don't repeat it again

808
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,980
But it almost happened.

809
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,200
Completely stopped breathing

810
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,430
Stop, stop, stop

811
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,810
Stop breathing?

812
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,560
According to the imperial physician, it was cadaveric syncope.

813
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,490
Symptoms like a corpse

814
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,700
I am also a vegetable here.

815
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,960
But where is this place?

816
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,250
The Empress's family

817
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,770
This shows

818
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,710
The encounter I really want to avoid

819
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,700
I can't hide anymore.

820
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:58,910
What

821
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,630
Although nothing is difficult for me

822
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,880
There is only one difficult existence

823
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,280
Just like a natural enemy,

824
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,050
The father of women

825
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,570
Niangniang

826
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,330
Oh my god

827
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,640
Oh my god

828
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,990
Are you okay?

829
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,650
Can you breathe?

830
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,240
What do you need? Should I call the imperial physician?

831
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,690
It's not me, it's you who's going to die.

832
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,780
First come come

833
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,440
Drink it all the way

834
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,630
OK OK

835
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,660
This is a decoction to replenish a woman's yin energy.

836
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,720
That's right.

837
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,580
Why are you sweating all the time?

838
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,050
You don't know how worried I am

839
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,720
Didn't sleep all night.

840
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:46,950
Dry mouth

841
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,580
I can't eat anything since yesterday.

842
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,860
If you sit down and stand up again

843
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,920
Darkness before my eyes

844
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,000
Looks like he got a big shock.

845
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,200
The root of all diseases is sorrow and worry.

846
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,090
So take a good rest

847
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,930
Calm your mind

848
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,030
Good good good

849
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,910
I will do this

850
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,330
I wish you a speedy recovery

851
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,710
Then I first

852
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,270
Niangniang

853
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,430
where are you going

854
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,610
It shouldn't be like this

855
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,270
Etiquette should be observed

856
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:16,810
Whatever you do, it's embarrassing.

857
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,020
This is even more embarrassing.

858
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,190
No, no.

859
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,230
Please accept my greeting, my lady.

860
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,510
don't want

861
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,770
No, no.

862
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,530
Salute you again

863
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,070
Father

864
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,070
In North Korea, everyone treats me like a queen.

865
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,850
Even here please

866
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,770
Just my father's daughter

867
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,780
Let me be Zhaorong.

868
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,890
The more prestigious the position

869
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,480
The more lonely

870
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,960
OK OK

871
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,290
At least during the time here

872
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,580
In order for you to spend a comfortable time

873
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,450
I will treat you the same as before

874
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,840
Okay, sit down.

875
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,190
yes

876
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:05,850
Thank you

877
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,380
No matter how you clean up

878
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,300
The room is dark.

879
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,800
Zhaorong, you are back

880
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,080
Now it starts to shine

881
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,250
yes

882
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,520
It's so bright that it's blinding.

883
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,330
I also like

884
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,380
In order not to lose to someone in the famous city

885
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,630
I put some thought into it

886
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,260
Everything else is ready.

887
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,640
Like always

888
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,660
Use the best

889
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,680
Come in next person.

890
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,510
The famous doctor who is nowhere to be seen over there

891
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,230
Are there so many?

892
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,050
Is anyone else coming?

893
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,930
Where's the wedding banquet?

894
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,300
This is the breakfast table.

895
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,610
To restore the queen's energy

896
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,010
The adults prepared turtle soup

897
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,160
Come

898
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,320
Please use

899
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,840
Do you fall asleep as soon as you open your eyes?
(Note: "龟" and "睡" have the same pronunciation in Korean)

900
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,170
What's wrong? What's what?

901
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,880
It's an honor to serve you, my lady.

902
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,600
This is North Korea's most powerful visiting beautician

903
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,600
I am a natural beauty, I don't need to dress up.

904
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,630
Please come over

905
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,090
The abdication petition and poisoning

906
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,770
How could he harm our queen so much?

907
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,300
Don't worry

908
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,910
The forces that harm the empress are getting more rampant.

909
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,770
I will also expand my power

910
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,570
There is such a cousin

911
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,830
How down-to-earth our queen should be

912
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,100
Do you still remember this item?

913
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,180
Satin is just satin

914
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,540
Is there anything special about this?

915
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,140
Clothes made through this

916
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,950
Have you given any gifts to anyone?

917
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,320
After the Queen became the Queen

918
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,220
Only received gifts

919
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,620
Because there is nothing sent out

920
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,350
The gifts I gave

921
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,780
This is all for the Queen Mother.

922
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,570
I see

923
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,810
But maybe

924
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,740
The warehouse was robbed twice recently.

925
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,260
Maybe there is this silk in it

926
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,620
Are you saying that the private residence was attacked?

927
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,210
No, no

928
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,390
The so-called property

929
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,080
Because it's dangerous to keep it in one place

930
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,570
You have to keep them separately here and there.

931
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,410
I have several warehouses.

932
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,530
But

933
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,700
Only the secret warehouses that hide the most valuable items were selected.

934
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,900
Recall this matter

935
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,320
The back of the neck hurts

936
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,340
My precious babies

937
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,760
The missing property

938
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,600
Is there a way to confirm whether there is such silk?

939
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,720
There were a lot of items originally

940
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,040
Dealing with stolen goods openly is also quite dangerous

941
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,060
So,

942
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,130
Don't mention the warehouse.

943
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,490
Wouldn't it be appropriate if people knew about this?

944
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,700
I see

945
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,140
But have you

946
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,090
Hearing strange words from my father

947
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,840
What can I do for you?

948
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,810
Last time, my lady

949
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,760
Because I saved His Highness and Concubine Yi.

950
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,450
I'm really worried about being disliked by the Queen Mother

951
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,650
And I always have nightmares about the Queen being deposed.

952
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,470
What waste position

953
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,980
Why do you think so?

954
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,840
Among the candidate families who failed to be selected

955
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,000
I heard there are mysterious rumors

956
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,720
I wonder if they are considering a new nave.

957
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,700
I've been worried about this lately.

958
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,740
All overeating

959
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,500
They are not the kind of people who would abandon the Queen

960
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,270
Right

961
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,880
I

962
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,870
Will work harder

963
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,460
Choosing a Gift for the Queen Mother

964
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,900
How's your health?

965
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,330
This little thing will happen immediately

966
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,380
It seems that it won't be healed right away.

967
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,720
How could such an accident happen?

968
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,050
I

969
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,500
Forgot your age

970
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,900
Alone and careless

971
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,630
I now

972
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,130
This isn't the time to laugh.

973
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,780
How are you feeling?

974
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,550
I feel like I'm a Barbie doll.

975
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,650
Very good

976
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,040
It means happy, right?

977
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,380
This damp smell of books

978
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,570
No wonder it smells like a student

979
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,980
If the lady were a man

980
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,640
She will definitely enter the palace through the imperial examination.

981
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,920
After all, I really like reading and studying.

982
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,190
Who likes to learn?

983
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,590
I just want to make my dad happy.

984
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,690
Born at the cost of my mother's death

985
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,180
I think it's worth it.

986
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,440
So every time my birthday comes, I have a nosebleed and can't sleep

987
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,860
Just reading books

988
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,820
Zhao Rong

989
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,120
Happy birthday

990
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,740
My birthday is my mother's death anniversary

991
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,780
So I've been in a bad mood

992
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,950
Just this idea

993
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:12,940
The Queen finally recovered her memory

994
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:15,940
What's this

995
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,060

Everyone in the palace has secrets.

1023

Secrets disguised as lies
