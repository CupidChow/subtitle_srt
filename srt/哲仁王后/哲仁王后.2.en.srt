1
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:06,839
"This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations,"

2
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,110
"and events are unrelated
to historical events."

3
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,250
No, I didn't mean that!

4
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,730
I can't help but take the last step.

5
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:39,409
He's fast.

6
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,839
What is it? I should
ask you the same thing.

7
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,808
I thought the moonlight was enough
to set the mood while having drinks,

8
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,210
so I blew out the candle.

9
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:53,350
I was going to clear my throat
before we started drinking for real.

10
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,820
You can consider it a warm-up.

11
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,719
Like this.

12
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,930
What are you doing? Darn it.

13
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,799
Did you not want to warm-up
each other's vocal cords?

14
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,929
What a cunning jerk. Did
he do that on purpose?

15
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:11,439
No, there's no way.

16
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,808
Now that we've warmed up our throats,

17
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:16,733
you should start drinking
in earnest, My Queen.

18
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:19,780
Gosh.

19
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:22,079
It's no fun to drink alone.

20
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:25,790
I did not think about that.

21
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,219
Here.

22
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:37,599
Thanks to the warm-up exercises,

23
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,629
the drink goes down very smoothly.

24
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,700
What? What was I doing until now?

25
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:47,439
Here. Drink up.

26
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,209
You should also drink too, My Queen.

27
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,250
The king must drink first.

28
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,450
The queen must drink first.

29
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,950
He has changed his strategy.

30
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:02,189
I know what's inside
that dark soul of yours.

31
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:06,858
Then how about we each have a drink...

32
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:09,329
and go to bed since it
has been a long day?

33
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,829
What are you saying?
We're just getting started.

34
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,969
Don't be like that.

35
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,640
Here we go. Be manly and
lovely and drink it all in one shot.

36
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,170
One shot.

37
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,608
I am a light sleeper,

38
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,179
so keep your distance while we sleep.

39
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,950
What kind of game is he
playing at with that nonsense?

40
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,130
"Win During the Day and Fade At Night"

41
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:51,151
The truth behind the king, known
for his love of alcohol and women...

42
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,042
The Annals of the Joseon
Dynasty are nothing but tabloids.

43
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:57,739
I was scared for no reason.

44
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:00,779
However, I shouldn't put my guard down.

45
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,789
I'm finally putting to use...

46
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,720
the granny knot I learned in the Army.

47
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,459
If he wants to take it off,
he will have to cut it off.

48
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:13,690
Okay.

49
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,728
That selfish king.

50
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,700
He's sleeping alone on the soft bedding.

51
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,279
Goodness, My Queen.

52
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,049
I know how you feel,

53
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,489
but I would just like to sleep tonight.

54
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:42,988
It's not like that. I
was raised with care,

55
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:44,920
so I can't sleep on the bare floor.

56
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:46,630
Give me one of these.

57
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:48,828
I cannot sleep...

58
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,130
if I have less than
three layers of bedding.

59
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,631
I am sure you were not raised
with more care than a king.

60
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:01,569
He's trying to distort history.

61
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,902
He's nothing but the Woodcutter
Prince of Ganghwa Island.

62
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:22,699
Gosh.

63
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,400
I hope he gets sleep paralysis.

64
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:35,309
Since things turned out this
way, I'll be on night watch.

65
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:40,009
I'm reminded of the Army in
more aspects than one tonight.

66
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:57,360
"Episode 2: Nobody Knows"

67
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:57,518
Are you awake, Your Highness?

68
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,160
Darn it.

69
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,230
I was hoping I wasn't,
but I guess I'm still here.

70
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,030
What does it feel like to
greet the first day as Queen?

71
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,069
It feels like poop.

72
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,170
Oh, my.

73
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,239
My granny knot.

74
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,080
Did you lose something again?

75
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,590
I will search high and low... No!

76
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,790
I'm sure I untied it in my sleep
because I felt uncomfortable. Right?

77
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,170
Your Majesty.

78
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:21,770
When did you arrive at Huijeongjeon Hall?

79
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,610
I apologize for not escorting you.

80
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:28,879
I did not want to wake the
Queen, so I left the room quietly.

81
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:32,319
Did you have a nightmare again?

82
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:37,189
The Queen must not
lose sleep because of me.

83
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,360
It is her first day as queen.

84
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:44,059
I will serve you Arabian jasmine
tea tonight so that you can sleep well.

85
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:51,639
The Queen must be greeting
the ladies of the court right now.

86
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,410
I heard they just left.

87
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,280
I am curious to see how the
Queen appears from now on.

88
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:06,220
I get that yesterday was the wedding,

89
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:08,989
but why am I busy as
soon as I woke up today?

90
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,059
You have the johyeonrye
where you must go and greet...

91
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,230
the Grand Queen Dowager
and the Queen Dowager,

92
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,559
and the celebration ceremony where
the royal court officials greet you.

93
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,859
After you complete the
official wedding ceremonies...

94
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,730
Is that when the royal marriage ends?

95
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:24,038
No. His Majesty must proclaim
the message to announce...

96
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,340
your investiture as the queen.

97
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:30,080
It's a never-ending wedding.

98
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:34,209
Hold on. The Grand Queen Dowager is...

99
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:37,379
Grand Queen Dowager ordered it.

100
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:40,889
If I fill the lake with water, it
means I will be crossing her.

101
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,389
What kind of person is
the Grand Queen Dowager?

102
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,190
The Grand Queen Dowager...

103
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,100
is an elder who is also from the
Andong Kim clan, just like you,

104
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:55,570
and the Queen Dowager is
from the Pungyang Jo clan.

105
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,109
So my mother-in-law and
grandmother-in-law are rivals.

106
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,879
And I, the queen, is in the same
line as my grandmother-in-law.

107
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,079
I'm sure I'll be able to
tell when I see them, right?

108
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,494
The person who looks older
will be the Grand Queen Dowager.

109
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,519
What else?

110
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,850
This is really important to me, so
tell me everything you know. Okay?

111
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,959
She is Lord Kim Jwa Geun sister,

112
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,788
and she has never set foot outside
of the palace once she entered it.

113
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,159
Also... Stop.

114
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,970
No, the palanquin. Stop!

115
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,269
Stop! Stop.

116
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:37,980
Go back.

117
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,980
Go in reverse.

118
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:43,119
Go in reverse.

119
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:49,720
That is enough.

120
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:59,499
Something more important just came up.

121
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:36,570
Did you lose your way because
the palace is complicated?

122
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,940
It's nice to meet you. What's your name?

123
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:49,749
Goodness.

124
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,119
I'm not used to this body yet.

125
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,090
Your luxurious aura is uncommon.

126
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:01,959
Are you a part of the royal family too?

127
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:05,200
Are you a princess or something?

128
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,800
I apologize.

129
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:11,139
If my behaviour was
arrogant and bothered you,

130
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:12,639
please forgive me, Your Highness.

131
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:15,839
No. What I'm trying to say is...

132
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:16,940
Your Highness.

133
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,909
You walk so fast. How
did you get here already?

134
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:22,210
Hello.

135
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:25,850
Do you know her?

136
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,589
She is Lady Hwa Jin of the Jo clan...

137
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,590
who is becoming the
king's royal concubine.

138
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,629
I understand that she is the Queen,

139
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,259
but is she not insulting you too much?

140
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:37,798
She keeps twisting her words.

141
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,999
There are rumours within
the palace that she is the one...

142
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,599
who pushed you into the lake.

143
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,840
I am certain that the rumours that
the Queen lost her memory are false.

144
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:47,019
You must be careful. You must be careful.

145
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:59,449
I have spent a lot of
time with many women,

146
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:01,700
so I am able to tell a lot by
seeing their physiognomy.

147
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,889
You are... How should I put it?

148
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,529
You're a good person.

149
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,970
I guess you and her don't have
a good history with each other,

150
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,769
but shall we start again?

151
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,700
I like you.

152
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,869
Let's be friends.

153
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,649
Did you decide to change your strategy?

154
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:29,950
My strategy?

155
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:33,820
I found out what kind of
place this is thanks to you.

156
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,759
The reality that I have entered
the palace has finally sunk in.

157
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:40,888
No. It seems you have
misunderstood what I am saying.

158
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,999
I... I am sorry, but I must go.

159
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,369
Your Majesty.

160
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:49,899
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

161
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:53,408
I went to the royal villa,
but you were not there.

162
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:56,308
I also went to greet you,
but you were not there.

163
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,879
Oh, my. We must have crossed paths.

164
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,249
We were thinking the same thing.

165
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,950
If she's the royal concubine, then
she's Cheoljong's second wife?

166
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,089
I shouldn't have gone into this body.

167
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,860
I should've gone into that one.

168
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:16,259
I am trembling in fear over the
jealousy in Her Highness' eyes.

169
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,899
Why don't you get a room?

170
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:25,899
My Queen.

171
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,739
I would like you to rush the
investiture of the Royal Concubine.

172
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,709
That's too bad.

173
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,648
I'm too busy to take care of the
investiture of the Royal Concubine.

174
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:39,019
It is a royal command.

175
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:43,119
I hope polygamy gets ruined.

176
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,730
Your Highness.

177
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:50,060
The ladies of the court
are waiting for you...

178
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,060
Your Majesty.

179
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,669
I have an important meeting. Bye.

180
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,279
What on earth...

181
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,009
Your Highness.

182
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:14,050
That must have scared you.

183
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,590
Hwa Jin.

184
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,989
I will finally be able
to call you my wife.

185
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,460
Now, I will be living
in the palace with you.

186
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:28,200
You deserve a proper wedding.

187
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:31,899
But actually, a eunuch
saw you in front of the lake.

188
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,710
They are trying to frame you
for what happened at the lake.

189
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:37,980
So I had to rush the selection process.

190
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:41,278
I only went there as I
was surprised to hear...

191
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,749
a loud noise at the lake.

192
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,649
Do not worry.

193
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,619
She will not be able to harm you...

194
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,419
even if she is from the Andong Kim clan.

195
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,700
No. I will make sure that
she does nothing about this.

196
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,769
I will protect you
with everything I have.

197
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:04,869
Your Majesty.

198
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:08,470
By the way, it seems to me
I do not have much to offer.

199
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,138
I am only a puppet on the throne.

200
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,185
And I have an older
brother who is a worry wart...

201
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,279
and a friend who likes to have fun.

202
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:16,649
And I have...

203
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:19,820
a beautiful woman.

204
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:27,389
You are a rich man.

205
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:33,268
I vouched for your
whereabouts of that night.

206
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,600
Do not worry.

207
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:51,079
What? Which one is the
Grand Queen Dowager?

208
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,190
Offer your greetings, Your Highness.

209
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,489
Darn it. Whatever.

210
00:16:56,294 --> 00:17:00,989
I hope your night was
peaceful, Grand Queen Dowager.

211
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:12,038
You have gotten so young over the night.

212
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,609
It seemed you have regained your youth.

213
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,440
It almost fooled me that you
were the Queen Dowager.

214
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,310
That wench.

215
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,680
Is that so?

216
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,649
All my hard work paid off.

217
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,720
Great. That was smooth.

218
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,850
You were in such a tragic accident.

219
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,989
My gosh. It seems to me that
you have not made a full recovery.

220
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,259
Can you not tell?

221
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,199
That is how the perfect
queen ought to look.

222
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,970
She is sharp like before.

223
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,369
I see.

224
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,169
Gosh, yes. You are right.

225
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:51,039
They're getting on each other's
nerves while smiling at each other.

226
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:52,940
I should stay on my toes.

227
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:56,720
Now, all that remains is
your effort to produce an heir.

228
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:01,388
I have learned about this secret
tip on getting blessed with a prince...

229
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,820
which has been passed down
over generations at the palace.

230
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:07,260
Is that so?

231
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:11,429
This is what you do when you
are spending the night with the king,

232
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:13,729
When he is lying down on his back,

233
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:14,869
you can...

234
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,419
She's by far the worst in-law ever.

235
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,818
And at this very critical
moment, you can...

236
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,389
Mother, I will take care of that myself.

237
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:51,139
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

238
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:55,540
Well, I am
well-knowledgeable in that area.

239
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,520
Right.

240
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:10,560
You took a lot of bridal
lessons to be a good wife to him.

241
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:13,360
I am sure you are well-prepared for it.

242
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:15,689
I see.

243
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:19,860
I must have overstepped.

244
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:25,169
You don't like it when your
daughter-in-law is unsophisticated.

245
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,570
But it's nice to see when
your granddaughter-in-law is.

246
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,058
My gosh.

247
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,629
These are so long. What a
creative way to kill someone.

248
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,399
My neck hurts.

249
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:54,000
You seem very tired.

250
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:55,568
Right.

251
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,869
We did drink a bit too much last night.

252
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,639
That was nothing.

253
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,969
The court officials
must be waiting for us.

254
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,479
Let us go in.

255
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,290
"Injeongjeon Hall"

256
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:52,060
Chief State Councillor Kim Byung Hak.

257
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,560
Congratulations.

258
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:06,038
Left State Councillor Kim Seok Geun.

259
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:07,610
Congratulations.

260
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:12,080
Minister of War Kim Chang Hyuk.

261
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:13,848
Congratulations.

262
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,580
They are all Kims.

263
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,350
So these are the famous
trio of the Andong Kim clan.

264
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,818
With the help of the Grand
Queen Dowager and the Queen,

265
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,989
they collected taxes
under all kinds of excuses...

266
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,791
which caused the people
to have a hard time.

267
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,899
In today's world, it's
equivalent to military corruption,

268
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,798
real estate corruption,
and tax evasion corruption.

269
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:34,628
They were corrupt in every way possible.

270
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,268
In other words, they
were the corrupt trio,

271
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:38,798
the symbol of corrupt politicians
that ruined the Joseon Dynasty.

272
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,310
The Andong Kim clan.

273
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:45,740
Right State Councillor Jo Man Hong.

274
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,780
Congratulations.

275
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,189
Minister of Personnel Jo Deok Moon.

276
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,490
Congratulations.

277
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:00,889
I see. The Pungyang Jo clan.

278
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:04,007
This clan that centered around
the Queen Dowager is famous too.

279
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,659
When the son of the Queen
Dowager, Heonjong, was the king,

280
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,669
they reaped the benefits. And
when Heonjong passed away,

281
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:09,699
Kim So Yong of the Andong
Kim clan became the queen,

282
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,100
they lost all of their power.

283
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,770
There are more than just these minnows.

284
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,479
The big names in this era.

285
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:20,909
Training Commander Kim Jwa Geun.

286
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,820
Congratulations, Your Majesty...

287
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,820
and Your Highness.

288
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,350
The real power behind the Kim clan.

289
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,989
I would like to report one
thing as we celebrate...

290
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,129
the royal wedding.

291
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,459
What is it?

292
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,000
The Royal Guard Commander
looks after your safety.

293
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:46,169
I would like to recommend your
father-in-law, Kim Mun Geun.

294
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,909
My father-in-law?

295
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:51,540
Yes.

296
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:56,750
It is an important appointment.

297
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,419
It was out of Her Highness'
concerns about your safety.

298
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:03,389
I apologize for not
bringing this up sooner.

299
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,860
Is that your request?

300
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,659
I have no idea. But...

301
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,659
I want to be on the winner's side.

302
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,770
All I care about, alive
or dead, is your safety.

303
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:18,770
To ensure your safety, I
even stayed up all night.

304
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:23,070
Oh, no. What a sly woman.

305
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:29,379
I see. I will consider it.

306
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:30,919
The Grand Queen Dowager...

307
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:33,919
was very satisfied with
Her Highness' request.

308
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,518
Currently, my older brother,
Prince Yeongpyeong,

309
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:37,889
holds the position.

310
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:39,889
Give me some time to consider it.

311
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:42,629
Your safety is the most
important matter at hand.

312
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:48,000
Please understand that we would
like to expedite the appointment.

313
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,439
Your Majesty.

314
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:13,090
Your love for me is endless.

315
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:17,530
Then, I will proceed
with it with your approval.

316
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:22,169
Kim Jwa Geun,

317
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:24,369
who is powerful beyond the king.

318
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:28,139
He's the real boss of the court.

319
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:33,310
I totally need some popcorn for this.

320
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,149
Your Highness. Your Highness.

321
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:59,699
Sorry about that. Please continue.

322
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:06,580
My Queen seems tired. How about
we wrap up the ceremony here?

323
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:10,619
Spending the night together is
a divine act to conceive an heir.

324
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:13,179
It should never be for your own pleasure.

325
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:16,090
However, I lost my prudence last night.

326
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:20,189
A loving, happy marriage is
nothing to be frowned upon.

327
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:21,490
Is that so?

328
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:23,189
What's this guy talking about?

329
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:26,159
Then we shall end the ceremony here.

330
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:31,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

331
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:37,280
You were just bluffing, right?

332
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,439
What do you mean?

333
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:41,878
Nothing happened last night.

334
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:45,350
This makes me sad. I
understand you drank,

335
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,320
but how could you forget what
happened on our wedding night?

336
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:50,959
What are you saying?

337
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,260
However, I do understand.

338
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:55,629
You recently suffered from
amnesia, so that could be why.

339
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:59,229
Impossible. There's no way that happened.

340
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,899
You passed the test.

341
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,969
"Test"? What test?

342
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:10,240
The virginity test to make sure
you bleed on your marital bed.

343
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:13,409
Anyhow, I have other matters to tend to.

344
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:20,989
Hey, wait. Can we
finish this conversation?

345
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:24,119
Your Highness, let us take
you back to your chamber.

346
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:29,330
Don't worry, Jang Bong
Hwan. He's obviously lying.

347
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:32,729
Hey, think about it. You'd
know if it actually happened.

348
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,800
There's no way that happened.

349
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:40,369
Of course, he doesn't want people
to know that he lacks stamina.

350
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,969
And it seems that he has
a habit of distorting history.

351
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,239
Still, must he be so calculating?

352
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,450
And what's with that test
thing? He even made that up?

353
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:51,520
Stop for a second.

354
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,119
Can I ask you something?

355
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:01,760
Is it possible for women
to not know after doing it?

356
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:03,129
"It"?

357
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:05,699
What exactly are you
referring to, Your Highness?

358
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:09,669
She's obviously too young.

359
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,736
And this court lady must be
even more celibate than monks are.

360
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:18,209
I don't think anyone here
can answer my question.

361
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,110
Oh, my goodness!

362
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:40,768
Is that kid crying because of
me? Of course not, Your Highness.

363
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,969
The wind is cold. Let me
close the window for you.

364
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,139
What? I'm sweating
right now. It is very cold.

365
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:46,368
It's hot in here! You will catch a cold.

366
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,868
I feel hot right now!

367
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,070
Let us go.

368
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:55,610
What that punk, Cheoljong
said keeps bothering me.

369
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,563
It is safe for you to eat, Your Highness.

370
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,834
Now that I have seen the Queen,

371
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,902
I am certain that
something is wrong with her.

372
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,174
How should I put this?

373
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,144
Shall I say she is too brazen?

374
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,112
She did have a bold side to her,

375
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,343
but she was never that
blindly brazen and fearless.

376
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,682
She lost her poise even
during the ceremony.

377
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,223
I must teach her to behave herself.

378
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,223
There is no need for us to give
the others something to prey on.

379
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,993
About Jo Hwa Jin...

380
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,594
Are you sure she was
with His Majesty that night?

381
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:44,803
Yes, I verified everything.

382
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:47,833
She entered the palace
about 15 minutes...

383
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,604
after the accident took place.

384
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,844
It cannot serve as proof that she
did not try to harm Her Majesty,

385
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,414
but they will try to use it as evidence.

386
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,914
It is a mystery.

387
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:02,053
If it was not her, who did such a thing?

388
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,084
Do you think that
someone else is involved?

389
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,694
Perhaps.

390
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:11,463
However, it does not matter who did it.

391
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:16,733
Who do we need it to
be? That is more important.

392
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,233
Who do we need it to be?

393
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,573
If we point to a deer...

394
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:25,374
and say that it is a horse,
then it shall be a horse.

395
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,713
And in our case, that deer may
truly become a horse down the road.

396
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:34,353
All right. Forget about such
political affairs for a moment...

397
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,283
and have some food, Your Highness.

398
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:40,952
Since you are making
sure that I always eat well,

399
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:44,362
I have no choice but to take
excellent care of my health.

400
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,063
I will never let anyone or
anything harm your health.

401
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,463
Have some food.

402
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:07,412
"I hereby give the senior
first-rank in the Internal Court..."

403
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:08,912
"to Jo Hwa Jin, the daughter..."

404
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:11,854
"of Royal Secretariat Jo Dae
Su from the Pungyang Jo clan."

405
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:15,452
"She is also given the title
of Royal Noble Consort Eui..."

406
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,823
"because of her beauty
and righteousness..."

407
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,563
The Pungyang Jo clan.

408
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,862
Their families are
rivals, and so are they.

409
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:24,533
Did she really push Kim
So Yong into the lake?

410
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:26,864
She's dangerous,

411
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:28,834
so I find her intriguing.

412
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,674
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

413
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:37,414
Let's get along.

414
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,053
I should take the winner's side,

415
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,553
but I can't keep my guard
up in front of such beauty.

416
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,954
Let's get along.

417
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,223
You'll find out soon, but I'm
perfect, except for the fact...

418
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:54,993
that I have many flaws.

419
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,303
Well, since we're family now,

420
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,033
can I ask you something?

421
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,043
I have no one else to ask.

422
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:07,712
Since I am not wise enough, I am
not sure if I can answer your question.

423
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:11,013
Oh, it's about something
you know very well. The King.

424
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,963
Does he tend to bluff a lot?

425
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,634
I heard girls talk
about all sorts of stuff.

426
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,003
And that being said, the King...

427
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:36,404
tends to fade at night.

428
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,374
"Tends to fade at night"?

429
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,273
I have never heard such
an expression before.

430
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,444
He wins during the
day but fades at night.

431
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:50,353
But he talked as if we had
a steamy night together.

432
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,323
He has a tendency to
distort... Your Highness.

433
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:56,454
With all due respect, I find
this highly inappropriate.

434
00:31:56,728 --> 00:32:00,364
Oh, I'm sorry if I offended
you. It just keeps bothering me.

435
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,263
I still have a lot to do since
I arrived only yesterday.

436
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:07,303
Sorry I took up your time. Get going.

437
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:11,803
I will be leaving then.

438
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:25,124
One thing though. His
Majesty is not like that.

439
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:39,334
He's not like that? Are
you saying he doesn't bluff?

440
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,204
Or he doesn't fade at
night? Which one is it?

441
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,582
This is bothering me even more now! Gosh!

442
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,144
My gosh.

443
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,954
Thieves!

444
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:45,593
There are thieves!

445
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,763
Thieves! There are thieves!

446
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,263
Thieves!

447
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,704
Thieves! Over there!

448
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:57,274
Thieves!

449
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,363
Stop crying. Oh, no.

450
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:19,524
Stop crying. Okay?

451
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,004
My baby. My baby!

452
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,254
No!

453
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,374
Your Majesty.

454
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,443
It was not in the secret
storehouse I raided last night either.

455
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:48,583
Seeing how it was not...

456
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,324
at the most secretive place with
the highest level of surveillance,

457
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,954
is it possible that it is really
hidden in the tiger's den?

458
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,024
Your Majesty, the
Queen is here to see you.

459
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:09,202
I am very busy with state affairs.

460
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,572
We're on the same page.

461
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,044
That's what I wanted to talk about.

462
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:20,584
You must be so busy that
you're holding this upside down.

463
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:26,153
I had my reasons. I was
busy with my thoughts.

464
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:29,894
Finish your thoughts. I'll wait.

465
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,374
Why are you staring at me?

466
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:47,144
You know,

467
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,273
I was just thinking that
you sure are trying so hard.

468
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:54,144
Of course. As the king, I
ought to look after state affairs.

469
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:57,484
Is that jerk talking about
"affairs" on purpose?

470
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,507
I selected the Royal Concubine
which you desperately wanted.

471
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,322
You can start sleeping in your quarters.

472
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:03,493
I shall.

473
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:07,964
And you have nothing to tell me?

474
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,733
You came here to see me.

475
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:12,964
So you must have something to tell me.

476
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,903
Let's be honest since it's just us here.

477
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:17,943
Last night, we...

478
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:20,044
We had a great time.

479
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,684
Well, if that's how
you're going to play it...

480
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,734
My gosh.

481
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,133
You are distracting me.

482
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:51,372
If you don't want to talk about it,

483
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,173
why don't we come up
with our own hand signals?

484
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,374
Like this one.

485
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:56,473
What is that?

486
00:38:56,748 --> 00:39:00,084
This means whatever I'm saying is a lie.

487
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:02,484
What do you think? It's not that hard.

488
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,863
A king never lies.

489
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:14,763
You can go now.

490
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:22,934
My gosh. That's so annoying.

491
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,443
He keeps insisting that something
happened with such a straight face.

492
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,414
Now, I'm starting to wonder if
something really did happen.

493
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:32,343
Your Highness, it was
a tough day, was it not?

494
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:42,323
My gosh. It tickles.

495
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:44,593
Hey. My gosh.

496
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,323
Gosh. It tickles.

497
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:55,504
Your Highness.

498
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,004
Starting today, we will
begin your etiquette lessons.

499
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,513
I'm quite well-mannered.

500
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:08,754
It is a crash course on palace etiquette.

501
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,484
I don't want to.

502
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,693
It is an order from the
Grand Queen Dowager.

503
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,333
Whatever the King meant
by passing "the test"...

504
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,972
can't be more important than going back.

505
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:26,069
Winning the Grand Queen
Dowager over comes first.

506
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,903
You might not have guessed
it, but I took etiquette lessons...

507
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,243
in Cheonghak-dong at the age of four.

508
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:38,883
Do you want to see how
well-mannered a graduate can be?

509
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:51,294
A woman of the royal family
has the composure of Buddha.

510
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,334
When she walks, she
does not stir up the wind.

511
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,434
The candle lights do not flicker.

512
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,854
When she has her meal, she
must not open her mouth wide...

513
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:26,394
or take big bites of the food.

514
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:43,012
Embroidery is the best way for a woman...

515
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:44,584
to sort out her thoughts.

516
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:49,283
Embroidery. That is her specialty.

517
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:01,532
I'm not the one who's bad-mannered.
You're overly well-mannered.

518
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:02,863
You don't even want
me to breathe, do you?

519
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:04,162
This is worse than
staying in Cheonghak-dong.

520
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:05,334
Darn it.

521
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:16,374
Gosh, how can I eat such a pretty meal?

522
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:19,814
I should enjoy the
meal with my eyes first.

523
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:23,483
Is it just me? It sure looks like...

524
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:25,254
you are enjoying it with your mouth.

525
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,624
You used to love that.

526
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:35,093
Hong Yeon, have one. Open wide.

527
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:48,374
What is wrong, Your Highness?

528
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,084
Was that Kim So Yong's memory?

529
00:42:58,328 --> 00:42:59,624
My heart...

530
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:02,793
She has been poisoned.

531
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,492
Call the royal physician now!

532
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,763
Your Highness. Your Highness.

533
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,064
Please spit that out! Your Highness.

534
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:11,294
Your Highness. This isn't physical pain.

535
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:17,204
Does this woman like Cheoljong?

536
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,954
You should love me.

537
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,624
His eyes.

538
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,763
That's more than hatred. He despises her.

539
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:45,504
Please, Your Highness.

540
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:53,774
I enjoy the accompaniment
more than the liquor.

541
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,343
That is great.

542
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:58,012
All the liquor here is yours.

543
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,452
He had no intention to go
through with our first night together.

544
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,484
That's why he tried to make me drink.

545
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,923
We were thinking the same thing.

546
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,023
Now, all that remains is
your effort to produce an heir.

547
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:12,662
Please come to your
senses, Your Highness.

548
00:44:12,668 --> 00:44:14,363
Bring her some water!

549
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:15,392
In order to fool the Kim
clan who was trying to...

550
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:17,063
persuade him to sleep with her,

551
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,964
Cheoljong lied.

552
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:29,113
Hong Yeon. Nothing happened to me!

553
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:33,313
It was bothering me like crazy.

554
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:35,853
I trusted myself, but
I can't trust that jerk.

555
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:36,984
But...

556
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:41,894
What are you all doing?

557
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:03,044
More. Pull it up higher.

558
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,952
This is how exhausting it
is to maintain one's position.

559
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:12,024
Appearing decrepit means
that you have become weak.

560
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,552
If you do this twice a day,

561
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:17,524
you can prevent your
wrinkles from getting deeper.

562
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,664
I see. You work so hard.

563
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:23,794
But what brings you here?

564
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:26,463
After receiving the etiquette
class you have ordered,

565
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,003
I have had a deep realization
regarding how I should act...

566
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:30,704
as the queen.

567
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,774
That makes me happy.

568
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:37,214
That is enough. You can
stop. Yes, Your Highness.

569
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,359
But last night, as I was
in bed with His Majesty,

570
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:48,722
I felt my energy waver,

571
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:50,923
and I was unenthusiastic.

572
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,964
I thought about why that could
be, and I found the answer.

573
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,934
Since all the water in every
lake has been removed,

574
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:01,403
the yin energy is weak here.

575
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:03,773
I feel like if the lakes
are filled with water again,

576
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,802
I could bear a prince right away.

577
00:46:05,808 --> 00:46:07,073
That is unacceptable.

578
00:46:08,078 --> 00:46:11,372
Darn it. You almost died in the lake.

579
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:13,313
If we were to do things properly,

580
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:16,254
it would not be enough to punish
all those who assist you with death.

581
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:18,682
However, with such a joyous
event like your wedding coming up,

582
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:21,423
we thought there should not be
any bloodshed, so we were gracious.

583
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:26,723
If you wish to fill them up with
water, let us do what we must.

584
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:30,394
Hong Yeon, Court Lady
Choi, and who else is there?

585
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:35,033
Everyone who has responsibility
will receive a severe punishment.

586
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:38,173
She's savage. She's not
your average grandmother.

587
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:40,944
I will sleep with the
King for three nights.

588
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,642
I will sleep with the King...

589
00:46:42,648 --> 00:46:44,513
to conceive an heir as soon as possible.

590
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:47,443
Could you fill the lakes with
water as a gift for doing so?

591
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:48,584
Seven days.

592
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,553
Five days.

593
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:53,653
Listen here. Give all those who
assist the queen with a severe...

594
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:54,783
Seven days.

595
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:56,593
That is perfect.

596
00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:59,622
If you promise to fill the lakes
with water after seven days,

597
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:02,263
I will make sure to conceive a prince.

598
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:08,274
Prince or not, all I need to do is leave.

599
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,423
Royal Noble Consort
Eui has come to see you.

600
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:40,164
Goodness. You are as
graceful as I have been told.

601
00:47:40,808 --> 00:47:45,144
His Majesty has a good eye for women.

602
00:47:45,808 --> 00:47:47,443
You are too kind.

603
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,153
This is a gift.

604
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:00,523
It is something that you
need while living in the palace.

605
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,423
It is very important.

606
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,763
Please take it out.

607
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:23,044
This is how life in the palace is like.

608
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:25,282
There is no place you can lean on,

609
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:28,814
and once you feel nervous,
you cannot stop feeling so.

610
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:33,153
Oh, that is right. What is your
exact time and date of birth?

611
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:37,854
What must you do to create a prince?

612
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:41,932
Oh, my. Where is my head at?

613
00:48:41,938 --> 00:48:44,794
Your marital compatibility
must come first.

614
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:51,803
Tell me if you need a strong talisman.

615
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:57,144
There is a fortune-teller I
know who is an expert at curses.

616
00:48:57,248 --> 00:48:59,783
I received good results last time.

617
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:02,813
Your Highness, I apologize,

618
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,823
but I entered the palace in
order to assist His Majesty.

619
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,553
I am so silly.

620
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:13,894
I apologize, Your Highness.

621
00:49:14,268 --> 00:49:16,434
My speech and behaviour
were too resolute.

622
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:20,064
It is okay. Do not worry.

623
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,943
Speaking of which, your
investiture just happened,

624
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:28,743
but you will be spending
a long time alone.

625
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:32,243
Goodness. That is too
bad. What will you do?

626
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,283
Pardon?

627
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:37,383
The King and Queen
will be sleeping together...

628
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:39,484
for seven days.

629
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:41,853
There must be no thunder,

630
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:44,854
and there must be no fog or
wind during their time together.

631
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:47,794
Yet their time together has
been arranged consecutively.

632
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:50,894
Do not worry too much.

633
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:53,262
I am sure that His
Majesty's feelings for you...

634
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:56,033
will not change in that time.

635
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,303
You will end up...

636
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:30,104
losing someone precious to you too.

637
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,323
Your Highness.

638
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:05,403
I ruined it so badly that
I cannot fix this mess.

639
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,943
It is a waste, but I should throw it out.

640
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:15,214
Your character and everything
else is perfect to become the queen.

641
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,552
She has nothing to offer
but the power of her family,

642
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:20,452
but she is pushing His Majesty so much.

643
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:21,624
Look here.

644
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,164
The queen can be considered another king.

645
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:27,624
There is a duty that
comes with your position,

646
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:29,293
so you must hold your tongue.

647
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,833
However, it is obvious she
had the royal palace court lady...

648
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,863
to manipulate the period
that they get to spend together.

649
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,504
Furthermore, she blamed you
for something you did not do.

650
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:38,434
Why did that have to happen
when you were passing by?

651
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,243
I have not adjusted
to life in the palace.

652
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,184
This mouth of mine...

653
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:52,084
I apologize, Your Highness.

654
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:59,693
What can I do this time for His Majesty?

655
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,443
You told me to sleep in the royal villa,

656
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,544
but you had the Grand Queen
Dowager arrange for us to sleep together.

657
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:20,484
It is very hard to
understand a woman's heart.

658
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:24,354
I have a favour to ask.
Will you do it for me?

659
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:27,984
Of course. It is a request
from you, My Queen.

660
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:31,322
Let's install a no-touching rule.

661
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:33,463
I do not want to. You said you would.

662
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:34,993
I have never heard that word before.

663
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:37,063
You didn't even know
what I said, but you refused?

664
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,633
I refused because I do not
know what you are saying.

665
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:44,073
Listen carefully, Your Majesty.

666
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:48,142
No touching means that we
will live happily separately.

667
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:49,374
It's a good thing.

668
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:51,813
For example, we'll say
we're sleeping together,

669
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:54,714
but you'll be happy at the royal
villa, and I will be happy here.

670
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,914
So let's have a no-touching rule.

671
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,624
However, I do not want to.

672
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:02,854
Why do you keep refusing?

673
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:07,294
For some reason, your
behaviour upsets me.

674
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:09,794
This crazy king.

675
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:15,473
Only a lunatic knows how
to deal with another lunatic.

676
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:20,774
I don't remember what
happened last night,

677
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:22,644
so what if we reviewed it?

678
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:25,314
HN. Okay?

679
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:27,713
HN?

680
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:29,153
A hot night.

681
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:30,783
Tonight...

682
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:34,383
is our real first night together.

683
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:42,794
If that is the case...

684
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:55,943
Hey. Hurry! They'll see you.

685
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:58,843
A king never runs.

686
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:00,544
Darn you.

687
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,883
Oh, Court Lady Choi!

688
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:16,093
This could get you in deep
trouble, Your Highness.

689
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:18,492
I must see what the
commoners are enduring...

690
00:54:18,498 --> 00:54:20,863
to become a sage queen.

691
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:22,434
Your intentions are highly admirable,

692
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,372
but it is just too dangerous.

693
00:54:24,378 --> 00:54:27,142
I would even die if you
tell me to, but this is...

694
00:54:27,148 --> 00:54:28,303
The map.

695
00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:33,914
But this time... The identification tag.

696
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:37,914
I cannot let you do this.

697
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,423
The name is...

698
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:41,684
"Lee Saeng Mang".

699
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,624
What an ominous name.

700
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:46,992
"Saeng" means "to observe",
and "Mang" means "effort".

701
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:50,434
An observer who makes efforts
for our nation. It is a great name.

702
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:54,704
Well, sure. It's not my name anyway.

703
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,702
What time does the curfew start? At 11pm,

704
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,403
they will ring the
evening bell 28 times...

705
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,803
and close the gate.

706
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:03,814
Oh, they'll ring some kind of bell?

707
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:06,443
At 11pm, right?

708
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:11,153
Too bad. That's like prime time.

709
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:13,653
Okay.

710
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,854
I promise I'll be back before that.

711
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,222
No.

712
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:19,822
I will do everything in my power...

713
00:55:19,828 --> 00:55:21,993
to make sure Your Highness cannot leave.

714
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:34,144
Hong Yeon.

715
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:36,843
What kind of person was I?

716
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:39,984
You were always...

717
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:44,583
kind and optimistic.

718
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:46,822
You always smiled a lot,

719
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:48,624
and you were friendly to others.

720
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:52,323
You know, I'd rather
hear the truth from you...

721
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:54,263
than from others.

722
00:55:54,929 --> 00:55:56,033
That is true.

723
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:58,693
Then...

724
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,303
Once, when you were reading a book...

725
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:13,343
I cannot focus on the book.

726
00:56:14,648 --> 00:56:16,853
Your noisy breathing...

727
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,084
is ringing in my ears.

728
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:23,693
Get in here! Drag him out and flog him!

729
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:26,122
I suffer from chronic rhinitis.

730
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,392
Forgive me, Your Highness!

731
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:28,693
Come on.

732
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,943
You are offbeat by a quarter note.

733
00:56:45,788 --> 00:56:47,984
You have such an awful sense of rhythm.

734
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,883
How dare you call yourself a teacher?

735
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:52,584
Anybody there?

736
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,124
This witch ought to be flogged!

737
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,954
Really? My gosh!

738
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:02,533
How dare you laugh?

739
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:05,504
I suppose life is easy for you.

740
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:09,604
Take these two and
give them a good flogging!

741
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:11,503
When someone sighed before you,

742
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:12,972
you said, "How dare you sigh?"

743
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:13,972
When someone smelled good...

744
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:15,242
"How dare you try to seduce the King?"

745
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:16,642
You complained about
others' loud steps...

746
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,273
as well as gentle
steps for being arrogant.

747
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:19,842
Gosh, you nitpicked about everything.

748
00:57:19,848 --> 00:57:23,084
You went bonkers when
anything got on your nerves.

749
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:26,484
So everyone called you a witch.

750
00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:32,723
I apologize.

751
00:57:34,128 --> 00:57:35,963
I wanted to give you
a detailed description...

752
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:37,493
but got carried away.

753
00:57:37,898 --> 00:57:41,004
Sounds like many people must've
wanted to push her into the lake.

754
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:43,573
Is that why the court ladies...

755
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:46,803
It is because they do not
know what you are really like.

756
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:49,214
But you do?

757
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:50,814
Of course.

758
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:54,044
I have been serving
you since I was little,

759
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,383
so I know that you
have a warm, kind heart,

760
00:57:56,788 --> 00:57:58,412
and you are incredibly smart.

761
00:57:58,418 --> 00:58:00,853
Once you set your mind to something,
you make sure you achieve it.

762
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:02,223
You are one inspiring lady.

763
00:58:04,429 --> 00:58:07,664
You have just been a little
lonely since coming to the palace...

764
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:12,734
because His Majesty is openly
affectionate toward another woman.

765
00:58:15,139 --> 00:58:17,374
This woman wasn't
always lonely after all.

766
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,403
She has someone who understands her.

767
00:58:21,148 --> 00:58:22,843
"This woman"?

768
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:26,084
I was just saying, I'm
not lonely thanks to you.

769
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:29,513
You flatter me, Your Highness.

770
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,084
Don't worry, Hong Yeon.
Just get a good night's sleep.

771
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,894
I'll make sure I won't
get caught for your sake.

772
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,960
Gosh! I will kill you all!

773
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:45,970
Take my other eye too, you scoundrels!

774
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:49,940
I will not let you take my
wife and child as slaves!

775
00:58:50,544 --> 00:58:51,739
If you cannot pay your taxes,

776
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:53,239
you have no choice
but to let us take them!

777
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,869
That punk has committed many sins!

778
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,639
My only sin...

779
00:58:56,884 --> 00:59:01,210
is bringing my child
into this horrible world!

780
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,820
Stay away! Do not come near me.

781
00:59:07,395 --> 00:59:10,089
That crazy rat is even
guilty of treason now!

782
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:12,359
If killing scoundrels like you is
considered treason, I will do it.

783
00:59:12,365 --> 00:59:14,530
Yes! I will gladly do it!

784
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:16,630
My dear!

785
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:20,970
Do not do it.

786
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:24,093
I understand you are
upset, but do not do this.

787
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:28,809
Those scoundrels want us dead.

788
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,240
Why are you telling me to stop?

789
00:59:33,714 --> 00:59:34,849
Dam Hyang.

790
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:46,329
Move! Out of the way! Move!

791
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:50,829
My goodness.

792
00:59:51,265 --> 00:59:52,499
Gosh, what do we do?

793
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:20,530
Father, you are back.

794
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:23,059
Yes, how was your trip?

795
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:26,069
I apologize for missing...

796
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:27,269
such a joyous event.

797
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:29,739
Have you made up your mind?

798
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,599
Which position are you leaning toward?

799
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:34,840
I have decided on the
direction of my dream.

800
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:38,340
But as for its scope, I am not sure yet.

801
01:00:38,584 --> 01:00:39,909
Its scope?

802
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:44,079
All right.

803
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:46,849
Since I trust you, I will not rush you.

804
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:51,619
But something happened
while you were away.

805
01:00:52,225 --> 01:00:54,628
The Queen fell into the lake...

806
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:56,499
the night before her wedding.

807
01:00:57,165 --> 01:01:00,228
She was unconscious for a full day,

808
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:02,670
so we had to postpone the wedding.

809
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:04,769
How is Her Highness now?

810
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:06,610
Is she okay?

811
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:18,979
You, stop there!

812
01:01:24,865 --> 01:01:26,829
I have not seen you before in the palace.

813
01:01:27,294 --> 01:01:29,860
Seeing how you are
looking around, in a rush...

814
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,069
Well... Your first time in the palace?

815
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:34,530
I suppose you are lost.

816
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,440
I got lost too when I first came here.

817
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:38,800
That's right.

818
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:47,710
You look familiar for some reason.

819
01:01:51,685 --> 01:01:53,248
Luxurious clothes...

820
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:56,289
and that unguarded, confident attitude.

821
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,460
He must be from a rich family.

822
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:02,059
I was about to say the same thing.

823
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:04,598
You're that famous son
of the prestigious family.

824
01:02:04,604 --> 01:02:06,398
That handsome son of
the highly respected family.

825
01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:07,929
You are smart and are
also skilled in martial arts.

826
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:09,969
I have heard so much
about you. Your name was...

827
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:11,099
Kim Hwan.

828
01:02:11,805 --> 01:02:13,710
Kim Hwan from the Andong Kim clan.

829
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:15,538
Gosh, that means he's her relative.

830
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:17,179
Am I that famous?

831
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:19,880
Yes, you really are.

832
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,619
Even all the commoners outside
the palace know about you.

833
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:25,150
It is an honour to meet you.

834
01:02:25,424 --> 01:02:27,249
I was on my way out too.

835
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:28,619
Let us go together.

836
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:31,389
Oh, I came from that way.

837
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,360
I was confused as it is too dark now.

838
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:41,269
Slain like this.

839
01:02:42,404 --> 01:02:44,469
Gosh, he's so chatty.

840
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:45,909
He won't stop talking even for a second.

841
01:02:45,915 --> 01:02:48,869
That is why it is a little spooky here.

842
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:54,079
And that is the reason His
Majesty has a nightmare every night.

843
01:02:55,015 --> 01:02:56,150
Nightmare?

844
01:02:57,354 --> 01:03:00,549
His Majesty has been
having the same nightmare...

845
01:03:00,555 --> 01:03:03,018
every night since his Ganghwa days.

846
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:04,220
It is about...

847
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,530
being accused of treason...

848
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:09,059
and getting beheaded.

849
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:16,038
I apologize I did not recognize you.

850
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:18,769
Do not worry. Countless people
walk in and out of this gate daily.

851
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:22,679
"Lee Saeng Mang"

852
01:03:30,584 --> 01:03:33,148
Since I made such a good friend today,

853
01:03:33,154 --> 01:03:35,348
I would like to visit a kisaeng parlour.

854
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,720
Which one is the best?

855
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:40,329
Oktajeong. It is the best one.

856
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:43,699
The ladies' laughter
sounds like what you hear...

857
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:46,869
when you beat a jade tablet.
Hence the name, Oktajeong.

858
01:03:49,004 --> 01:03:50,470
Please join me.

859
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:52,339
Look at the bright moon.

860
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:54,940
It's the perfect night to have some fun.

861
01:03:57,484 --> 01:03:58,639
Here you go.

862
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:00,010
Let's go.

863
01:04:00,415 --> 01:04:02,380
Take it easy. Thank you.

864
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:06,590
We seem to be around the same age,

865
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:10,659
and we even share the same
hobby. I am very glad that we met.

866
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,690
Oh, right. You have not
told me your name yet.

867
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:15,960
What is your name?

868
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:17,960
I'm Lee Saeng Mang.

869
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:26,570
Lee Saeng Mang, as in
"A failure in this lifetime".

870
01:04:31,044 --> 01:04:32,179
Take it easy.

871
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:39,389
What is your name?

872
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:43,289
Yes, that's it.

873
01:04:49,064 --> 01:04:51,229
Oh, my apologies.

874
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:02,570
You are a woman.

875
01:05:03,245 --> 01:05:05,478
What are you talking
about? I'm obviously a man.

876
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:09,420
We do not let women in here as customers.

877
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,929
Girls, come and greet this young master!

878
01:05:40,754 --> 01:05:42,110
Yes!

879
01:05:47,955 --> 01:05:50,490
It is an honour to meet you.

880
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:00,769
Please allow me to pour you one...

881
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:08,769
I never have more
than three drinks a day.

882
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:10,679
I have already had two,

883
01:06:10,685 --> 01:06:13,579
and I wish to have the last
one with a friend of mine.

884
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:18,079
He is a man of principle.

885
01:06:20,254 --> 01:06:24,360
His son recently passed
the civil service examination.

886
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:26,329
Congratulations.

887
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:29,288
Even though he is very competent,

888
01:06:29,294 --> 01:06:31,800
he was not able to get a
good position in Hanyang.

889
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:35,498
If you can guide him, I
will be happy to pay you...

890
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:37,800
no matter how much you ask for.

891
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,670
Are you asking me to sell you...

892
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:44,840
a government position for money?

893
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,349
Well, what I meant was...

894
01:06:48,015 --> 01:06:50,648
I would just like to
express my deep gratitude.

895
01:06:50,654 --> 01:06:54,320
From what I know, your son
passed the exam a while ago.

896
01:06:55,055 --> 01:06:57,389
Why come to me now? That is...

897
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:03,260
You must have reached out
to the Pungyang Jo clan first.

898
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:10,069
My wife is their distant relative.

899
01:07:10,075 --> 01:07:11,800
Please forgive me.

900
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:25,749
I understand you are deeply worried...

901
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:28,119
that your smart, competent
son might not be able...

902
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,390
to achieve his goals due
to the family's past mistakes.

903
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:35,359
I will help him clear his name
and become a royal secretary.

904
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:37,399
A royal secretary?

905
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:41,100
Thank you. Thank you very much!

906
01:07:41,335 --> 01:07:42,699
And you do not need to pay me.

907
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:46,609
I just need a friend.

908
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:50,079
Someone who would
gladly risk his life for me.

909
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:55,749
As of this moment,
everyone in my family...

910
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:57,680
will gladly do that for you, my lord.

911
01:08:02,865 --> 01:08:04,590
Pour me one,

912
01:08:04,925 --> 01:08:06,789
since we are friends now.

913
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:09,859
Yes! I am much obliged.

914
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:22,310
All right, come on in! Okay.

915
01:08:23,844 --> 01:08:26,449
We shall drink until we drop.

916
01:08:26,455 --> 01:08:29,210
We will let it all go and
have some serious fun!

917
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:33,119
My gosh.

918
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:35,350
Take me too.

919
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:38,058
Gosh! Look here!

920
01:08:38,064 --> 01:08:39,859
Here, drink this.

921
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:42,088
There we go. Nice.

922
01:08:42,094 --> 01:08:44,100
Young Master!

923
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:47,529
You're so handsome.

924
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:54,209
Which one of you will
have the pleasure of...

925
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,579
undressing me tonight?

926
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,980
I have been a kisaeng for 20 years,

927
01:09:06,495 --> 01:09:09,890
yet I have never seen
such a pervert before.

928
01:09:11,094 --> 01:09:14,829
Here, have a drink. Come
on. Do not be like that.

929
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:34,050
This is awful.

930
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:40,119
I cannot believe we are
drinking alone at a place like this.

931
01:09:41,154 --> 01:09:43,659
It is not the time to
complain about such a thing.

932
01:09:43,694 --> 01:09:46,659
We thought it would be at the
secret storehouse, but it was not there.

933
01:09:46,894 --> 01:09:49,029
That leaves us with one option.

934
01:09:49,035 --> 01:09:50,258
The Queen's father's residence.

935
01:09:50,264 --> 01:09:54,270
But they want to appoint him
as the royal guard commander,

936
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,268
which means it will be
even harder to sneak in now.

937
01:09:56,274 --> 01:09:58,315
They want control over
the Royal Guard Division...

938
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:00,838
because they want the King's
life in the palms of their hands.

939
01:10:00,844 --> 01:10:04,508
It is only a matter of time before
the guards' disguise is caught.

940
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:07,779
What? Then this is a dangerous situation.

941
01:10:08,215 --> 01:10:11,079
If they get caught and have to disband,

942
01:10:11,085 --> 01:10:13,449
going after the corrupt
officials at night...

943
01:10:13,455 --> 01:10:15,688
and raiding storehouses
to find illegal ledgers...

944
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:17,758
will be our job.

945
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:19,119
So I will be a public
official during the day...

946
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,188
and an assassin at night?

947
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:22,989
I will be overworked.

948
01:10:23,904 --> 01:10:25,300
Gosh.

949
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:29,869
Did you make me leave
Ganghwa to work me like a dog?

950
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:34,739
On my way to Hanyang,

951
01:10:34,745 --> 01:10:38,380
my heart was filled with
ambition and big dreams.

952
01:10:39,514 --> 01:10:42,850
"I shall use my friend
and become successful."

953
01:10:45,085 --> 01:10:48,249
I told you that I wished to
save our rotting, corrupt country,

954
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:50,460
and you decided to follow along.

955
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,859
You did not word it like that.

956
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:56,730
You always talked about
Hanyang, so I asked you about it.

957
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,100
And this is exactly what you said.

958
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,199
Why go to Hanyang?

959
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:13,409
Joseon is rotting. I want to
teach those scoundrels a lesson!

960
01:11:19,995 --> 01:11:21,220
Right, I did.

961
01:11:22,724 --> 01:11:24,989
It sounded so cool,

962
01:11:24,995 --> 01:11:26,959
but I had no idea that
meant I had to work this hard.

963
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:30,800
I was such an idiot back then.

964
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:34,699
Do you think you have changed a lot?

965
01:11:40,474 --> 01:11:43,379
Are they trying to obtain control
over the Royal Guard Division...

966
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,239
because they have figured
out what we are up to?

967
01:11:45,245 --> 01:11:46,348
No way.

968
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:48,249
Had that been the case, they
would have sent someone here...

969
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:49,850
to eavesdrop on our conversation.

970
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:51,550
Wait, that is true.

971
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:58,920
What is your name?

972
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,430
Gosh, this is so uncomfortable.

973
01:12:04,104 --> 01:12:05,399
Gosh, I am drunk.

974
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:12,600
Where is the washroom?

975
01:12:17,085 --> 01:12:18,710
There it is.

976
01:12:24,724 --> 01:12:28,050
"Women's Room, Men's Room"

977
01:12:36,564 --> 01:12:37,699
What?

978
01:12:51,085 --> 01:12:52,539
Hey.

979
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:55,909
I'm jealous.

980
01:12:56,825 --> 01:12:58,880
I used to have that too.

981
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,119
But it's no longer mine.

982
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:07,659
Bye, my dragon.

983
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,659
Goodbye, my dragon.

984
01:13:14,434 --> 01:13:16,539
I can't even relieve myself standing up.

985
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:19,938
In this unfair world,
it's a privilege granted...

986
01:13:19,944 --> 01:13:21,270
only to those who have it.

987
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:25,710
I'm so sad that I no longer want to pee.

988
01:13:26,045 --> 01:13:27,749
Even my tears have dried up.

989
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,999
I no longer have my dragon.

990
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:47,430
Even my dragon balls are gone.

991
01:13:48,835 --> 01:13:50,999
It would've been better to just die.

992
01:13:52,005 --> 01:13:54,840
This is so cruel. Why must
you do this to me? Why?

993
01:13:57,014 --> 01:13:58,579
Pour me one. Here.

994
01:14:02,715 --> 01:14:04,178
My, this is nice.

995
01:14:04,184 --> 01:14:06,949
What are we going to do about this?

996
01:14:10,094 --> 01:14:11,260
What?

997
01:14:12,495 --> 01:14:14,159
Do you think they
have also figured out...

998
01:14:14,165 --> 01:14:16,800
that the blood on the marital
bed was actually pig's blood?

999
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:19,529
The fact that they want to give
that position to the Queen's father...

1000
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:22,829
means they have no
idea what we are up to.

1001
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:24,439
Otherwise,

1002
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:28,039
you and Officer Hong would
have been beheaded already.

1003
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:32,638
Then why, all of a sudden...

1004
01:14:32,644 --> 01:14:34,508
The only change is that the Queen...

1005
01:14:34,514 --> 01:14:36,555
and Royal Noble Consort
Eui are now in the palace.

1006
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:40,020
The Queen must want to keep
Royal Noble Consort Eui in check.

1007
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:43,218
She is pointing the sword...

1008
01:14:43,224 --> 01:14:45,659
at her husband's neck as
soon as the wedding is over?

1009
01:14:46,694 --> 01:14:48,590
That woman scares me.

1010
01:14:49,264 --> 01:14:50,798
Considering what happened,

1011
01:14:50,804 --> 01:14:52,804
we should stop looking
for it for the time being.

1012
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:54,468
We are preparing for...

1013
01:14:54,474 --> 01:14:56,670
a justified war against those in power.

1014
01:14:56,774 --> 01:14:59,970
The only way we can punish them is...

1015
01:15:00,115 --> 01:15:04,079
if we manage to find documents
to prove their corrupt acts.

1016
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:08,310
The double bookkeeping is
at the core of it, so we cannot...

1017
01:15:08,915 --> 01:15:10,478
delay getting our hands on their ledgers.

1018
01:15:10,484 --> 01:15:12,380
Then what do we do?

1019
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:15,489
We will just let them take the
royal guard commander position.

1020
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:17,989
However... If we throw bait,

1021
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:19,319
they will be all over it...

1022
01:15:19,325 --> 01:15:21,460
and fail to see what is
really going on around them.

1023
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:23,600
He will be preoccupied
with his new position,

1024
01:15:23,904 --> 01:15:26,770
and it will help us figure
out where the ledgers are.

1025
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:30,539
As for the position, we
can take it away from him...

1026
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:32,069
when he thinks that it is fully his.

1027
01:15:32,104 --> 01:15:34,010
Protecting the position
from them is hard,

1028
01:15:34,274 --> 01:15:35,808
but getting it back will be even harder.

1029
01:15:35,814 --> 01:15:38,308
Only a true warrior deserves to
lead the Royal Guard Division.

1030
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:40,279
I understand that he
will be a mere puppet,

1031
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,609
but he will not be able to last...

1032
01:15:41,615 --> 01:15:43,279
if he is physically unfit for the job.

1033
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:46,419
We will plan a little accident...

1034
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:48,888
on his first day at the new job.

1035
01:15:48,894 --> 01:15:52,289
But what if Kim Mun Geun is
more quick-witted than we think...

1036
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:55,230
and figure out who the guards really are?

1037
01:15:56,394 --> 01:15:58,884
Then we will make sure to
protect the Royal Guard Division...

1038
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:00,928
and get our hands on the ledgers.

1039
01:16:00,934 --> 01:16:02,899
It will be our last resort.

1040
01:16:03,234 --> 01:16:05,398
If you already know of a
way, why not just do it now?

1041
01:16:05,575 --> 01:16:07,340
What is that "last resort"?

1042
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:12,109
Assassination.

1043
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:19,619
It is bound to happen anyway.

1044
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,600
What is this drab room?

1045
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:01,130
Darn it.

1046
01:17:01,694 --> 01:17:03,090
The bell is ringing!

1047
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:15,008
That was the Queen, right?

1048
01:17:15,014 --> 01:17:17,178
Did she follow us here
disguised as a man?

1049
01:17:17,184 --> 01:17:18,680
We must not let her leave.

1050
01:17:18,844 --> 01:17:21,749
We do not even know how much
of our conversation she heard.

1051
01:17:21,755 --> 01:17:23,409
And I am sure someone is here with her.

1052
01:17:23,484 --> 01:17:26,279
Which means, we must
run after her and silence her.

1053
01:17:33,694 --> 01:17:34,829
Your Majesty.

1054
01:17:43,844 --> 01:17:46,340
Do not let your personal
feelings get in the way.

1055
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,109
I will do it myself.

1056
01:18:33,024 --> 01:18:34,149
10.

1057
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:39,020
11.

1058
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:43,090
Gosh, I'll be in trouble if I
don't make it back on time.

1059
01:18:43,194 --> 01:18:44,359
Darn it.

1060
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:04,779
"Mr. Queen"

1061
01:20:20,894 --> 01:20:23,598
Your Highness, do not trust anybody.

1062
01:20:23,604 --> 01:20:25,727
Be especially careful of
those who are close to you.

1063
01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:29,598
You know who did it.

1064
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:30,739
The culprit is...

1065
01:20:30,745 --> 01:20:32,598
If the Queen heard everything,

1066
01:20:32,604 --> 01:20:35,109
bloodshed is bound to occur.

1067
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:36,239
Who are you?

1068
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:38,709
How dare a woman set foot in here?

1069
01:20:38,715 --> 01:20:40,409
When I'm here,

1070
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:41,879
I'm the boss.

1071
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:43,749
Is this how you hold it?
