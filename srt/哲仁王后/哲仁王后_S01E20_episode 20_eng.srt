00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,070
   

3
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,900
   

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,130
   

5
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,780
Stop!

6
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,280
- Search them. 
 - Yes!

7
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,300
There's nothing wrong.

8
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,590
We've arrived.

9
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,660
Search for the king in each and every cart of commodities very thoroughly.

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,140
Yes.

11
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,740
- Your Majesty! 
 - Dosulli.

12
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,280
The k-king!

13
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,060
I've finally caught that bastard.

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,130
When is the coronation going to start?

15
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,900
- It will be at the time of the lamb.  (1:00 - 3:00 p.m.)   
 - Then we have enough time, right?

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,170
But we can't become relaxed. Let's hurry.

17
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,940
Wait.

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,450
- What was that? 
 - I don't know, either...

19
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,360
This much will be all right to spare.

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,050
Now, let's go.

21
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,060
Yes.

22
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,530
   

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,110
Your Majesty...

24
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,280
Wait a bit, I haven't finished the packing yet.

25
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,720
Your Majesty,

26
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,050
how wronged you must feel

27
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,020
that your soul is still wandering around this world?

28
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,780
Your Majesty...

29
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,450
Head Eunuch... come with me.

30
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,370
C-Come with you?

31
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,000
G-Get lost now!

32
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Your Majesty, I hope you reach nirvana.

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,890
Let's go. Come with me.

34
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,040
Your Majesty?

35
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,120
Your Majesty?

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,110
- Your Majesty! You're aliv— 
 - Shush!

37
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,840
Oh my goodness! Your Majesty, what happened?

38
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,760
That scarf looks good on your dragon robe, too.

39
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,750
My crazy sense (of style) is indeed good.

40
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,230
Over there!

41
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,280
This way!

42
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,450
What the...

43
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,030
Oh, yes!

44
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,080
How come you're so good at that?

45
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,770
Well, shall I say, it's the vibe from my experiences?

46
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,670
W-What's from your experiences?

47
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,730
Whenever I'm holding a knife, I let fly, you know.

48
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,190
Stop doing any useless attempts.

49
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,440
How many soldiers are stationed in the palace at the moment?

50
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,420
 (Without honorifics)  You're too late.  That's the sound announcing the coronation.

51
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,170
How dare you drop honorifics with me!!

52
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,810
The coronation is already starting?

53
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,600
 First bow! 
 (T/N: A formal bowing rite by the royal family) 

54
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,250
Four bows!

55
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,020
Please stand upright.

56
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,000
They've moved up the coronation!

57
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,690
Excuse me, you know...

58
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,210
Well... Just in case, I took out some insurance.

59
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,280
What are you doing? You should hurry up and proceed!

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,140
Well...

61
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,890
The Royal Seal has disappeared!

62
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,020
The Royal Seal is gone!

63
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,030
I must have gone crazy!

64
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,050
Because of those damnable words of "special mission,"

65
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,560
my heart heated up again...

66
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,020
 Raise your head. 

67
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,180
 This is the first time meeting you, Your Majesty. 

68
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,740
 The Queen? 

69
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,790
 L-L-Lee Saeng-mang! 

70
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,030
 This situation now is... Have you gone crazy 

71
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,340
 or have I gone crazy? 

72
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,690
Stole the Royal Seal?

73
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,930
You know I'm a bit crazy.

74
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,760
If so, we still have a chance.

75
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,500
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

76
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,700
Darn it, it opened easily last time.

77
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,860
- Do it better— 
 - Quiet, quiet!

78
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,980
This man...

79
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
 Sir! 

80
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,660
Is it you again?

81
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,330
Gosh, I told you not to come!

82
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,110
The thing is... because there are no other people but you that I can ask this.

83
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,880
I stole a small item because of the queen's request.

84
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,750
This is shiny and looks precious, so it's somewhat very ominous.

85
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,890
What is that?

86
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,260
The Royal Seal!

87
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,940
What!

88
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,050
Where do you think you came after stealing the Royal Seal?

89
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,440
Of course, it's the Royal Investigation Bureau.

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,070
Did I just walk into jail with my own feet?

91
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,610
W-Why are you giving it to me?

92
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,530
What are you doing here?

93
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,100
I just came to see my friend's face for a moment.

94
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,890
You shouldn't do this. Please come out immediately.

95
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,860
Wait!

96
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,940
Who are you to touch my best friend's body?

97
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,420
Are you insane? How could you show him the Royal Seal so openly?

98
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,030
The Royal Seal?

99
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,490
Will you take a look?

100
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,250
- It's a bomb! 
 - Everyone, run!

101
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,910
They're attacking Hanyang?  All of the main gates of the capital?

102
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,110
Yes, My Lord.  If you allow us to use firearms—

103
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,380
For now, it's more important to finish the coronation safely, so just stand by with the firearms.

104
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,030
Mobilize all the troops and send them to each main gate of the city. Hurry up!

105
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,970
As soon as the coronation is done,

106
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,910
I'll wipe out all of you.

107
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,830
How can we proceed with the coronation without the Royal Seal!

108
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,630
What a disaster this is...

109
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,300
Brother, what on earth have you been doing?

110
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,570
How can you be so useless like this!

111
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,040
What is it?

112
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
So?

113
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,660
At the moment, because of the unidentified acrid smoke, it's not easy to attack them.

114
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Since the coronation needs to be completed safely, I sent all the troops to each gate of the city

115
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
and they're completely blocking them.

116
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,490
Attacking the West side after creating noise at the East side... 
  (T/N: Military strategy of diversion) 

117
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,550
What's going on?

118
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,030
It's nothing. I'll go and find the Royal Seal myself.

119
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,960
Call those troops back to the palace immediately!

120
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,450
- Pardon me? 
 - Did you not hear me!

121
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,060
Yes, My Lord.

122
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,100
How could this place be so empty like this?

123
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,970
This means that our people out there are doing a good job.

124
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,060
In the end, we've come this far.

125
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,730
Are you nervous?

126
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,630
I am nervous and...

127
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,830
I'm overwhelmingly excited.

128
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,410
That's right!  This feels as if the ultimate target is about to appear at the last stage in a game.

129
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,540
True, the ultimate target.

130
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,850
If I die before winning against the ultimate target, I can't help myself but curse

131
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,840
since I have to start again from the beginning.

132
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,830
To us, there is only one chance.

133
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,310
Gosh, it makes me so nervous.

134
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,470
Shall we go?

135
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,060
So, he got them.

136
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,570
My Queen!

137
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,630
Ah, I'm okay, I was just shocked by the sound.  It doesn't hurt at all.

138
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,610
My Queen!

139
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,000
My Queen!

140
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,730
My Queen, please, don't move!

141
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,570
We should go to stop the coronation, though...

142
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,050
You're my priority!

143
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,530
We should check the wound.

144
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,020
My King...

145
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,840
 Am I going to go back? 

146
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,900
No...

147
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,990
 Why now, of all other days? 

148
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,970
 Please... 

149
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,110
Just until after seeing if he survives...

150
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,800
Just until after checking if he's all right...

151
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,270
 My body?  Am I back? 

152
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,230
 What about Cheoljong?  

153
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,440
 No, I must save him. 

154
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,040
But how can I?

155
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,310
 It happened 200 years ago. 

156
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,550
   

157
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,930
Oh? Jang Bong-hwan?

158
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,530
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan!

159
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,350
Oh? Patient Jang Bong-hwan?

160
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,450
You shouldn't run suddenly like that! Patient Jang Bong-hwan!

161
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,040
- Mr. Jang Bong-hwan! 
 - Chase after him, after him!

162
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,240
 Mr. Jang Bong-hwan! 

163
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,570
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan, please stop there!  Just a moment!

164
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,420
- Wait there! 
 - Gosh, why is he running like crazy?

165
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,620
God, seriously...

166
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,250
- Oh?  
 - Oh?! No!

167
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,800
It must be good to be that young, damn.

168
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,290
Has he really been in a vegetative state for several months?

169
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,760
   

170
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,090
The Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty!

171
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,270
   

172
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,400
Please, don't die.  You can't die like that.

173
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,410
  ... 

174
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,740
   

175
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,420
   
(T/N: Changed from Cheoljong to Cheoljo - Jo is given to a king who accomplished great merits.) 

176
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,410
He's gone.

177
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,310
That man disappeared.

178
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,490
Your Majesty...

179
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,390
Your Majesty...

180
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,270
You can't leave like this.

181
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,950
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

182
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,060
Your Majesty.

183
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,150
Your Majesty.

184
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,410
My Queen, are you all right?

185
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm all right.

186
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,990
But you're bleeding a lot, Your Majesty.

187
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,850
Seeing that it hurts like I'm dying,

188
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,000
I guess I won't actually die.

189
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,720
These bulletproof vests saved both of us.

190
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,160
Oh, thank goodness...

191
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,510
What on earth are you doing?

192
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,490
A king working in league with the Thieves of Donghak?

193
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,760
So, I am still the king to you, then.

194
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,930
Why didn't you just stay still?

195
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,360
If you had stayed still while being satisfied with your given role, everyone would've been happy.

196
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm from the family of those whom you killed.

197
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:50,110
I am the king of those people who you trampled on!

198
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,890
So I can never stay still.

199
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,720
You seem to have a lot of trouble breathing.

200
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,960
So much so, you won't be able to avoid my sword!

201
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,450
Your Maje—

202
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,770
Baby, please... Please...

203
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,730
Please...

204
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,960
Kill me.

205
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,690
Live.

206
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,330
Living a humiliating life

207
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,630
is your punishment.

208
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,070
If you try to take your own life,

209
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,300
I'll make sure you stay alive by any and all means.

210
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,850
No matter how much your body is broken and ruined,

211
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,720
I'll make you breathe at least.

212
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,200
What is it like to live in only a shell?

213
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,590
You will get to engrave it deep within your bones.

214
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,230
Oh no!  What to do? Your specialty is to hide among crowds.

215
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,940
But now because of the curfew, there is not even a single ant.

216
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,650
You now have nowhere to hide anymore.

217
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,910
My Queen...

218
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,460
Please come back to me after finishing your fight, Your Majesty.

219
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,820
No, I won't.

220
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,940
There is nothing more important than you, My Queen.

221
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,110
Please don't worry,

222
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,600
since I will also get over this no matter what.

223
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,070
Your Majesty!

224
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,230
I'll escort Her Majesty the Queen.

225
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,520
You must leave, we never know how the situation will go if we delay.

226
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,750
♫  Shaking in the frozen time   ♫

227
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,570
Please hurry and go.

228
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,640
♫   Tired from walking at nights, I stopped    ♫

229
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,200
♫  Putting my longing in the wind   ♫

230
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,010
♫  I'm wandering, looking for you   ♫

231
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,040
I'll be back soon.

232
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,490
Yes.

233
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:17,490
♫  Where are you now, my love?   ♫

234
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Your Majesty, are you all right?

235
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,300
♫   Always standing at the same place   ♫

236
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,680
♫   Still I am, still I am   ♫

237
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,020
♫   I'm waiting for you   ♫

238
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,390
♫   In this time without answers   ♫

239
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,830
♫   Even if the entire world stops   ♫

240
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,900
♫   Here I am   ♫

241
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,280
You should find a way!

242
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,990
Why are all of you so useless like this!

243
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,550
You must show dignity as the king.

244
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,460
It's too scary, Your Royal Highness.

245
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,350
 (Without honorifics)  Keep your position!

246
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,380
Come down.

247
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,900
Your Highness the Grand Queen Dowager,

248
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,920
here I am to give you my greetings.

249
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,930
No...

250
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,660
   

251
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,960
 His Majesty the King! 

252
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,610
My Queen!

253
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,690
She's unconscious.

254
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,520
How is she?

255
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,930
There is a symptom of miscarriage.

256
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,360
She's having uterine bleeding.

257
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,470
If this continues, both Her Majesty and the baby she's carrying...

258
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,800
will be in danger.

259
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,920
Then, w-why-why are you taking all those needles out?

260
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,900
Right now, she's not even taking to acupuncture well either.

261
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,830
All we can do is now just wait for the two of them to overcome it themselves.

262
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,140
Tonight will be critical.

263
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,150
Your Majesty! Your Majesty...

264
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,360
Your Majesty, I'm afraid to ask this,

265
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,790
but since more treatment is needed, please leave the room for a moment.

266
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,740
Your Majesty, why don't we leave the room for a moment?

267
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,720
Your Majesty...

268
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,730
Your Majesty...

269
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,760
How could there be...

270
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,420
nothing I can do for her?

271
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:46,100
♫  The moment when I recognized you, 
 when everything changed  ♫

272
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,300
♫  Worried to be drifted further like a dream  ♫

273
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,730
My Queen...

274
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,400
♫  I love you, I love you, I'm very thankful  ♫

275
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,490
♫  For coming to me who was nothing  ♫

276
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,080
Both of them are now all right.

277
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,560
♫  I was full of mistakes  ♫

278
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,360
♫  But you embraced me who was stumbling as if crumbling  ♫

279
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Your Majesty...

280
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,460
♫  But you embraced me who was stumbling as if crumbling  ♫

281
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,860
Now, all in the world to me

282
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,570
are well, all of them.

283
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:42,510
♫  After I met you, everything is hovering like a dream  ♫

284
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:53,100
♫  Wherever you are, I can feel you  ♫

285
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:00,800
♫  As the wind blowing now must be you, too  ♫

286
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,390
Everything is over.

287
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,140
Who knew that scamp, the king, was really a man of ability.

288
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,570
 Your Royal Highness! 

289
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,610
Where do you think you are screaming like that?  How improper!

290
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,530
That's because...

291
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,240
The royal order is to move Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager to the Western Palace.  (The Western Palace was a lower grade palace, where deposed queens/concubines lived.)  

292
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,460
What did you say?

293
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,800
Are you saying he dares to confine me in the Western Palace?

294
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,880
Who on earth does he think I am?

295
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,480
What are you doing? Open it immediately.

296
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,200
The door is not opening, Your Highness.

297
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,310
Why aren't you opening this door immediately!

298
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,600
 Her Majesty the Queen! 

299
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,430
Open it.

300
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,810
I heard you were critically ill all night long, but now I see you are perfectly fine.

301
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,240
All is thanks to Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

302
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,910
Where are you trying to go?

303
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,330
Do I have to report it in detail to you, My Queen?

304
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,600
It's been decided to move your residence to the Western Palace, Your Royal Highness.

305
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,240
Until then, you must stay within this place, Tongmyeongjeon,

306
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,760
and you're forbidden to go outside of it.

307
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,440
Are you saying you, the queen, will dare to lock me up here?

308
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,100
You must be joking.

309
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,670
Move aside.

310
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,910
They can not.

311
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,340
I said, move aside right now!

312
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,760
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

313
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,840
If you're going to die, please die in this building.

314
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,230
What are you doing, Court Lady Cheon!

315
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,400
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

316
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,000
How dare you!

317
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,940
Your era is over now, Your Royal Highness.

318
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,410
Now, the owner of the Inner Court is me.

319
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,230
I'm the owner!

320
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,450
I've been leading it so far,

321
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,230
so it's mine!

322
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,950
Going forward, everything will change.

323
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,170
Especially, all those rules and courtesies you've made and kept so far,

324
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,060
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

325
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,910
They have been accumulated for hundreds, thousands of years!

326
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,280
You think those things will crumble in a moment!

327
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,960
They're already crumbling.

328
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,860
The change you were so afraid of...

329
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,710
has already begun.

330
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh, f***, that was so freaking satisfying!

331
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Court Lady Choi, what did I just say?

332
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,800
"Oh, f***, that was so freaking satisfying!"

333
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,530
That's what you said.

334
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,580
Maybe he awakened my hidden true nature.

335
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,440
This refreshing feeling deep in my mind.

336
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,470
I can't quit... Damn it! Oh, no...

337
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,380
Bulls***.

338
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,670
Oh, this feels great!

339
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,160
F*** you!

340
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,400
F***ing bastards!

341
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,180
Oh, f***.

342
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,760
What is this about?

343
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,430
"(Queen Dowager) Jo, the criminal, spread rumors to slander the queen,

344
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,990
and defamed the royal family's honor by causing doubts about the royal bloodline.

345
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,070
For the charge of putting the country in crisis,

346
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,940
this is the royal order confining her to the Western Palace."

347
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,040
This is another slander,

348
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,210
because I've never done such a thing.

349
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,120
Is that true?

350
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,250
On the honor of the former king,

351
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,420
I can swear that I've never done such a thing.

352
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,490
Come in, please.

353
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,610
"For the criminals, as follows, all their properties and wealth are to be confiscated

354
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,970
and after 100 strokes of flogging, they will be placed as government slaves under the Jeju Island Bureau.

355
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,030
However, their wives and children won't be punished through quilt-by-association.

356
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,150
Former Prime Minister Kim Byeong-hak, Former Right State Minister Jo Man-ho,

357
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,130
Former Left State Minister Kim Seok-geun, Former Minister of Military Kim Chang-yeob,

358
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,490
Former Chief Royal Secretary Kim So-hoon, Former Minister of Personnel Jo Deok-mun,

359
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,300
and all the rest of the people written on the pact will not be executed, but all their properties will be confiscated

360
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,550
and they will be imprisoned for three years."

361
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,810
 - We've been wronged, Your Majesty! 
 - We've been wronged! 

362
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:13,210
This was all because of the threat made by Kim Byeong-in who single-handedly plotted this treason,

363
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,980
but we never, never...

364
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,030
we never had any intention of plotting treason.

365
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,890
Please consider that, Your Majesty, please.

366
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,630
He's right, Your Majesty.

367
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:31,130
Our sin is just our foolishness of believing that false news

368
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,500
of Your Majesty being killed by the Thieves of Donghak.

369
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,220
Is that so? Then, I'll tell you, your other crimes.

370
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,350
Right now, in Joseon,

371
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,820
the people with full stomachs are the biggest sinners.

372
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,990
Among your lot, is there anyone who has gone hungry?

373
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,690
You have fattened your stomachs with the people's blood and tears.

374
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,830
You have forgotten your duty to govern the country and take care of the people.

375
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,220
You've put the people beneath your feet and just trampled on them.

376
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,290
You charged a huge tax on a rocky mountain that won't even yield to picks and forced the people to farm it,

377
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,480
and on that payment, you've pocketed even bigger taxes.

378
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,730
While you were lying down in a warm room and patting your full stomachs,

379
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,060
the people had to stay up all night on a cold ground, worrying about the next day.

380
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,630
"How can I fill my stomach more? How can I climb higher?  How can I become bigger?"

381
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,100
While you weren't even thinking of their desperation,

382
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
the people, whose very breaths were painful too,

383
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,060
couldn't even dare to dream about their futures,

384
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,750
but had to live the present in a living hell!

385
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,750
That was...

386
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,930
Your first crime was to treat your lives preciously while considering the people's lives lightly,

387
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,180
and the second one was to prevent them from dreaming of a future and made their present into hell.

388
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,450
The third crime was to give despair

389
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,380
to the fathers who couldn't protect their families and their country.

390
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,690
If anyone here is innocent of these charges,

391
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,000
come forward.

392
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,260
You must engrave all your crimes deep in your bones

393
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,790
and repent for them.

394
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,910
You are just...

395
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,170
shameless thieves.

396
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,970
Y-Your Majesty...

397
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,130
 That bastard is coming! 

398
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,310
That bastard deserves to be beaten to death!

399
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,320
Leave them behind.

400
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,240
But Your Highness uses them all the time.

401
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,870
Even if you wouldn't have any chance to see other people since you will be confined to the Western Palace, still—

402
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,430
The reason why I have kept you by my side, Court Lady Cheon,

403
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,600
is because you show your inner thoughts so thoughtlessly.

404
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,910
You can't have any second thought by nature.

405
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,340
True,

406
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,620
all people have their own way of living.

407
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,050
Your Highness, why don't you get mad at me like you always do?

408
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,090
Court Lady Cheon, you're so clueless until the last moment.

409
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:55,260
I'm holding back my tears, but how could you cry?

410
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,730
Your Highness...

411
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,630
I'll survive.

412
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,720
Surviving is...

413
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,140
winning after all.

414
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:17,920
 Hold my hand just until you escape safely. 

415
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,110
 - What are you scheming? 
 - If you remember, 

416
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,750
 then that means So-yong is still inside you. 

417
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,550
Orabeoni, you found me again.

418
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,890
The "me" hidden deep...

419
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,790
- What do I do? 
  - Really?

420
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,440
Oh, hey.

421
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,230
 - I'm sorry, Your Majesty. 
 - I'm sorry, Your Majesty. 

422
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,310
The sound of your laughing was nice.

423
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,660
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty. 
 - Your Majesty...

424
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,340
You've changed a lot, Your Majesty.

425
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,930
I wasn't like "me" for a while after the wedding, was I?

426
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,940
Just...

427
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,490
Consider that it was a big deal becoming the queen.

428
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,970
You've also changed a lot from the time before your wedding, Your Majesty.

429
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,770
Back then, the only choice I could make on my own

430
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,370
was death, I thought.

431
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:32,170
   

432
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,440
 Did you get back safely, Sir? 

433
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,760
   

434
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,920
 Your Majesty! 

435
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,240
- Father! 
 - No!

436
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,310
Please don't come since you're carrying a baby.

437
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,130
I'll come to you.

438
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,700
- How is your health? 
 - How is your health?

439
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,340
Father, you should speak first.

440
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,320
No, no! Your Majesty is first.

441
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,670
- I'm perfectly fine. 
 - I'm perfectly fine.

442
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,440
Have you been well?

443
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,930
Of course, of course. I'm saved, thanks to you, Your Majesty.

444
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,130
During that last coronation, because of the rebels who even came into the city,

445
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,960
all the noblemen were shaking in fear, you know?

446
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,060
But at that time, the villagers stepped forward and protected our manor.

447
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,720
Because it's the house of virtue that opened its storage to help them.

448
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,340
All I did was follow your instructions,

449
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,860
so I felt a bit embarrassed and sorry.

450
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,670
You can show them your virtue from now on.

451
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,640
Of course!  Of course, I should.

452
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,880
Even for the sake of our royal baby, I should become the respectable grandfather.

453
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,090
Is that a fetal movement?

454
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,330
Already fetal movements?

455
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,840
Is my grandchild a genius!

456
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,450
Is the onion smell too strong?

457
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,680
What are you making so diligently?

458
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:33,650
I'm trying to copy the queen's infamous Samhyang ramen.

459
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,450
Then, let me have some ramen before I go.

460
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,680
It'll cook quickly.

461
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,650
I expected I would be able to enjoy some leisurely time when the peaceful reign came, but why am I even busier now?

462
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,570
No one's here.

463
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,630
Hong Byeolgam.

464
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,630
Yes, I'm busy. Let's go and gamble some other time.

465
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,880
I've quit gambling.

466
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,820
You did?

467
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,680
Since the merit I accomplished this time was so huge,

468
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,870
His Majesty the King said he would give me an official position, don't you know?

469
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:29,710
I know, right?  While I'm still the same Hong Byeolgam.

470
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,640
Well, did you ask him for the position of Prime Minister, or what?

471
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,180
What is that ugly object?

472
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,350
How weak you are in new cultures.

473
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,740
This time, I've volunteered to be an ambassador under the Translation Department.

474
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,840
For someone like me, this Joseon land is too small.

475
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,340
Congratulations on quitting gambling.

476
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,440
What about the part of my becoming an ambassador?

477
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,270
Well, traveling around until you get blisters on your feet isn't something to be congratulated.

478
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,840
By the way, I still can't believe that Lee Saeng-mang was the queen.

479
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,010
I'm the one who can't believe you didn't catch on.

480
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,540
Du-il! Are you still not done with your work?

481
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,880
I see you are here, too.

482
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,840
It's been a while, Cheoljong.

483
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,990
If Lee Saeng-mang is the queen, then you must be—

484
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,780
A woman.

485
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,800
As expected, you have great senses!

486
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:57,500
I heard you got an official position this time.

487
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,330
I got it from the king.

488
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,670
My word.

489
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,460
Samwol, head in first.

490
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,520
Yes, My Lady.

491
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,690
How can I help you? It's very cold today, did you wait a long time?

492
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,190
No, I just got here—

493
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,970
What's wrong?

494
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,510
I got a sudden cramp.

495
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,030
Have you been well?

496
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,410
Yes. The king is doing well.

497
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:54,100
No. I was asking about you, Prince Yeongpyeong.

498
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
I—

499
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,410
Now, the Office of Correction for the Three Taxes is also properly established.

500
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,770
Thanks to you, my workload has increased and it's killing me.

501
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,300
Now, what's next?

502
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,790
I plan on giving power to each and every one of my people.

503
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,850
So that when combined, they will become more powerful than me.

504
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:34,410
So that corrupted people will never be able to flourish here again.

505
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,150
I think that's the end

506
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:43,850
of this difficult fight and the amazing journey.

507
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,020
That just sounds like I'm going to get busier.

508
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,430
Let's just get off work already.

509
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,590
Gosh.

510
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,990
Let's just go.

511
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:58,710
We're going to look at it again tomorrow morning anyways. Geez, we don't match.

512
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,770
You should at least clean up—

513
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,310
- Rest well. 
 - Yes.

514
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,230
You too should clean up before you—

515
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,770
Du-il! Gosh, that friend is...

516
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,840
   

517
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,580
Did I lose something?

518
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,950
Sometimes, my mind is...

519
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,420
He did it. He actually did it.

520
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,950
   

521
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:19,360
   

522
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,440
 My Queen. 

523
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,340
 Is it not funny? 

524
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,320
   

525
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,290
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan!

526
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,610
Don't you come near me!

527
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,050
 I have to find that bastard Director Han first. 

528
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,930
 No, would it be faster to just expose it to the media? 

529
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,050
Why do you keep running away when you've done a good deed?

530
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,430
Good deed?

531
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,120
Then, why are you monitoring a good person?

532
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,870
We were not monitoring but providing personal protection for a whistle-blower.

533
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,640
W-Whistle...

534
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,100
You know the CCTV in the storage room for ingredients?

535
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,020
You know, the one you fixed secretly.

536
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,900
I did?

537
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,810
 Wait. 

538
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,890
 You're the one who oversees the CCTVs? 

539
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:50,180
 It's weird that it keeps breaking down. We need to catch the thief. 

540
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,880
 Why did you do something so useless? It's unlike you, Jang Bong-hwan. 

541
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,180
 You're right. You should've come quicker to tell me, then. 

542
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,580
 I already caused trouble. 

543
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,340
 - What? 
 - I already spread the CCTV video all over the media companies for free. 

544
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,570
 How unlike me. 

545
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,690
 He's b-bluffing. 

546
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,370
 He probably is. 

547
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,840
 The Jang Bong-hwan I know isn't the righteous type. 

548
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,500
 Before he'd spread it to the media, 

549
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,150
 he's the type to cut a deal with me beforehand. Isn't that right? 

550
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:25,090
 You're right. That's the kind of guy I was. 

551
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,660
 But... I've changed. 

552
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,950
 Really? Why? 

553
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,640
 I don't know. I just felt like it. 

554
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,340
 You bastard! 

555
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,180
 Sous-chef Boo! 

556
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,170
 - Sous-chef Boo! 
 - Damn it! 

557
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:54,010
 Push! 

558
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,450
 Cheoljong succeeded in changing his fate and my fate changed as well. 

559
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,180
Then, why is Director Han still the same?

560
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,320
   

561
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,900
   

562
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,520
 Perhaps... did the world not change? 

563
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,810
 Did only Cheoljong and I change? 

564
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,050
   

565
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:37,550
     

566
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,040
   

567
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,580
   

568
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,950
 - Please look this way! 
 - Comment, please! 

569
01:00:54,950 --> 01:01:00,750
   

570
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,650
 Although history changed, 
   

571
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:11,350
 all those rotten bastards who commit corruption often survive by any and all means. 

572
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,960
 However, the good world isn't because it wasn't rotten,  

573
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,190
 but maybe because it can cut out the rotten things. 

574
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:24,410
 If you keep trying to change your life, the world will get changed someday.  

575
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,840
 Just like Cheoljong and I did. 

576
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,580
   (upside down) 

577
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,250
- Your Majesty. 
 - Huh?

578
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,600
- It should be rotated.  
 - Oh, yes.

579
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,800
Your Majesty, can't you focus?

580
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,550
The queen's face seems to flit before my eyes,

581
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,250
so I can't really focus.

582
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,700
This won't do. It will be better to concentrate again after seeing the queen.

583
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,420
Next.

584
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,780
I will allow the women of the Inner Court to marry

585
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,380
if they are over 18 years of age.

586
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:28,520
Also,

587
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,540
I'll forbid girls younger than 10 years to work in the Inner Court.

588
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,970
And...

589
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,300
What will be the next point, Your Majesty?

590
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,410
Your Majesty?

591
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,510
Sorry, Court Lady Choi.

592
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,670
Since earlier, you haven't been able to concentrate.

593
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,580
It hasn't been too long since you met His Majesty the King.

594
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,140
It's not me, but my baby.

595
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:05,640
For your prenatal education, what do you think of going and seeing His Majesty's face for a moment?

596
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,540
That's what I'm saying.

597
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,950
Your Majesty, I'm told that the queen is heading to Seonjeongjeon. 
  (King's study) 

598
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,510
Oh, dear!  We must have taken different routes.

599
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,340
His Majesty went to Daejojeon Hall. 
  (Queen's residence)? 

600
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,150
Yes.

601
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,710
Let's go together, Your Majesty.

602
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,310
She's so much in love.

603
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,300
Oh, dear!  We've missed each other again.

604
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,440
What is this, hide-and-seek or what?

605
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,680
This won't do.

606
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,810
In this kind of situation...

607
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:17,410
♫  Like the faded moonlight  ♫

608
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:19,440
We've finally met.

609
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:24,950
We've truly taken different routes so many times.

610
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:29,400
How that short moment felt like such a long time...

611
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:36,860
♫  Your soft heart that I can't understand even 
if I look in your eyes   ♫

612
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:45,740
♫  The darkness comes in the sky I was watching   ♫

613
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:54,550
♫  And at the moment your beautiful face is also soaked in   ♫

614
01:04:54,580 --> 01:05:01,240
♫  The stars sparkling in your eyes   ♫

615
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:06,050
By the way, why do you keep using honorifics with me?

616
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,210
You're trying to surprise me again, aren't you?

617
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:20,650
♫  Even the heart collapsing endlessly   ♫

618
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,990
♫  I want to embrace all of them   ♫

619
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:28,050
♫  Instead of the sorrow in your eyes   ♫

620
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,250
♫  I want to put me in them   ♫

621
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:36,570
♫  Wish you'd look back, please   ♫

622
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,940
   

623
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,970
