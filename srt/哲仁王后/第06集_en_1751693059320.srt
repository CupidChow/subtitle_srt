1
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,350
(This drama is purely fictional characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,180
Yeah, like this

3
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,820
(Episode 6)
Yeah, like this

4
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,450
Yeah, like this

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,420
In terms of weapons and strategy

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,340
When our troops are smaller than the enemy's

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,280
To avoid dangerous places

8
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,150
If you can't hold on

9
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,730
Need to find a way out...

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,260
She is so weird.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,750
I said, Your Majesty

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,880
She does all kinds of weird things.

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,710
Hehehe

14
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,060
How long do you want me to dance the ancestral temple dance?

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,990
I

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
But he was from the special forces.

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,780
The tone is extremely arrogant

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,550
Go ahead

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,240
You think you are the king?

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,720
I am the King

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,830
Thanks

22
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,721
You are poisonous, right?

23
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,011
Damn

24
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,771
Um

25
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,661
No, it's none of your business.

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,160
Get out of here

27
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,530
The action is quite rude.

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,200
Sometimes I make compassionate choices

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,010
therefore

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,660
Please don't let innocent people bleed.

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,140
Sometimes I get as angry as a devil

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,190
Now I'm not angry in this situation

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,160
Is that still a human?

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,190
It's Buddha.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,840
Maybe she's just very human.

36
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,460
Even though it's hard for me to understand

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,710
Too late

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,870
Now that you understand me, what can I do?

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,010
Is it really too late?

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,580
Is my explanation a bit hard to understand?

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,100
What did you just say?

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,040
You're not concentrating.

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,100
What are you thinking about?

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,060
Even your favorite military book...

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,170
Are you thinking about your Yipin again?

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,510
No

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,800
Really

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,190
How come?

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,910
Your Highness, your eyes

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,220
I was thinking about women...

51
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,520
I was just thinking about the middle temple

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,970
What

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,110
So stop saying these things.

54
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,510
The nave is for women

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,190
But in my eyes, she is not a woman

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,220
Don't you know

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,590
But her behavior is too weird.

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,840
It's normal for you to care.

59
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,940
The middle temple is better than anyone I have ever met

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,640
More unique and special

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,220
As if it came from another world

62
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,080
There is a word to describe

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,210
Such a queen in the palace

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,010
Outsiders

65
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,800
The world outside

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,220
Therefore, outsiders

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Outsiders

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,660
It's really wonderful

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,330
Outsiders

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,330
Um

71
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,600
The rain is finally stopping

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,870
It was so big before

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,810
I hope there won't be any disaster.

74
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,160
Who says it isn't?

75
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,650
It's so worrying.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,940
Why are you so weird?

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,080
When will you talk?

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,620
As of today

79
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,070
Only until today

80
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,420
Everything will be in place tomorrow.

81
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,230
Could she...

82
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,500
Open the door quickly

83
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,730
Imperial Order

84
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,930
Open the door

85
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,690
(Zhang Fenghuan visited here)

86
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,720
Are you okay?

87
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,100
Damn

88
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
What are you doing?

89
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,150
The one who wanted to kill me before

90
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,110
What are you doing?

91
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,300
I still want to commit suicide

92
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,550
Are you crazy?

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,600
What does my life or death have to do with you?

94
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,530
Don't you want me to die?

95
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,700
So don't stop me from walking away

96
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,950
It's not too late for me to understand you now

97
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,850
Just do as you say.

98
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,730
No touch

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,850
OK

100
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,550
No touch

101
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,230
no

102
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,290
Really

103
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,650
What are you doing? Let me go.

104
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,820
Damn

105
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,650
Really

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,830
Everyone said No touch

107
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,190
Why do you still want to commit suicide?

108
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,580
Are you looking for death?

109
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,070
How dare you touch me?

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,620
I understand your anger.

111
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,330
I committed an unforgivable crime.

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,130
Incurred an unpayable debt

113
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Any language is just an excuse

114
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,630
But you really misunderstood.

115
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,100
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm not interested in your suffering.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,310
Listen to me, even if it's just an excuse.

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,200
I told you not to listen to your excuses.

119
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,680
Get out of my way

120
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,360
no

121
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,530
We all agreed to No touch

122
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,590
I won't ignore you

123
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,900
You now

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,700
Do you know what No touch means?

125
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,660
I know

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,560
I remember everything you said clearly.

127
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,790
No touch

128
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,410
Live happily and joyfully

129
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,550
You must survive the temple

130
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,920
You missed the most important part.

131
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,950
respective

132
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,930
You go your way

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
I walk my own single-plank bridge

134
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,880
Living is not the point

135
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,460
The point is whether each is good or not

136
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,860
I will do my best No touch

137
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,780
I will find a happy ending for you and me

138
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,920
don't want

139
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,610
I don't want to do No touch

140
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,170
Why is this

141
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,530
What I said about No touch is completely different from what you said

142
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,810
The result of that little difference

143
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,430
But the difference between extremes

144
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,840
No

145
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll prove it to you.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,840
So let's not touch

147
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,790
No, no, no touch

148
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
No touch

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,140
Damn

150
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,690
(Episode 6: Between Understanding and Misunderstanding)

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,430
MILF

152
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,110
Your Highness

153
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,900
What is going on?

154
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,600
Go tell Shangshan

155
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,860
I'm fine

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,520
Hurry and bring the nave back

157
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,650
It's your highness

158
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,640
Niangniang

159
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,540
quick

160
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,100
(Zhang Fenghuan visited here)

161
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,570
I miss you so much

162
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,150
I miss you too

163
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,390
Are you in there?

164
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,670
It's Dad

165
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,820
The clothes have been changed.

166
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,520
You slept well last night

167
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,800
good

168
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,500
Today is your first day in the palace.

169
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,160
I woke up early

170
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,850
The child will try his best

171
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,820
Don't bring trouble to your father's reputation and family

172
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,630
Fortunately, the rain stopped and there won't be too many difficulties on the road.

173
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,470
Come out quickly and get ready

174
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,380
yes

175
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,750
I almost suffocated to death just now

176
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,550
If Zhezong hadn't rescued me

177
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,960
I almost died.

178
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,990
Why hasn't this woman come back yet?

179
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
You and His Majesty

180
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,100
What happened?

181
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,200
Run to the pond in the early morning

182
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,950
Why are you still being lazy?

183
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,860
All... all wiped

184
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm watching so closely.

185
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
When did you go out?

186
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,070
Could it be

187
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,270
Did you jump into the pond again?

188
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,210
It's not what you think.

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,890
Niangniang

190
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,520
Here are some clothes for you to change into.

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
Why are you wet again?

192
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,420
only

193
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,000
I haven't seen a pond full of water for a long time.

194
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,260
So happy for a moment

195
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,190
So I jumped in and played in the water.

196
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,580
What

197
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,170
Did you two go water play?

198
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,640
Absolutely not

199
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,170
What to do if you have a cold

200
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,030
Could it be

201
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,790
The pond is not the way back.

202
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,430
impossible

203
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,230
Your Highness

204
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,550
You are here

205
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,460
I searched the entire palace looking for you

206
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,310
What's the hurry?

207
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,540
No, you're soaked.

208
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,170
nothing

209
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,850
no

210
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,570
My sinful life

211
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,360
Only with the help of the lady can you have your own life

212
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,840
sorry

213
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,480
I didn't see you

214
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,140
Did you really not see it?

215
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,460
Those who know too many secrets will not die well.

216
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,500
That's the rule here.

217
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,920
I can't die

218
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,270
Miss, let me live well.

219
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,950
Early morning queen

220
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,500
Falling into the water again

221
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,510
However, this time

222
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,810
And His Majesty

223
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,510
I don't know why the two of them fell into the water together.

224
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,170
No one knows

225
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,280
Does this prove

226
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,020
Small ones are still useful.

227
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,590
Go tell the Queen about this.

228
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,060
The whereabouts of the Queen

229
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,990
How to report?

230
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,990
After telling her

231
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,910
She needs to tell me her reaction.

232
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,130
Don't judge your own usefulness.

233
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,000
Little one understands

234
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,010
You will take care of the Queen's daily life in the future.

235
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,760
Smell Shang Gong's subordinates work

236
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,090
Smell?

237
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,910
The monthly salary is so high

238
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,930
Thank you, sir.

239
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,220
The Queen will also think you are useful.

240
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,220
The whereabouts of the Queen Mother must also be close by

241
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,570
Keep a close watch

242
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,630
It's a small one, you can use it at your will.

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,190
Flowers are better?

244
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,230
Or buds are better?

245
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,380
What do you think, Hongyue?

246
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,560
Now I really

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,400
Only His Highness is left.

248
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,830
Concubine Yi

249
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,090
The Queen Consort has arrived

250
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,390
You are here, Queen Consort.

251
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,710
Are you painting orchids?

252
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,000
Is the painting done?

253
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,530
not yet

254
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,450
I'm still thinking about painting flowers.

255
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,960
Or painting flower buds

256
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,250
Let me see

257
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,290
I think the buds are better.

258
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,970
What flowers will bloom from the buds?

259
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,430
It will make people curious and expectant.

260
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,590
Oh, it's so beautiful.

261
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,470
It must bloom on schedule

262
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,930
Don't wither before you bloom

263
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,020
By the way, today I come

264
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,450
There's a little gift for you.

265
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,910
I am terrified

266
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,420
I don't know what you like.

267
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,630
Worrying makes it late

268
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,340
I heard you are good at archery.

269
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,960
I want to learn from you too.

270
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,680
So I prepared this gift

271
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,600
What a beautiful and strong arrow.

272
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,820
Thank you, Queen Consort

273
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,370
This isn't really a gift.

274
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,900
The real meeting will be held by His Highness

275
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,760
In today's imperial meeting

276
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,770
Delivered to you personally

277
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,050
If it's not a pond, then what is it?

278
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,940
The only thing they have in common is water.

279
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,420
There is another

280
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,630
We all have one foot in the gate of hell

281
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,300
But when I tried

282
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,390
What if I really die?

283
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,980
Death is painful.

284
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,170
There is definitely a safe and comfortable way

285
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,140
first

286
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,650
I have to understand this woman first.

287
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,380
I am

288
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,990
Kim So-yong

289
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,940
I committed suicide

290
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,400
Give up the false self

291
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,630
Give up the false self

292
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,260
Why commit suicide?

293
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,710
Because I want to survive

294
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,720
So of course I won't be back.

295
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,540
This woman

296
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,590
It turned out that he ran away from home

297
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,940
I understand now

298
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,410
You are so obsessed with the pond.

299
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,350
I like talking to myself.

300
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,290
Madam, you now

301
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,480
You're trying to regain your memory, right?

302
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,410
Yeah, that's right

303
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,080
that

304
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,340
so

305
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,020
After I fell into the lake

306
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,990
Although he was rescued immediately

307
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,420
But he didn't regain consciousness, did he?

308
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,220
Yes

309
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,210
It turned out to be running away from home

310
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,940
How can this be?

311
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,940
I really want to go back

312
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,530
Isn't this kidnapping?

313
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
A daughter-in-law who runs away from home is a lowly

314
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,630
The soul without body is noble

315
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,920
That is to say

316
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,340
Yes, it's time to do some magic

317
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,530
Use the most expensive spell

318
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,610
Choi Sang-Gong, are you there?

319
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,610
Is there anything in the palace?

320
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,010
Specializes in making shaman dances and spells

321
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,930
What

322
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,310
You absolutely can't do this.

323
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,330
But you'll still do it, right?

324
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,020
There are people like that

325
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,320
Then what

326
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,270
What does this girl want to know?

327
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,390
Here again

328
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,330
How did you get here?

329
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,170
I heard you are good at this.

330
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,670
Me?

331
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,250
What

332
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,150
Because I need spiritual faith

333
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,110
Should I say it's a shaman dance or a spell?

334
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,710
She found me for her

335
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,380
Did you recast the curse spell?

336
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,860
Oh, really.

337
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,140
Where do you want to use it?

338
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,890
Nothing else

339
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,590
Just want to recruit back

340
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,490
Soul leaving the body

341
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,300
Doesn't this happen occasionally?

342
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,920
Pretend to create some consensus naturally

343
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,230
Want to use my talisman as a leverage

344
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,760
Vixen

345
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,590
I don't believe in such things

346
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,380
It's about ghosts and spirits and stuff like that.

347
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,260
So

348
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,030
This is where what is done

349
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,200
It seems you misunderstood

350
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,440
This is not the place you mentioned.

351
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,060
This is a place for spiritual cultivation

352
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah

353
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,360
But whose soul do you want to recruit?

354
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,110
I don't know if it's because I have a very close relationship with him.

355
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,860
Still a tangled relationship

356
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,620
That's right

357
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,210
Don't misunderstand this lady.

358
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,640
Yeah

359
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,840
It turns out that

360
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,640
The mother you have never met

361
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,240
Oh, how pitiful and heartbreaking.

362
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,600
The time in the palace is lonely again

363
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,120
Still missing my deceased mother

364
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,470
so

365
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,730
Do you want to commit suicide?

366
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,560
is that so

367
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,930
You can tell me everything

368
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,540
Although the Lord is not my biological son

369
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,720
In terms of status, I am his mother.

370
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,020
From now on I will treat Namah as my daughter

371
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,300
Will be fine

372
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,030
Now there are two mothers.

373
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,410
But actually

374
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,900
I don't want to commit suicide at all.

375
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,960
So why

376
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,090
They say you want to commit suicide

377
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,820
That's right

378
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,860
Why did I do that?

379
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,570
Are you asking me to guess?

380
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,300
It means she has other intentions.

381
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,140
Why

382
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,340
So she's threatening me to stay alert?

383
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,100
Why

384
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,210
It really can't help me at all.

385
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,450
The imperial meeting is still going on

386
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,660
You're here to threaten me so soon.

387
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,100
Han Shang Gong

388
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,240
There seems to be

389
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,100
The bird that brought them the message

390
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,010
What

391
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,160
Who is it?

392
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,530
Seeing her deliberately reveal information so confidently

393
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,210
It should be an unexpected person

394
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,610
Call the shopkeeper, Han Shanggong

395
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,580
Always feel

396
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,630
I have to tell my fortune.

397
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,190
Because something painful happened

398
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,370
So he committed suicide

399
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,360
But the body is not dead.

400
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,780
So the soul is out of the body

401
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,280
besides

402
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,530
Not back yet

403
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,840
What is so painful?

404
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,230
According to what the Queen Mother said

405
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,390
She doesn't want to be a middle-ranking official.

406
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,230
Why don't you want to?

407
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,670
Because Zhezong doesn't like himself

408
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,490
Are you madly in love with another woman?

409
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,150
No way

410
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,410
Is it because of people like that that you don't want to die?

411
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,440
The queen talked to herself a lot today.

412
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,080
There are many eyes and ears.

413
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,070
What's so great about talking to yourself?

414
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,050
Talking to her is also my obsession

415
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,420
It won't be long before an evil spirit arises.

416
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,020
Too

417
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,850
I know it only after I experienced it

418
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,710
The nave is like a prison without bars.

419
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,740
The main hall of a scholar-official family during the Joseon Dynasty

420
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,310
I haven't seen many men in my life.

421
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,810
Living a life isolated from the world

422
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,150
Then I met Cheoljong

423
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,770
Plus he's the king so it was love at first sight.

424
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,980
This is understandable

425
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,620
That is to say, this woman

426
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,930
Now that's totally crazy.

427
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,280
Living in such abstinence

428
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,980
Experienced the New World

429
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,510
This woman

430
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,910
I won't use my body

431
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,260
Do something you shouldn't do.

432
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,420
stop

433
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,070
Come back soon

434
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,890
I won't let you go

435
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,040
Aren't you coming back yet?

436
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,540
What interesting things are you watching?

437
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,510
Then I will directly

438
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,280
Stabbed in

439
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,880
I want to stab until I bleed

440
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,520
It's gonna be painful.

441
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,880
Do you think I don't dare to stab?

442
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,900
Then I stabbed

443
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,600
Start stabbing

444
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,450
Damn it hurts

445
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,540
Damn

446
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,250
This time I must stab until it bleeds.

447
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,030
Ouch, it hurts, my lady.

448
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,950
It hurts so much

449
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,980
what to do

450
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,270
it hurts

451
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,400
This is my limit so far.

452
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,830
return

453
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,920
Not coming back

454
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,870
return

455
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,110
Not coming back

456
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,800
Do you want it again?

457
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,900
Niangniang

458
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,140
Don't worry

459
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,800
It will definitely come when it's time.

460
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,110
By then I had already...

461
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,140
Pen Fairy Pen Fairy

462
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
Are you here?

463
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,400
Pen Fairy Pen Fairy

464
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,710
Are you here?

465
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,790
We all share a body.

466
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,980
Let's talk openly and honestly

467
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,520
Talking to yourself again

468
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,870
It should be called a self-made shaman dance

469
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,970
Or should it be called a dialogue with oneself?

470
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,720
What if there are strange rumors?

471
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,560
Rumors spread quickly in the palace.

472
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,530
What is that? It looks good.

473
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,790
His Majesty said this is a reward.

474
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,940
So I brought it back

475
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,040
There seems to be something in it

476
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,770
Oh my god, so beautiful

477
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,230
(No Touch)
Oh my god, so beautiful

478
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,270
(No Touch)

479
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,430
Damn this damn No touch

480
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,010
When I asked for it, I kept saying no

481
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,330
But now

482
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,200
Do you have a cold?

483
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,840
I knew this would happen.

484
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,200
Playing in the rain

485
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,090
Because of my queen, I am so worried

486
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,030
Lian'er, this is not a cold.

487
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,310
What is that

488
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,840
This is

489
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,770
The disease of despair

490
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,220
I thought the lake was filled with water

491
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,750
All problems can be solved

492
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,520
Hope is

493
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,340
Such a cruel thing

494
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,770
To restore memory

495
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,920
Have you ever thought about jumping into the gods?

496
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,720
I hope the queen won't work so hard

497
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
If there are many good memories

498
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,750
Why do you want to commit suicide?

499
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,370
For your happiness, ma'am

500
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,900
It is possible that the memory cannot be restored.

501
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,890
This won't work

502
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,320
Need to restore memory

503
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,380
I can't live like this

504
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,210
I asked the imperial kitchen to prepare food.

505
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,900
Have a good rest after eating.

506
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,700
No

507
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,700
I will definitely let this woman

508
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,910
I came back with the white flag

509
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,160
Definitely

510
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,530
Hum

511
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,870
snort

512
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,310
I'm an adult, what am I doing?

513
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,490
I'm not a fool.

514
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,120
One more time

515
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,100
Hum

516
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,640
Take it away

517
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,440
yes

518
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,200
Your Highness

519
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,460
You seem to have a cold. Please go back.

520
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,910
This is not a cold

521
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,260
This is just

522
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,640
It's a cold. Shangshan is right.

523
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,890
Is there still no news from the Dazao Temple?

524
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes

525
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,990
Has the book been delivered safely?

526
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,360
Yes

527
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,020
It's hard to open your heart again

528
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,210
This is as it should be

529
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,480
There is one more thing I want to ask of you

530
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,880
Help me find something very precious.

531
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,640
Precious things

532
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,940
What are you thinking about?

533
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,900
Appointed Kim Byeong-in as the first-rank criminal judge of the Uigyeongbu

534
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,300
I have high hopes for you.

535
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,510
Holy Grace

536
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,280
I heard that you are the youngest to pass the imperial examination

537
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,540
He is also an extraordinary martial artist, so everyone knows him.

538
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,690
Such a talented person with both literary and martial skills

539
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,550
Until now, I have been unwilling to accept any official position

540
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,100
Everyone is curious about the reason

541
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,680
Is there any special reason this time?

542
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,310
Help the poor and stabilize the situation

543
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,580
(When facing a crisis, you need support to stabilize it)

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,220

(When facing a crisis, you need support to stabilize it)

548
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,490
Want to support and instruct stability

549
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,870
That's why I came

550
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,840
Crisis?

551
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,670
Oh my god

552
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,100
The ministers hid it from me because they were afraid that I would worry.

553
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,240
Is it the Qing Dynasty or the Japanese pirates this time?

554
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,850
Compared with external crises

555
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,060
What is even more dangerous is

556
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,710
Internal crisis

557
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,390
An internal crisis that had never occurred before

558
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,860
that is

559
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,590
I accidentally caught a cold

560
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,280
Health management is also a virtue of a gentleman

561
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,490
After eating this, you need to go back and rest.

562
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,210
don't want

563
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,580
Cold wind will make colds more serious

564
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,720
I want to abuse my body

565
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,810
It's not my body anyway.

566
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,210
I will never let her eat enough

567
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,800
Give me again

568
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,600
Niangniang

569
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,270
Such torture to the body

570
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,830
Can I restore my memory?

571
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,020
This will only make the Queen more miserable.

572
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,160
You keep saying this isn't your body.

573
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,610
Even without memory

574
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,300
Your body is your own.

575
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,770
If it hurts, who will feel the pain?

576
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,990
It's you, my lady.

577
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,160
Even without restoring memory

578
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,690
My lady, you can be happy too.

579
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,760
Look how nice the weather is.

580
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,410
yes

581
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,560
A sky without dust

582
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,760
Floating in with the wind

583
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,210
Fresh taste

584
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,670
Korean dining table for three meals a day

585
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,880
This is happiness enough.

586
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,530
Yeah, very happy.

587
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,390
That's right

588
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,280
Are you crying, ma'am?

589
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,330
I'm really happy without you crying

590
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:27,920
Just like you said

591
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm going to try to live here peacefully.

592
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,380
Unable to recover memory

593
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,140
Are you that sad?

594
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,120
Including dozens of my loyal subjects

595
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,090
Because I am worried about the Queen's health

596
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,000
The petition just submitted

597
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,580
What is this

598
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,480
Are you talking about abolishing the nave?

599
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,700
Because the Queen Mother habitually attempted suicide

600
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,720
In order to correct the unhealthy atmosphere of the inner women

601
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,200
Petition for dethronement

602
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,450
nave

603
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,160
In order to protect the concubine

604
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,230
I just said something false

605
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,440
After falling into the lake, he went crazy

606
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,480
Treat yourself as someone else

607
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,050
Whenever you see water, you jump in and try to commit suicide.

608
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,280
Rumors continue

609
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,840
If you believe the rumors

610
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,480
The rumor that the Empress Dowager Cijia pushed the Queen down

611
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,210
It is indeed true.

612
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,350
What

613
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,830
quiet

614
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
This letter

615
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,720
Because of the miscommunication, I ignored it.

616
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,300
Please follow the

617
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,980
The formal procedure is written but

618
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,160
As the closest person to the nave, I promise

619
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,980
The nave is not crazy

620
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,360
But

621
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,950
Everyone is too excited

622
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,280
How does today's imperial meeting end here?

623
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,450
OK

624
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,850
Niangniang

625
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,440
What's up cousin?

626
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,020
I heard you were here

627
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,870
information

628
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,380
Have you heard?

629
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,290
What

630
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,350
His Majesty has arrived

631
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,320
nave

632
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,570
It's here so soon

633
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,180
Your Highness is slow.

634
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,190
I thought I was sensitive.

635
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,590
As expected, the Imperial Guards have a lot of complaints against me.

636
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,210
Is it the matter of the Yijinfu?

637
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,110
Your Highness

638
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,350
To save the woman he loves

639
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,880
Using the nave as an excuse in front of everyone

640
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,940
You can imagine how the queen is usually treated.

641
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,710
Is this a reason to commit suicide?

642
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,890
I don't know

643
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,060
In the end, the queen wanted to save the emperor

644
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,940
In such a dangerous situation

645
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,790
What are you going to do?

646
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,000
Dangerous situation?

647
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,350
I will never let the middle temple be like that.

648
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,640
How to say

649
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,780
What method does Your Highness use?

650
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,270
This tone of voice crosses the line

651
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,360
He is the cousin of the middle temple.

652
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,130
Or as the adopted son of Master Jin Zuogen?

653
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,690
Since His Highness has no power to protect

654
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,230
I'm telling you calmly

655
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,670
No power

656
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,010
I admit

657
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,170
but

658
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,210
Force does not necessarily lead to victory

659
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,760
There are also gentle ways to deal with it

660
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,910
Need softer words

661
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,140
I will do this.

662
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,190
If it is to protect the nave

663
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,410
No matter how gentle, anyone can do it

664
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,450
There is no need to do this

665
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,140
I will protect the Queen

666
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,480
Use stronger methods to defeat faster

667
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,950
Okay, what's the reason for this?

668
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,840
It seems to be my problem

669
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,760
Why are we the only ones left here making trouble?

670
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,680
What's wrong with me

671
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,300
What's going on?

672
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,660
The petition urging the abdication of the Grand Chamberlain was submitted.

673
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,100
Damn, now I have to decide to live a good life

674
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,050
Some time ago, I wished I was dead

675
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,400
Now you want to abolish my position

676
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,760
Who said dethronement?

677
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,860
The Queen Mother was angry

678
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,060
I will say it well.

679
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,660
I have a good idea too.

680
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,040
Really

681
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,330
It seems that the middle palace has also caught a cold.

682
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,120
Are you too?

683
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,990
No matter how urgent the matter is

684
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,460
It's better to go into the middle hall and rest quickly.

685
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,040
If you have nothing else to do, please stay away from the Ijinfu affairs.

686
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,440
There is something to talk about between husband and wife

687
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,880
I have something to say to His Highness. I'll be waiting.

688
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,800
I'll see you again

689
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,750
Um

690
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,620
I wanted to wait for the reply from the middle palace.

691
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,270
But there is no time like this

692
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,420
From this moment on, I am

693
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,090
No touch

694
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,710
What are you saying No touch at this time?

695
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,850
If the palace is unwilling

696
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,180
Even if I am the only one doing it

697
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,680
No touch

698
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,660
You misunderstood the meaning.

699
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,810
Please give me your hand

700
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,860
do what

701
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,010
Why this?

702
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,300
My life

703
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,100
It has always been in the hands of your family.

704
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,540
Because this reality is blinded

705
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,880
You are also an innocent person struggling in reality

706
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,300
I didn't notice

707
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,820
I'm sorry I found out too late.

708
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,300
Give me another chance.

709
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,590
Let me have no other prejudices

710
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,140
Can just treat you as a person

711
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,320
The opportunity to understand

712
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,270
How did it come to this?

713
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,890
I know you hate this.

714
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,070
but

715
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,920
This is something that requires a formal apology.

716
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,950
Whatever you want

717
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,780
OK

718
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,730
Do it. No touch

719
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,610
I'm not worried about anyone's situation now.

720
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,400
So

721
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,560
Today is the first day

722
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,600
What

723
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,590
The first day we decided to No Touch

724
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,730
Don't say that kind of thing

725
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,720
Why

726
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,550
Just don't say

727
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,750
Don't say that again

728
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,800
What's wrong with this sentence?

729
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,070
Today is the first day

730
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,150
I told you to stop talking

731
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,540
no

732
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,220
Today is the first day...

733
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,850
Don't say it

734
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,510
You know what's going on now, right?

735
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,040
no

736
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,470
Today is the first day...

737
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,580
Don't say you're sick of it.

738
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,220
Day 1...

739
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,080
Don't say

740
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,640
Day 1...

741
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,430
Don't say

742
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,830
So

743
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,430
Since we have decided to No Touch

744
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,660
I will do everything I can for the sake of the palace.

745
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:31,810
Right?

746
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,400
This isn't the time for me.

747
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,550
I'm leaving first

748
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:36,890
no

749
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,510
Don't run, don't...

750
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,150
Will get hurt

751
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,930
Please speak

752
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,470
If you make your mother unhappy

753
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,460
Your Highness will also become unfortunate

754
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,170
Is it a threat?

755
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,620
It's worrying

756
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,500
Cousin of the Middle Temple

757
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,010
It seems that I have been too fond of the central nave.

758
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,470
Your Highness was too negligent.

759
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,970
Even though I am a powerless king

760
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,360
But there are still etiquette in the palace

761
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,930
If I cross the line again,

762
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,940
I will make a fuss about the behavior of the Yijinfu

763
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,230
Please write an article

764
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,270
Will let you write

765
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,270
A very long reflection

766
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,120
Very long

767
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,200
It takes all night.

768
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,140
Your hands will hurt.

769
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,860
Do you really think you can be deposed?

770
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,370
Through the petition

771
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,340
That should be the center.

772
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,460
Want to gather power?

773
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,700
Gather those who are dissatisfied with the Kim family

774
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,630
Want to enhance the effect of writing

775
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,780
The meaning is obvious

776
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:16,770
Dare

777
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,600
So bold

778
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,130
It's something that's bound to happen once in a while.

779
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,690
The King and the Concubine

780
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,210
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace Requests to See You

781
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,320
Xuan

782
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,890
It makes you upset

783
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,130
I'm really sorry

784
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,010
I think

785
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,130
It is correct to be deposed

786
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,410
But even if he was deposed

787
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,690
The Queen Mother must be the one to dethrone her.

788
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,630
If he was deposed by the Fengyang Zhao clan

789
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,830
That's not right

790
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,650
No matter how cruel

791
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,730
I also can't stand seeing people under me being bullied by others

792
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,030
It's a matter of self-esteem.

793
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,340
If I am deposed by the Fengyang Zhao family

794
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,530
This is not my defeat.

795
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,130
It was the defeat of the Anseong Jin clan.

796
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,260
People who know this

797
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,490
Did you do such a ridiculous thing?

798
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,420
Those are just rumors

799
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,500
This is for me to solve.

800
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,450
How to do it

801
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,730
Crisis is opportunity

802
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,430
If you give me some more time

803
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,530
Take this opportunity

804
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,840
Will overturn the judgment of the concubine

805
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,890
Today, after receiving the letter,

806
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,320
Speak for the Queen Mother

807
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,190
That guy Cheoljong?

808
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,880
The Queen Mother of the Central Palace came forward

809
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,300
It's not caused by these false rumors.

810
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,140
We need to teach Concubine Zhao a definite lesson.

811
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,620
Who is the owner of this palace now?

812
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,500
Are there so many bearers?

813
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
that

814
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,690
Pick some with good eloquence

815
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
It's eloquence

816
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,470
What

817
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,370
Good looks

818
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,090
He is also tall

819
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,790
Youth is a given

820
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,790
Choosing bearers

821
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,100
That's right.

822
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,520
I didn't choose a simple sedan bearer.

823
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,080
You'll be surprised after hearing this.

824
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,700
My Pick

825
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,790
That's right

826
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,110
Have you heard the rumor?

827
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:08,870
What

828
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,510
I heard that the Queen Mother wanted to commit suicide.

829
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,780
It is to save His Majesty the Lord and His Majesty the Concubine Yi.

830
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,600
To save the Lord, His Majesty and Concubine Yi, Your Majesty

831
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,740
That's why lying is suicidal.

832
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:21,840
Very hot

833
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,550
It's family

834
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,290
Your Highness

835
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,910
This is the problem.

836
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,770
therefore

837
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,080
I have fallen out of favor with the Queen Mother.

838
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,630
The Queen Mother put the knife on her neck

839
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,030
Standing on the side that cannot choose any side

840
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,950
Crossroads of Destiny

841
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,770
I want to break free

842
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,860
That's what it said

843
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,320
It turns out she's a witch.

844
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,750
According to rumors

845
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,680
I saw the paradise

846
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,150
Because I fell into the lake

847
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,910
After meeting the Jade Emperor

848
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,580
Became a fairy

849
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,780
Very good

850
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,350
My Pick

851
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,890
Not just a sedan bearer

852
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,210
A storyteller

853
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,280
It can be said that rumors spread like an infectious disease.

854
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,840
The human version of gossip

855
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:11,820
What

856
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,880
The more the rumor spreads,

857
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,610
It will become a real infectious disease

858
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,030
So that those who start it cannot be healed

859
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:18,830
quickly

860
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,360
And it will evolve in unpredictable directions

861
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,670
But if the suicide is fake

862
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:24,500
result

863
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,840
Push the lady into the lake

864
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,160
If it's not like this

865
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,320
The Queen Mother is risking her life

866
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,290
Did you save the harem that tried to kill you?

867
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,580
Oh my god!

868
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,900
I feel a little cold suddenly

869
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,660
Now really take a break.

870
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,110
No more

871
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,360
I have to carry you back by force.

872
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,690
Got it Got it

873
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,540
Choi Sang-Gong stopped talking

874
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,000
It's your turn to talk nonsense.

875
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,210
Is being long-winded the law of security?

876
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,870
but

877
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,950
Why haven't I seen Choi Sang-Gong since just now?

878
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,690
Very cold

879
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,710
Can you hold me tighter? It's so cold.

880
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,350
Niangniang

881
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,600
How can I hurt my own body?

882
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,070
Do you want to see me go crazy?

883
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,280
Do you want to play in the water with your lord? Do you want to play in the water with your lord?

884
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,370
Do you want to put the country in danger?

885
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,570
A spell?

886
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,550
Are you doing shaman dance?

887
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,230
We can't get so close to superstition.

888
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,070
That tone is absolutely unacceptable.

889
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,900
From one to ten

890
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,310
All of them are absolutely impossible

891
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,750
Even though I did this

892
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,550
I am not happy inside

893
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,460
Long-winded words

894
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,510
The lady will feel uncomfortable

895
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,290
No verbose words

896
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,390
I will feel uncomfortable

897
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,710
This matter

898
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,080
What should I do?

899
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,780
Niangniang

900
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,670
Have you heard the rumors?

901
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:02,880
What

902
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,430
There's chaos in the palace now.

903
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,190
It is said that the palace risked his life

904
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,950
I saved you who wanted to kill her.

905
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,150
Who said that?

906
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,530
It's the middle temple.

907
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,810
Her previous nickname for the witch from the other palace

908
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,560
Transformed into Buddha Fairy

909
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,320
It's totally overwhelming.

910
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,870
It's been transformed.

911
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,470
Now people

912
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,650
They will start calling you a bad girl.

913
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,190
This must have been planned from the beginning.

914
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,650
Three days ago, he came to me.

915
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,200
Come and report it openly

916
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,490
This is it

917
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,610
I will go and tell His Majesty.

918
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:43,840
Can't let her hide anymore.

919
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,740
Behind the Queen's Stand

920
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,860
Make a small move

921
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,910
It's hard to say

922
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,140
after all

923
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,560
Will His Highness believe you?

924
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,100
As long as I said

925
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,390
Your Highness will believe it.

926
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,450
Lord

927
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,130
Make the previously abolished petition effective again

928
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,300
Concubine Yi has arrived

929
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,290
Huazhen

930
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,190
I also have something to discuss with you.

931
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,820
Ready to find your

932
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,990
What you want to say is

933
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,030
This morning's meeting

934
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,320
Someone submitted a petition requesting the abolition of the Central Temple.

935
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,360
how so

936
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,190
The Nave was in danger to save us.

937
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,070
I think it's not ethical to just ignore it.

938
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,160
I want to put this in the book

939
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,550
Please ask the Minister of Personnel to handle it.

940
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,430
Are you okay?

941
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:47,110
To my father?

942
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,560
High reputation

943
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,890
And your daughter is here

944
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,950
Is it really still difficult?

945
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,680
Won't

946
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,170
I will write a letter to my father myself.

947
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,290
Thank you

948
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,350
Your Highness

949
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,710
When I came in here

950
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,390
There is something I look forward to

951
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,800
Just like what I learned at the beginning

952
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,330
I hope you can be with me

953
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,170
Forget the scary things

954
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,410
I hope to be like that by your side.

955
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,060
You have been a great comfort to me.

956
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,720
Really scared

957
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,970
The palace has not been completed yet.

958
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,170
I made you feel lonely

959
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,330
I understand this is also because there is no suitable time

960
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,680
I was short-sighted.

961
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,480
I will come to the other palace tonight

962
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,480
but

963
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,010
You have one day left to be with the Queen.

964
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,330
No need to mention that.

965
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,120
Then I'm meeting with the queen

966
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,220
After clearing the troubles

967
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,740
I will write a letter soon.

968
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,530
Good idea

969
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,960
The queen came to greet the master

970
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,640
Deeply terrified

971
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,940
The queen is taking medicine because of her illness.

972
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,780
Just fell asleep now

973
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
There is no way

974
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,770
Then I'll come back later

975
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,860
Here we come

976
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,450
It's clear that this soup will make people sleep

977
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,350
I heard that you were feeling unwell.

978
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,290
Although I am ill

979
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,650
But I don't regret keeping the friendship.

980
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,690
Is it friendship?

981
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,250
Stop standing outside like this.

982
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,710
Come in

983
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,090
Just the two of us

984
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,260
no

985
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,370
Let's talk warmly for a while

986
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,940
Sit back and relax

987
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,080
Why are you sitting so far away?

988
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,490
It makes people feel so distant

989
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,960
Come sit closer.

990
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,170
It's okay

991
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,660
I'll sit closer then.

992
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,660
I appear like a prince

993
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:03,570
Saved her life

994
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,970
That cold look should become

995
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,520
No, how could it be

996
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,240
The look has indeed changed.

997
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,860
But how come it got colder?

998
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,040
The letter will help you reject it.

999
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,430
So now

1000
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,610
I don't owe you anything.

1001
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,100
Thanks

1002
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,170
All Things

1003
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,110
I think it should be according to your intention.

1004
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,500
How is it possible?

1005
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,620
None of them are what I want.

1006
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,630
I want to bring His Highness who has gone away because of lies

1007
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,040
Use lies to get closer?

1008
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,190
What did you say?

1009
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,100
I may not be 100% authentic.

1010
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,870
But he is definitely not someone who tells lies.

1011
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,780
I expected you to make excuses.

1012
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,640
Not making excuses

1013
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,800
And I've said it several times.

1014
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,100
I really

1015
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,340
I have no interest in His Highness.

1016
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,880
I see

1017
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,120
I believe what you said.

1018
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,750
So let's strengthen our friendship tonight.

1019
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,330
Have a pajama party

1020
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,170
no

1021
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,230
Lingerie Party

1022
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,110
Tonight I will have sex with His Highness.

1023
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,550
Why

1024
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,870
Not compared to that

1025
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,230
Do I have to know this?

1026
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,710
Heartbreaking

1027
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,650
It has to be so painful

1028
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,540
Said he was not interested

1029
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,330
But your reaction is a bit exaggerated.

1030
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,090
I have no interest in Your Highness.

1031
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,850
When did I say I'm not interested in you?

1032
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,370
Please prove that your good intentions are genuine.

1033
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,830
If this time

1034
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,890
Your words and actions are still different

1035
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,260
Then I will also give my best

1036
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,340
Fight with you

1037
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,690
It's come to this.

1038
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,080
I can only give up.

1039
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,650
knew

1040
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,300
I will be neat

1041
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:00,990
Best wishes for the future to you two

1042
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,160
This is your loss.

1043
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,460
Didn't realize my charm missed me

1044
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:07,880
So goodbye.

1045
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,150
This iron wall woman

1046
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,090
What a cruel woman in the world.

1047
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,810
34

1048
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,620
What are you looking for?

1049
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,770
I feel depressed and tortured

1050
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,250
I feel uncomfortable so I came here

1051
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,540
You're in the wrong place

1052
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:06,910
Although the pain in my heart seems to be there and not there

1053
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,020
But there is no medicine for this

1054
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,530
I'm closing now.

1055
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:12,610
This way please

1056
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,450
that

1057
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,390
Come

1058
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,370
Precious items

1059
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,690
I'm talking about precious objects from the Qing Dynasty.

1060
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,580
To make this morning's meeting

1061
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,010
Let's sort out what happened

1062
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,420
I invited two

1063
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,700
He dared to propose the abolition of the Middle Temple

1064
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,220
This is a challenge to all of us in the Kim family.

1065
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,710
I don't know when

1066
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:24,120
The curse of the nave will jump into the lake

1067
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,520
By then, you won't even be able to get your money back.

1068
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,640
You said something slanderous.

1069
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,710
How dare you stir up trouble?

1070
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,120
Incitement

1071
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,990
Just to insult me

1072
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,520
Is that why you called me here?

1073
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,070
What is this doing?

1074
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,240
Are you threatening me now?

1075
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,850
This is asking you to listen to me first.

1076
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,130
Really

1077
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,340
As I mentioned before

1078
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,120
There are no losers here tonight

1079
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,020
So could you listen to me for a moment longer?

1080
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,060
Sit down

1081
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,070
I wonder if the Right Councillor still remembers this.

1082
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,850
Letter from the Queen Mother to her maternal family

1083
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,700
The place and time written in this letter

1084
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,070
Consistent with the Middle Temple injury incident

1085
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,910
This is a fake letter.

1086
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,780
Can you prove this is fake?

1087
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,860
This letter and the letter of abdication

1088
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,210
I hope these two things can change my mind

1089
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,900
The two families involved tonight

1090
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,950
No more suffering from the same problem

1091
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,340
This is what I am proposing

1092
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,430
How about it

1093
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,310
Did you call me?

1094
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,210
The letter that His Highness gave me has been completed.

1095
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,530
Can you give it to my father for me?

1096
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:02,420
I

1097
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,340
I will go and convince His Highness

1098
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,780
Your Highness is just

1099
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,430
Just wanting to give back

1100
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,640
Although the Queen's thoughts may be different

1101
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,500
but

1102
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,150
What matters to me is His Highness's heart.

1103
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,700
So it's okay.

1104
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,060
master

1105
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,380
The bath is ready

1106
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,180
Here

1107
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,640
Still no problem

1108
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,630
Concubine

1109
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,180
Did you get what you wanted?

1110
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,310
I called upon the Bodhisattva because I failed to achieve my wish.

1111
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:18,010
I feel very uneasy and anxious.

1112
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,070
Stay calm

1113
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,670
I'll give you the answer

1114
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:50,800
Now

1115
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,930
Preparing for the palace

1116
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,550
I have something to tell you

1117
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,100
Let's all go out for a while.

1118
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,700
yes

1119
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,240
The abdication of the nave is our chance

1120
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,060
How could His Highness think of stopping the abdication?

1121
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,820
Even if the palace is deposed

1122
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,820
There will only be another person to take over.

1123
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,480
The Temple is doing for us

1124
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,490
Friendly Choice

1125
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,140
Among the people standing in that position

1126
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,220
She is our best choice.

1127
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,140
Are you shaken?

1128
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,400
Please answer me

1129
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,710
Are you shaken?

1130
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:36,270
yes

1131
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,700
I am shaken

1132
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,630
She saved him regardless of herself.

1133
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,300
Want to kill her husband

1134
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,310
And the husband's woman

1135
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,930
It's not about ignoring it as if it didn't happen.

1136
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,270
It's not that I forgive you for doing it.

1137
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:49,400
I really can't ignore

1138
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,680
This kind of sincerity is like this

1139
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,490
Don't expect my apology

1140
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,840
No thanks from me

1141
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,600
I just kept my friendship silently.

1142
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,490
For the nave in crisis

1143
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,080
How can I not be shaken?

1144
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,100
Are you going to betray Yipin?

1145
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,640
Betray us?

1146
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,440
This is not the way to treat friends.

1147
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,280
Nor should we treat the Central Temple unreasonably.

1148
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,530
Do this

1149
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,730
It's not a betrayal to anyone.

1150
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,770
The danger is

1151
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,370
Good feeling

1152
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,320
His Highness's favorable opinion of the Middle Temple

1153
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,470
It will clearly become your weakness

1154
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,780
I won't let it turn out like this

1155
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,550
I see

1156
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,570
Then let's agree on one thing.

1157
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,930
If the attitude and position of the Middle Temple changes

1158
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:39,160
or

1159
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,600
We have discovered a hostile existence.

1160
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,020
Then I will not hesitate

1161
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:52,300
Did you take the life of the middle temple?

1162
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,200
Is there no way to answer?

1163
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:25,530
If we are sure that the Nave is our enemy

1164
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,780
I will chop off her head myself

1165
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,110
I feel my strength has increased.

1166
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,470
Is this really made by hand?

1167
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:59,700
There are no North Korean women who can't even embroider.

1168
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,460
Yes

1169
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:07,070
There is no rule that women must be able to embroider

1170
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,550
You really can't do it.

1171
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:10,580
Very strong too

1172
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,680
I am the weak one among the slaves.

1173
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,870
People say I look like a violet.

1174
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,360
In the Joseon Dynasty, this

1175
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:23,930
Take a look

1176
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:26,650
Pull apart

1177
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,120
(The descendants of takeaway sail out)

1178
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,290
Post this in the yard.

1179
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,890
Then it can be officially opened for business

1180
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,270
Do you want to charge a delivery fee?

1181
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,030
I just need some money.

1182
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:50,160
The queen brought the precious orchid

1183
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,110
Wind orchid

1184
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,170
How do you know I made a sail?

1185
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,130
A flower basket was also sent

1186
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,990
(In Memory of No Touch)

1187
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,370
It was sent by His Highness himself.

1188
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,910
Bad Guy

1189
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,970
I'm trying to forget.

1190
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,060
Is this showing off or something?

1191
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,780
I am a hundred times stronger than him.

1192
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,410
For example, now it is so great

1193
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,420
Creating job opportunities that the capital cannot achieve

1194
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,320
In the Joseon era, there was no such convenience.

1195
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,050
Invented such an amazing thing

1196
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,310
Is it because I am too good and feel burdened?

1197
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,870
Yeah, I can do that too.

1198
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,660
I've heard too much nonsense.

1199
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:43,900
No appetite?

1200
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,760
How come there is no taste at all?

1201
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,520
Wait a moment

1202
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,010
North Korea has no convenience at all

1203
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,300
As long as I do something

1204
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,600
The first one in North Korea

1205
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,160
Not the first in the world

1206
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,320
Suddenly I had the desire to survive

1207
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,120
Here I am Edison

1208
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,600
Am I Steve Jobs?

1209
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,390
Isn't there anyone more amazing?

1210
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,320
The great man who saved humanity

1211
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,790
She has taken up residence in her body

1212
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:08,960
Things that shouldn't be accommodated

1213
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:17,310
The monster is a monster.

1214
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,440
You can't just leave it like this.

1215
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:31,980
World world what's going on

1216
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,540
Founder of Carrier Air Conditioning

1217
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,230
MILF

1218
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,940
My Lady, wake up!

1219
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:51,930
Niangniang

1220
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,720
Hey, get out of the way.

1221
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:03,100
I'm out of breath.

1222
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,590
No pulse

1223
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:30,830
(Preview of the next episode)

1224
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,810
The palace fainted

1225
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,010
Does it mean you stop breathing?

1226
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,650
If the breath comes back, you can live.

1227
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,590
If you can't come back

1228
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,790
Is the hospital back?

1229
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,570
I'm here to confirm what kind of person His Highness is.

1230
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,650
That look

1231
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,060
Is it a look of repression or hiding one's true heart?

1232
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,520
Clear Start

1233
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,020
nave

1234
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,240
From now on, the Imperial Guard will investigate.

1235
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,700
Stop, that's my woman.
