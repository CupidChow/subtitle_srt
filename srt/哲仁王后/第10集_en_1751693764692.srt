00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,670
(This drama is purely fictional characters, groups, events, etc.
None of which is relevant to history)

2
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Hua Zhen

3
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,590
Hua Zhen

4
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,230
What are you doing there?

5
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll go call someone

6
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,810
no

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,960
Can't let anyone know

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,790
I'm here

9
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,070
Anyone Anyone

10
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,970
oops

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,270
(Episode 10)

12
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,240
Any good memories there?

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,650
How did you go there?

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,990
Do you really not need to call someone over?

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
This won't really cause any deaths, right?

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,210
Are you having nightmares again?

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,910
Hey, wake up.

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,500
Huahuazhen

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,200
yes

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,660
Whatever you think

21
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,572
This won't work. I'll go call someone.

22
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:43,742
oops

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,232
You are here again

24
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,052
Had a terrible dream

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,320
Until death is an incompetent king

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,070
Couldn't do anything

27
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,460
Just watching the world slowly being destroyed

28
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,180
A terrible dream of dying just like that

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,950
Who said anything?

30
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,390
Just a moment

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,930
Just stay like this

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,120
Just a moment

33
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,240
One minute then

34
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,530
I will be your Zhao Huazhen

35
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,210
(Episode 10: Living in a Nightmare)

36
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,730
You really became the Queen Mother.

37
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,260
I knew you would be chosen.

38
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,800
I want to tell His Highness the truth

39
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,730
Can't be controlled by the past anymore

40
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,790
Niangniang

41
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,470
I have something to say to His Highness.

42
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,840
His Highness and His Majesty went out.

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,260
The father-in-law is not at home either.

44
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,950
originally

45
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,640
Not only can it help His Highness, but it can also bring down the Central Palace.

46
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,070
What to do

47
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,880
Niangniang

48
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,480
It's time to wash up

49
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,700
oops

50
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,500
Are you awake?

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,260
What's going on?

52
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,130
That's right

53
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,700
I almost touched it.

54
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
Almost died

55
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,620
I don't know how much you weigh.

56
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,760
Really dangerous

57
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,820
No account books

58
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,000
Did you save me?

59
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,510
Just you

60
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,110
Didn't you say you can't let anyone know?

61
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,410
I really used the power of my soul

62
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,760
I can

63
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,910
There was a record of carrying 150 kg

64
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,410
Strength does not come from muscles

65
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,150
But from the will and the soul

66
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,300
Why

67
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,220
Why go to the well in the middle of the night?

68
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,570
that

69
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,370
It was too dark so I didn't see a well.

70
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,130
Just fell down like that

71
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,750
Is it night blindness?

72
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,030
How did you fall into a well that is hard to climb out of?

73
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,110
Are you up?

74
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,430
Wait a moment

75
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,640
Wait a moment

76
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,970
Okay, please come in.

77
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,770
oops

78
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,220
oops

79
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,650
If I had known you were going to live in the main house

80
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,480
I should prepare a bigger quilt.

81
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,830
Dad, please.

82
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,250
Dad, no, Dad, Dad

83
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,670
Dad, I can't.

84
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,850
dad

85
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,450
Fear

86
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,590
You are serious.

87
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,740
Thanks to the father-in-law, you were very comfortable during this period.

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,870
I can't bother you anymore. I plan to go back to the palace today.

89
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,830
What's bothering me? Don't say that.

90
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,140
I am also telling you what the Queen Mother said.

91
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,570
The Queen Mother is looking for you

92
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,030
You to her

93
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,810
It's really important

94
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,020
That?

95
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,050
Because I'm not in the palace, it's a mess

96
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,950
yes

97
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,830
No matter how hard and tiring it is

98
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,000
That's good.

99
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,130
Don't worry about anything

100
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,050
Just make the central hall.

101
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,270
Although I have many shortcomings as a father

102
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,680
Don't forget I'm behind you

103
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,360
OK

104
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Slow down, Your Highness

105
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,460
I know it's a bit shameless to say this

106
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,170
We entrust our Queen Mother to you.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In order not to make the nave feel lonely

108
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,950
I will work harder

109
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,220
oops

110
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,940
I am terrified

111
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,400
Let's go

112
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,190
Although I pretend to be the most loving father in the world

113
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,470
In fact, they are greedy people who treat their children as props.

114
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,120
Even let his daughter

115
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,710
Marry someone who wants to kill you

116
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,090
Is that why he wanted to kill Kim So Rong?

117
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,810
Why do you look like you've lost your country again?

118
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,630
No

119
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,310
If it's not the country, then what else has been lost?

120
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,410
Oh, is it true?

121
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,670
How is it possible?

122
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,090
Today is a happy day for the Queen to return to the palace safely.

123
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,300
Although it looks like this

124
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,490
But this is already a very happy expression

125
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,100
Already used to it

126
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,930
Has the bloody revenge really begun?

127
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,420
but

128
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,790
I feel like I've lost something very important.

129
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,410
I always feel that there is a very important task

130
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,880
Dafa is so handsome

131
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
So cool

132
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,730
That's right

133
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,890
Conferring the title of harem

134
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,170
I forgot such an important thing.

135
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
I have something important to do. I'm leaving now.

136
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,630
Hurry up and go

137
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,670
I said

138
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,850
Why run?

139
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,970
sorry

140
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,270
Walk slower.

141
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,970
Oh, really.

142
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,080
nave

143
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,680
Your Highness

144
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,410
Let's go back first.

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,370
Where is Shangshan?

146
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,580
Already caught

147
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,580
Can't find it?

148
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,370
Disappeared

149
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,690
Did the father-in-law find out and move it?

150
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,210
That's not the case

151
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,310
When I left

152
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,960
There's no change in attitude.

153
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,340
The father-in-law can't hide his emotions

154
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,190
Is that the person?

155
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,370
The Masked Imperial Guard

156
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,250
If it has fallen into Jin Zuogen's hands

157
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,490
The account book should no longer exist.

158
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,680
He couldn't possibly know the new hiding place.

159
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,660
That's the problematic thing.

160
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,150
The father-in-law couldn't possibly tell anyone that it was lost.

161
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,440
A person is anxious there

162
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,250
but

163
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,840
Will you find the whereabouts of the account book?

164
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,640
He will take action himself

165
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,320
Send someone to follow the father-in-law.

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,110
yes

167
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,100
The ledger has disappeared

168
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,300
Just give up on this.

169
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,080
If there is no

170
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,950
All our plans have gone to waste.

171
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,110
Can't give up so easily

172
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,060
Just be polite as before

173
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,920
Come quickly, come quickly, go over there

174
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,740
Niangniang

175
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,590
Hello Choi Sang-Gong

176
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
Niangniang

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,850
I miss you so much

178
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,970
Choi Sang-Gong

179
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,680
You gather all the women in North Korea together.

180
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,000
besides

181
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,770
Don't lose any of the Han family's genealogy

182
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,840
Find them all

183
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,920
From now on, I will confer the title of Empress

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,150
By selecting a survey account that takes its course

185
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,890
Sure enough, enthroning the harem is the correct answer

186
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,090
That's right

187
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,480
I have to pay my respects to our King and Queen.

188
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,630
Look forward to it

189
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,900
The Soul of Jang Bong-hwan

190
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,500
Merged with Kim So-yong's memories

191
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,260
The perfect nave

192
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,680
Cosplay

193
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,070
The King and the Concubine

194
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,800
I wonder if you are in good health during this period.

195
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,820
Where exactly has the change been?

196
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,310
I always feel something is different

197
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,970
I went back to my mother's home and found my original intention

198
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,380
It's a blessing

199
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,900
During this period, you feel worried and anxious

200
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,380
Always embracing and loving me

201
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,960
The Queen Mother's Heart

202
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,930
It scares me again

203
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,000
I want to undo my past mistakes

204
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,230
I will do my best to fulfill my duties as the Central Palace.

205
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,250
Let's start with the important things first.

206
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,990
I understand, I understand

207
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,020
I am here to carry out your mission.

208
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Only then would he rush back to the palace as soon as he recovered.

209
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,990
It is indeed the Central Palace.

210
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,920
I was only away for two days.

211
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,860
But that matter has always been on my mind.

212
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,760
How can you be so connected to me?

213
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,280
So

214
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,010
Now

215
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,680
immediately

216
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,290
us

217
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,930
nave

218
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,460
well done

219
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,740
That's not what I thought.

220
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,580
Niangniang

221
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,220
Please teach us more.

222
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,560
I've become hopeless.

223
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,630
Since you want to reveal your secrets

224
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,490
I am not yet good enough to teach apprentices.

225
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,370
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

226
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,190
You may be able to come in without permission.

227
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,810
But don't think about going out casually.

228
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,310
Concubine Yi

229
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,240
His Majesty has entered the palace

230
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,650
Yeah

231
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,720
Do you want to go to Seonjeongjeon right away?

232
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,580
No, I'm going to another palace.

233
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,970
The fire is too weak.

234
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,650
The food is all sticky together.

235
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,060
The flames are really coming out

236
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,870
Huh

237
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,490
I see fire in the eyes of the experienced people.

238
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,060
How come?

239
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,070
I just want to learn.

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,820
Only then will your eyes be filled with enthusiasm

241
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,500
But when will you teach me how to cook?

242
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,650
Kitchen survival rules

243
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,390
What do those who know the truth say?

244
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,840
I usually find a kitchen to study in.

245
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,540
At first, I could only peel onions.

246
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,750
Please make a good fire for me first

247
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,020
Ouch

248
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,560
That's because I've been working in the imperial kitchen for thirty years.

249
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,620
It has been twelve years since I became an expert.

250
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,420
Do you remember it in such detail?

251
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,450
Why don't you remember the exact date?

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,010
Look at your improper learning attitude

253
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,500
Forget it. I won't teach you anymore.

254
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,360
Niang Niang Niang Niang

255
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,710
Is this ok?

256
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,890
Yeah, like this.

257
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,390
so

258
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,740
Open it and see

259
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,030
Get out of the way

260
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,790
Are you peeking now?

261
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,850
Corporate espionage

262
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,630
No, I just wanted to see if the fire was just right.

263
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,990
Wait for the experienced to stop thinking

264
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Leave all the thinking to me

265
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,000
Why do you always want to cross the line?

266
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,180
If soup and rice are the soul food of the common people

267
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,550
The soul food of the two classes is beef bone soup after all.

268
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,690
And then I'm going to add the French beef recipe to this

269
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,060
Using egg white to eliminate meat odor

270
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,540
protein

271
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,700
There is such a usage

272
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,590
MILF

273
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,450
Is this enough?

274
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,220
Oh, that's good.

275
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,160
What do you want to do?

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,550
That is food that can touch the soul.

277
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,660
Soul?

278
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,770
very good

279
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,220
Then the finishing touch

280
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,340
Is it ready outside?

281
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,060
It's the queen

282
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,980
The bubble is gone and you can't stay

283
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,140
With this mood

284
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,250
Ensuring safety and speed

285
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,910
good

286
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,020
Set off

287
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,340
It's the queen

288
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,160
Get started

289
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,330
The most terrifying thing is the familiar taste

290
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,910
Niangniang

291
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,380
sandalwood

292
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,280
I was afraid that I would never see my mother again.

293
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm scared to death.

294
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,720
Really

295
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,800
Thank you so much

296
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,030
I actually made our Tan Xiang worried.

297
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,970
It seems that the queen really needs to teach herself a lesson.

298
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,800
sorry

299
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,780
this

300
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,280
Am I seeing it wrong now?

301
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,910
Is there rice in this?

302
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,080
In my opinion, it is also rice

303
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,840
Did she make soup and rice for me?

304
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,520
Imperial meals must have soup and rice served separately

305
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,960
She actually soaked the rice in the soup for me to eat

306
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,120
Do you want to return it?

307
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,080
This can...

308
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,180
yes

309
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,220
Considering the sincerity of the middle temple,

310
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,810
I'll try it first.

311
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,300
yes

312
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,020
All along

313
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,470
I count every day I spend in the imperial kitchen

314
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,520
With this confidence, I have survived till now.

315
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,530
But I actually overnight

316
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,190
Reduced to a fireman

317
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,350
This is the Queen Mother of the Central Palace

318
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,790
It's not that I'm so bad.

319
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,290
But the food in the middle hall is too good

320
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,250
Really

321
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,850
MILF

322
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,790
Damn

323
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,010
MILF

324
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,830
you also

325
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,000
you also

326
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,220
MILF

327
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,040
Damn it, you're taking it too far.

328
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,590
A young girl

329
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,620
Hey you

330
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,600
Do you think that experienced people are easy to bully?

331
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,990
It really is

332
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,120
I feel much happier.

333
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,260
Choi Sang-Gong, when are you

334
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,690
I'm not as serious as you.

335
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,870
I was really humiliated by my empress.

336
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,470
That's why I lost my mind for a while.

337
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,500
You don't have to face the stove all day long.

338
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,960
What are you doing?

339
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,740
No, that's not what I meant.

340
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,390
Are you

341
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,470
Are you

342
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,430
I

343
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,600
Don't come over here

344
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,670
All right

345
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,820
Excuse me

346
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,970
Really

347
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,760
If you say something bad about the lady again

348
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,320
I feel like I'm becoming the same person as him.

349
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,630
But the pressure in my heart has to be relieved

350
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,480
I really

351
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,300
I really want to quit.

352
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,530
There

353
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,140
How could he be there?

354
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,600
OMG

355
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Absolutely not

356
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,740
Never, never, never

357
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,280
Absolutely not.

358
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
No, no, absolutely not

359
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,130
The Queen Mother and the Queen Mother request an audience

360
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,270
Let her in

361
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,980
Finished

362
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,330
Soul food will only be useful if she has a soul.

363
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,950
Niangniang

364
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,440
I just left the imperial kitchen for a while

365
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,180
So the food seems to be a bit off.

366
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,230
This taste seems familiar

367
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,620
I don't know, but I'm so familiar with it

368
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,060
Your craftsmanship is truly horrible.

369
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,630
Even my long forgotten memories

370
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,390
I've asked you to give me the strategy.

371
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,210
Good boy

372
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,100
Mother

373
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,710
Niangniang

374
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,230
There are grains of rice on your mouth

375
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,060
presumptuous

376
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,620
But you want to keep this great technology to yourself

377
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,780
Is it not worth teaching an experienced person?

378
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,920
Um

379
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,810
I'm not really happy with him.

380
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,700
Then I killed him immediately

381
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,920
After all, there was an arsenic case before.

382
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,290
Arsenic?

383
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,950
Don't you know?

384
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,880
The reason why you become a corpse

385
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,280
It's all because of the poison in the imperial kitchen.

386
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,340
poison

387
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,750
How did I get better so quickly?

388
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,540
Although the experienced ones are a little inflexible

389
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,460
But you took his job away so suddenly

390
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,130
What Works

391
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,850
I mean cut his neck.

392
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,920
Who got the account book?

393
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,700
Than who took it

394
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,590
More importantly, why take it away?

395
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,480
Will it become our poison?

396
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,740
Or a good medicine?

397
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,790
Whether he lost his job or his life

398
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,440
What does it have to do with me?

399
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,050
She always mentions this to me.

400
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,400
It seems that it is not impossible for the Queen to be deposed.

401
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,590
How can I spare the energy to think about him now?

402
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,080
It's hard to protect myself

403
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,820
Isn't that Cheoljong over there?

404
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,050
Your Highness

405
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,030
The Queen Mother is here

406
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,190
What are you doing?

407
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,890
I heard that the women of the Wang family all walk like this

408
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,490
After all, I am also a perfect queen.

409
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,490
who

410
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,550
Who said that?

411
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,930
What did Choi Sang-Gong say?

412
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,830
Isn't it?

413
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,640
No, I mean who said you are the perfect nave.

414
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,810
As you can see, it is exactly what I said.

415
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
It's terrible

416
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,920
You should just continue as usual.

417
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,500
By the way, what does our Highness prefer?

418
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,450
Sexy, cute, pure

419
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,250
What's the meaning

420
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,210
Um

421
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,060
I am following the order of the Queen Mother

422
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,390
I want to choose a few harem for you

423
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,140
It's a harem anyway.

424
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,090
I want to consider your orientation.

425
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,490
Harem

426
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,010
Harem?

427
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,940
Look at this guy

428
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,610
Finally starting to show its true colors

429
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,510
That's a good idea.

430
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,660
Feel sorry

431
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm so happy

432
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,380
Um

433
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,900
I have something I want to explain to you.

434
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,720
Even though you are the king

435
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,910
But I advise you to throw away the harem. It's your women.

436
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,960
Such backward and primitive ideas

437
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,490
After all, the harem does not belong to you

438
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,660
You said it well

439
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,060
You mean

440
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,950
be mine

441
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,910
What

442
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,040
I said the harem is mine

443
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,720
So don't even think about coming to the harem or the other palaces.

444
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,410
Anyway, you only need one Yipin

445
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,260
good

446
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,960
but

447
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,000
I also have a condition

448
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,100
Excuse me

449
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,980
What to do

450
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,180
Nothing

451
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,470
I decide the door.

452
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,960
What

453
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,900
don't want

454
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,540
I care more about appearance than background.

455
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,460
Appearance

456
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,450
If this is true

457
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,900
I can only go to the Queen Mother

458
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,850
I strongly express that I don't need to appoint a harem

459
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,260
knew

460
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,160
but

461
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,000
We don't touch each other's field

462
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,750
I'm responsible for the appearance and you're responsible for the home

463
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,410
Zhongdian, you are indeed my anti-fan

464
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,750
I had a lot of worries.

465
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,620
But now there is a way

466
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,790
No laughing

467
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,060
No laughing

468
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,570
You are not allowed to grab my hand suddenly like you just did.

469
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,090
Don't hold me down.

470
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,600
Nothing is allowed?

471
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,430
You're right.

472
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,990
Anyway, you are not allowed

473
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,710
I shouldn't have come to talk to him.

474
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,920
Gone

475
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,430
That's the middle hall.

476
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,560
Are you going to see His Highness?

477
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,120
I want to go back to the palace

478
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,490
Is this what you're looking for?

479
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,280
Was the person who put it here a palace servant?

480
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,010
Um

481
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,130
It's a young face

482
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,040
And she was wearing palace clothes

483
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,210
Do you still remember what it looked like?

484
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,910
That depends on how much you pay.

485
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,050
I'll come back when I find someone.

486
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,060
The clearer your memory of the palace people is,

487
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,280
The price will also be higher

488
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
Come in

489
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,040
No matter how I look at it, this is bought.

490
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,140
Do you mean this is a fake identity?

491
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,270
Not a brand new forgery

492
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,470
Instead, they borrowed the household registration of a deceased or missing person.

493
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,060
If someone can do this perfectly

494
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,170
Should have paid a high price

495
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,580
Thank you very much

496
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,150
Just to become a lower-ranking warrior

497
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,110
It took so much effort

498
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,990
Your Highness, I have something to give you in private.

499
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,750
I'll wait for you at the old place.

500
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,440
Concubine Yi

501
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,330
Yongping Jun went out of the palace to do some business

502
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,580
Then please ask Gao Shanggong to personally

503
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,300
Tell His Majesty.

504
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,630
yes

505
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,390
This is her letter to His Majesty.

506
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,670
If she hadn't seen the affection between His Highness and the Queen

507
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,980
How could this happen?

508
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,540
The Imperial Conference will begin in a moment.

509
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,680
yes

510
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,780
You can take a short rest before sending it off.

511
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,950
yes

512
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,780
This is the letter from Concubine Yi to you.

513
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,050
I'm sure you ministers have been very busy while I'm away.

514
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,180
I have nothing to do after I come back.

515
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

516
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,380
For the ministers who have worked so hard

517
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,020
I want to give a banquet on Dragon Boat Festival

518
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,750
War and resentment grow

519
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,190
Rewarding the Ministers

520
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,240
People

521
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,450
They think the country doesn't care about them.

522
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,480
And hold a grand banquet

523
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,130
therefore

524
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,060
This is not what a king should do.

525
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,040
but

526
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,500
Yeongjo was also sick to celebrate and recovered after a few months.

527
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,010
There is a precedent for rewarding a banquet.

528
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,880
The nave too

529
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,070
Because I'm overworked and lack of energy during this period

530
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,720
Recovering from cadaveric syncope

531
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,630
Isn't this something worth celebrating?

532
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,410
The reason why the Queen Mother suffered from cadaver coma is still under investigation

533
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,760
Unable to determine the cause

534
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,820
I saw that she recovered after two days of treatment.

535
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,270
I just need a break.

536
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,820
but

537
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,840
Since the Queen Mother

538
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,520
Overcame the serious illness and recovered safely

539
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,920
Announcement through a small banquet

540
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,940
It is legitimate

541
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,230
That's right

542
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,580
This is the moral duty of a husband.

543
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,480
It's the king's duty.

544
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,480
Your Highness

545
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,460
This is absolutely not allowed

546
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,870
Killing the Queen is such a serious matter

547
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,330
The words that ended hastily by entering the banquet

548
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,530
Military Affairs Minister

549
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,790
Are you not happy to see the healing of the nave?

550
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,210
Could it be

551
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,060
Do you hope that someone will harm the central palace?

552
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,140
that

553
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,900
How come?

554
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,830
The military judge is more concerned about the safety of the central palace.

555
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,110
Is it more important to use this to achieve political goals?

556
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,360
Please calm down, Your Highness.

557
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,520
If you insist on doing so

558
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,390
We ministers will gratefully accept your highness's kindness.

559
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,190
So please look forward to it

560
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,350
Is it because you rested well?

561
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,190
Full of desire

562
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,640
Using barbarians to control barbarians

563
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,470
The foreigners must be forced to retreat by foreigners

564
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,860
Let's create a new force that can fight against the Anseong Jin family.

565
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,960
Manufacturing?

566
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,540
Using the harem canonization that the Zhongdian is responsible for

567
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,090
Please take a look at this if you are experienced

568
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,400
Hmm, does it taste good?

569
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,920
Where

570
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,930
Bring me some more salt.

571
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,840
This is not okay

572
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,140
That one is too thin. Redo it.

573
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,180
What are you doing so seriously?

574
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,420
after

575
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,010
Dishes made with camel cheese will be popular

576
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,980
We can't let the calves starve all the time.

577
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,920
By Not Actually Camel Cheese

578
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Can also make that taste

579
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,400
How did people make molecular cuisine in the Joseon Dynasty?

580
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,140
I'm especially serious today.

581
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,080
Waiting for experienced people

582
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,990
Feeling the face of sadness and joy

583
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,800
There must be a long queue of family members waiting for him to support them.

584
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,540
Please tell me

585
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,780
Put out the fire here.

586
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,640
With that little shoulder

587
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,690
Carrying the weight of being the head of the family alone

588
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,640
I don't even know your name.

589
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,100
May I have your name

590
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,720
My name is Wanfu

591
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,370
Who are the family members?

592
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,490
Although there must be more than 10 wives and children

593
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,540
I am alone

594
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,490
What

595
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,750
Lived alone and freely for a while

596
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,420
Even so, there are still people to feed.

597
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,140
Think about it

598
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,810
Feed fish heads to stray cats when passing by

599
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,660
That's right

600
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,900
You see

601
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,130
There is no blessing

602
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,120
Those stray cats will starve.

603
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,840
I'm not doing this for your sake.

604
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,420
But for the sake of those cats

605
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,060
Let me tell you the secret

606
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,670
Holy Grace

607
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,220
So disgusting. Why do you do this?

608
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,330
well

609
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,070
that

610
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,320
Give me the paper

611
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,690
Hong Yan

612
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,310
Tell the bearers here

613
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,330
Send to the royal doctor

614
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,160
yes

615
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,820
Recommend some medicinal herbs that are good for the skin and have a good aroma

616
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,570
If you don't do your job well, be careful of job changes.

617
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,710
Job Change

618
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,650
There seems to be something written behind it.

619
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,500
There are not enough eunuchs to help the harem to be enthroned

620
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,860
Why is there a shortage of eunuchs every month?

621
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,760
Your Highness

622
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,120
Walk slowly or you'll get hurt.

623
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,500
Where are the books related to the banquet?

624
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,580
Slave

625
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,030
Come and find it

626
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,710
I would definitely like to refer to the banquet of Yeongjo's Gapa

627
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,490
yes

628
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,270
I went to Xuanzheng Hall to look for someone.

629
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,100
I heard you were here.

630
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,540
Why are you here?

631
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,280
I think about this period of time

632
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,160
Have you neglected the Lord too much?

633
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,930
I want to talk to you

634
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,160
Please drink

635
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,210
I wonder if it's because the master brewed the tea himself.

636
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,970
The taste is more mysterious

637
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,350
Seeing the Lordâ€™s words

638
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,420
I will think of the late king

639
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,810
so

640
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,610
It's hard to get close to the Lord

641
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,580
I don't understand this feeling. I'm really scared.

642
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,790
Ai Jia

643
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,790
I think I know the late king well.

644
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,330
Maybe the former king

645
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,250
Ai's Son

646
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,490
He is a king beyond my imagination.

647
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,050
Fighting against the Kim family to establish the kingship

648
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,090
I couldn't lead my family.

649
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,660
More support for the wishes of the late king

650
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,840
Feeling very sorry

651
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,890
Please don't blame yourself

652
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,400
The former king also

653
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,150
Don't want this

654
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,230
maybe

655
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,420
Through the Lord

656
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,040
Can I undo my mistake towards the previous king?

657
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,370
I am far inferior to the previous king.

658
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,310
Yeah

659
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,730
If I had the same will as the previous king

660
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,250
Please be sure

661
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,410
Reach out to me

662
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,860
The same mistake as before

663
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,610
It will never happen again

664
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,190
My son, please remember

665
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,510
Today I seem to have a better understanding of the Lord.

666
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,760
very nice

667
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,660
It is my honor

668
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,700
Please take a rest

669
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,850
His Majesty has arrived

670
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,530
sorry

671
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,090
Have you been waiting for a long time?

672
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,280
Go out for a while

673
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,600
I thought you weren't coming.

674
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,030
I'll be back soon.

675
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,690
Because I read the letter very late

676
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,400
Looks very busy.

677
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,080
I can't even read letters.

678
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,880
actually

679
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,960
The Queen Mother found me and talked to me for a while

680
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,880
What did you talk about?

681
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,670
Just chatting

682
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,300
Your Highness

683
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,600
There are more and more secrets being kept from me.

684
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,820
So what did you talk about with the Queen?

685
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,220
Today at the lake

686
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,040
You saw it

687
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,680
Is there anything I can't see?

688
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,280
No

689
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,160
Chatted about the canonization of the harem

690
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,810
Harem

691
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,850
You'll probably be unhappy to hear that.

692
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,210
It is necessary to divert the attention of the Jin family

693
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,530
Establish new forces that can participate in the competition

694
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,770
The constraints on the crown will also be weakened

695
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,510
so

696
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,630
Did she express happiness?

697
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,740
Yes

698
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,020
This is the Queen's plan.

699
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,720
Concubine

700
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,280
How can you call me like that?

701
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,190
How come you never call my name again?

702
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,980
His Highness once said

703
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,700
I am the one who made His Highness happy and sad.

704
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,320
Now

705
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,090
Has the person who can shake His Highness' mood changed?

706
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:30,930
Flowers are real

707
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,890
Tell me

708
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,710
Your Highness's Sincerity

709
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,180
Does His Highness have feelings for the Queen?

710
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,060
The focus of Western food is seasoning and presentation

711
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,080
Especially the presentation is the flower of Western cuisine

712
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,700
Come

713
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,620
Use this

714
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,910
Can soup give off different flavors?

715
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,130
But why are you alone?

716
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,330
What

717
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,760
I was doing things and before I knew it, I was the only one left.

718
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,740
What about parents and brothers?

719
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,230
In the year of Yixu, all of them were killed by thieves.

720
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,700
Then I became one.

721
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,060
My father believed those people

722
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,210
So I don't believe anything

723
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,740
Alone

724
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,710
It must be lonely.

725
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,000
There are more than one or two people like me.

726
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,020
It's a bit lonely when there's only one person left during the festival

727
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,240
But the good thing is

728
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,320
Everyone died at once.

729
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,540
So the sacrifice only needs to be done once.

730
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,190
What?

731
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,330
Why is it so?

732
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,800
How do you know that I am against sad men?

733
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,250
It's easy to soften your heart

734
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:03,000
Is it sour?

735
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,550
The food has turned sour.

736
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,580
It's the cook's sad words.

737
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,050
Food will become sour

738
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,210
I understand

739
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,750
So before I entered the imperial kitchen

740
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,040
Whether happy or sad

741
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,040
I will throw it away first.

742
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,780
I see you crying every day

743
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,500
That's because

744
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,970
The Queen Mother wanders around all day and it's annoying

745
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,340
This should be blamed on my lack of practice.

746
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,360
Why are you blaming others?

747
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,800
Look, look, look, look.

748
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,000
Look, look.

749
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,740
Are you speaking plain language now?

750
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,480
Please look at it. Please look at it.

751
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,140
More fire

752
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,920
Just throw your head out.

753
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,280
Blame me for being soft-hearted

754
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,600
It hasn't been long since I last had a meal.

755
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,540
Come

756
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,030
Please don't eat

757
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,280
Give in to your skin

758
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,450
That's why things exist.

759
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,920
From K-food to K-beauty

760
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,070
It's a great day for drying peppers.

761
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,250
Empress of the Middle Temple

762
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,410
I didn't see you yesterday.

763
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,970
I don't know if it was because of the hangover.

764
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,520
Can you move a little bit?

765
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,100
I have something to ask you

766
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,990
Do you still remember what happened before you went to the countryside?

767
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,890
Strange or suspicious behavior

768
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,200
If you want to talk about suspicious actions

769
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,480
Who is it referring to?

770
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,000
No matter who it is

771
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,400
In fact

772
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,430
My fainting seems to be related to that world

773
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,460
Does that world refer to other forces?

774
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,300
no

775
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,040
Anyway

776
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:45,780
I mean it happens naturally.

777
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,240
Although you may be shocked, I want to tell you

778
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,260
I have doubts about the Lord

779
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,720
After understanding

780
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,220
Those who want to harm the queen in Wuta Pavilion

781
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,240
He is the one who read the horoscope for His Majesty.

782
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,550
It really shocked me.

783
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,160
How do you know?

784
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,190
No one else knows

785
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,830
Did you know

786
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,260
that

787
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,640
that is

788
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:14,540
This is because we are

789
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,160
There are many things involved

790
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,130
So we cover up the past for each other.

791
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,050
My lady, even now that you know all this, are you still like this?

792
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,540
No matter what the Lord did

793
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,760
Will the intention of the rebels never change?

794
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,010
What

795
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,350
Conspiracy

796
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,460
How can you say such terrible things?

797
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,590
I want to live well here.

798
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,470
You can't go against the Lord.

799
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,480
Just live without getting in each other's way

800
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,920
How can you think like that?

801
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,260
I was already in crisis because of the legitimacy of the matter.

802
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,620
How can you still call it a conspiracy?

803
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,180
What do you want me to do?

804
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,700
Choi Sang-Gong

805
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,280
Choi Sang-Gong

806
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,910
Sister, I'm coming

807
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,130
Where to go

808
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,980
Here

809
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,180
What is this?

810
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,340
Who would get through a rough day just to watch this?

811
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,360
What is this?

812
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,090
Sure enough, it was broken here.

813
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,080
I did this for my family.

814
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,160
What is this called?

815
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,280
It's called a facial mask

816
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,730
Looking for a replacement

817
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,440
Instead, they came up with new technology.

818
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,050
Niangniang

819
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,670
Kim Byeong-in

820
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,600
At this time?

821
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,000
Come in

822
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,020
I did receive a message saying hello.

823
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,250
But is it too late?

824
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,430
I couldn't convey this to you.

825
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,500
What made me dare to come to see the queen like this was

826
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,430
Because I have something to convey to my father away from his sight.

827
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,760
For the father

828
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,520
The Lord is different from the previous King.

829
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,060
But my father was wrong

830
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,200
Don't follow me

831
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,790
As agreed

832
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,610
this

833
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,570
It is red ginseng

834
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,000
this

835
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:50,620
Thanks

836
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:53,990
but

837
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,220
Nothing else?

838
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,060
What else are you talking about?

839
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,130
Say exactly what you want to say.

840
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,230
What do you want to say?

841
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,160
Just a greeting from time to time.

842
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,390
but

843
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,830
It seems that Byeong-in is still in the palace.

844
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,230
You are here, father-in-law

845
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,600
I'm back

846
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,080
A bit late

847
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,470
Because I haven't been able to spend much time with my colleagues since I took up my post.

848
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,240
So I just drank two cups

849
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,670
well done

850
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,640
It's late. Let's go in and have a rest.

851
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,870
yes

852
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,880
You guys chat.

853
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,690
Okay, you take a rest.

854
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,420
you

855
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,570
yes

856
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,620
Looks uneasy.

857
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:55,690
Originally

858
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,260
Something happened that was beyond my power.

859
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,610
I will feel uneasy.

860
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,620
What does this mean?

861
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,010
Caused dangerous things

862
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,070
Not just you

863
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,890
Even the Queen Mother will be in danger

864
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,290
How could you not understand?

865
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,060
If I feel uneasy

866
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,130
That's because we haven't caught the person who murdered the Queen.

867
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,210
Yeah

868
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,410
It's late.

869
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,030
Adults must be tired too.

870
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,250
I mainly want to convey gifts

871
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,070
I'll leave first.

872
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,680
Lost the account book

873
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,120
If you are not in the prison

874
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,590
Byeong-in is alone

875
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,540
If it is this time

876
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,670
Shouldn't

877
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,400
Thank you

878
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,160
This is not what I did

879
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,570
To find a corpse of similar size

880
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,980
It took some time

881
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,900
What kind of corpse is it?

882
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,670
The body was soaked in water for a long time.

883
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,040
So I can't recognize the face.

884
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,500
Tell me

885
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,280
Your Highness's Sincerity

886
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:40,630
Does His Highness have feelings for the Queen?

887
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,340
I

888
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,430
You can't have feelings for the middle temple.

889
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,510
No, no.

890
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,560
But you can't have it.

891
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,140
Niangniang

892
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,440
It's Yongping Jun

893
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,940
yes

894
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:18,830
Come in

895
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,860
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

896
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,430
Because there's news you should know.

897
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,800
Have you found the red moon?

898
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,390
Is this the gift from you?

899
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:50,300
That's right

900
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,710
If this is the answer

901
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,420
That's her.

902
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,710
Red Moon is still alive

903
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,260
Very good

904
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,040
Why are you making such a fuss about fetching water so late at night?

905
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,980
Don't let me go in advance.

906
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,410
What's stuck?

907
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,090
What is that?

908
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,590
Someone who looks similar to him was found in the harem

909
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,340
I'm more convinced after receiving this.

910
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,880
I actually

911
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,590
To help His Highness

912
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,480
Niangniang

913
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,610
Well

914
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,570
In the well?

915
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,140
Body found in well

916
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,820
Like the queen's servant Hongyue

917
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,210
Red Moon

918
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,460
It will be a big blow. I'm going

919
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,630
No, I want to see it with my own eyes.

920
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,180
It must have been in the water for a long time.

921
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,390
How suffocating and painful it is

922
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,070
Stop it

923
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:43,840
This is just the beginning

924
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,920
Niangniang

925
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,110
I want to stay alone

926
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,560
A person who makes people happy and sad

927
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,860
Your Highness, the Queen Mother has arrived.

928
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,960
Why

929
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,600
What are you watching

930
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,030
Looking at the previous appeal

931
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,850
Seeing His Majesty more eager than before

932
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,110
I'm curious about what you're doing privately so I came to see you.

933
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,870
This is a time to temporarily forget the worries of the court.

934
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,370
fortunately

935
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,280
I want your Highness to be happy.

936
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,840
My son is terrified

937
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,510
Your Highness has been through a very difficult time.

938
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,490
Did you forget so quickly?

939
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,720
I don't know if fate is also inherited.

940
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,210
Know how to be honest and thankful for reality

941
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:51,460
Nothing will happen to me and the precious people around me.

942
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,900
Why can't you be honest?

943
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:02,230
