1
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,460
(The characters in this play are purely fictional
Group events, etc. have nothing to do with history)

2
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,680
I also smelled it at that time

3
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,740
The room smells like that.

4
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,350
ah

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,910
The rich fragrance has already been integrated into the cuffs

6
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,100
It's you

7
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,640
It's you

8
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,700
Worst case is the left cuff

9
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,090
Me now

10
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:33,900
What I need most is you

11
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,940
(Episode 4)
What I need most is you

12
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,490
(Episode 4)

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,120
This is the tea

14
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,440
I'm so lucky you like it

15
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,280
Just to test if I still remember

16
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,510
That's why I keep pestering you.

17
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,370
Niangniang

18
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,850
Why are you so pale?

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Still sweating

20
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,980
Really? It's okay.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
I didn't sleep well last night and I'm a little tired

22
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:48,558
This tea is even more useful.

23
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:51,312
Have a drink and take a nap

24
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:53,928
Food Test

25
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,784
You can drink it now

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,510
I'll come, you go down.

27
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,630
Drink it. It's delicious.

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,520
Pretend you don't know

29
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,770
Only in this way can we survive

30
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,020
Why do you keep asking me to drink tea?

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,980
It's not poisonous, is it?

32
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,330
What's wrong

33
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,300
The taste

34
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,620
It's really great

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,430
It's a blessing

36
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,620
When is dinner?

37
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,420
Poison is absorbed faster on an empty stomach

38
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,240
He wants to know this

39
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,410
You've been caring about me recently.

40
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,380
It's just that I was busy with government affairs before.

41
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,540
I've always been concerned about your family.

42
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,810
And you

43
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,050
So

44
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,670
Please drink

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,620
To show your love

46
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,590
If you want

47
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,750
Isn't it?

48
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,590
You stinky boy

49
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,470
Because you said it was love

50
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,670
what are you up to

51
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,530
Let go, I'm going to vomit, damn it.

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,920
Are you saying I poisoned the Highness?

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,900
What's wrong

54
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,410
Any reason?

55
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,480
Damn

56
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,140
Wait

57
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,970
If it takes a long time

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,360
Are you safe, Lord?

59
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,770
It can prove my innocence

60
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,730
What if I say no?

61
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,390
At first, my tongue felt numb.

62
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,440
If you feel your tongue becomes stiff

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Just move your fingers

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,500
Do you think I won't?

65
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,670
I think you will

66
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,160
Still very good at

67
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,220
I saw

68
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,190
Even if I die

69
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,200
I won't die alone

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,640
(Episode 4: The Man Who Knew Too Much)

71
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,900
Niangniang

72
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,420
I can't do it anymore

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,870
Even if the knife is on your neck

74
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,790
I can't do it either.

75
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,930
I feel like dying too. Damn it.

76
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,570
Why

77
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,050
Be careful

78
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,310
Are you trying to kill me while you're napping?

79
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,500
That's weird.

80
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,080
What did you feed me?

81
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,050
There is one thing I am curious about.

82
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,220
The last time I went to the Annex, that night

83
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,900
What did you do?

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,500
I want to go out

85
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,330
I'm leaving here

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,820
The way back is right in front of you

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,100
I can't die

88
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,200
That night

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,370
What happened to you, Lord?

90
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,450
Danger

91
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,240
Can't say

92
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,440
knew

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
What did you say

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,370
That night

95
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,580
you

96
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,600
Want to kill me

97
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,580
She knows

98
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,280
Since you know this

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,360
Why have you been hiding it?

100
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,770
What are you planning?

101
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,980
Because I don't know

102
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,570
Thanks to the cup of tea you just gave me

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,350
I also found out what happened

104
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,400
What a shame

105
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,330
If I had known I should have killed you

106
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,810
Bad Guy

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,140
Even if I fall in love with another woman

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,290
How can you kill your own wife?

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,150
Can you still be considered a human being?

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,570
Anyway, Zhao Huazhen is your harem now

111
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,190
Legal incest is not enough

112
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,330
Do you want to kill your wife with your own hands?

113
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,930
Don't know the reason

114
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,390
nave

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,290
You heard something you shouldn't have heard that day in the middle temple

116
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,390
What did you hear?

117
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,940
Answer me

118
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,210
What did you hear?

119
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,750
There are other reasons

120
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,610
You want to kill this woman.

121
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,870
There is a very valid reason

122
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,780
is that so

123
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,110
So funny

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
Whatever I heard

125
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,580
Or you are madly in love with a woman

126
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,560
There is only one reason to want to kill me.

127
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,130
Because I am weaker than you

128
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,590
If I were better than you

129
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,360
You can't do this to me.

130
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,530
Because killing me is easy.

131
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,500
Because I am weaker than you

132
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,840
That's the real reason

133
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,540
Come

134
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,080
One more time

135
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,560
Prove that you are just a

136
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,600
A murderer who kills a weak person

137
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,720
Damn

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,790
I'm so mad

139
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,340
Niangniang

140
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,240
How dare a guy like that look down on me?

141
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,100
Damn

142
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
If it were the original me

143
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,790
One punch can kill

144
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,960
Damn

145
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,720
how's it going

146
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,570
I always thought

147
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,310
I am a weak person fighting against the strong

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,740
So I think there is a way for me to act

149
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,470
All are legitimate

150
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,560
The middle temple already knows

151
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,730
I want to kill her.

152
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,210
I think I have good reason to kill the nave.

153
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,950
She wasn't the only one who eavesdropped on us.

154
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Also because the nave is acquiescent and condoning

155
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,310
They are domineering people

156
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,070
So think

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,090
It is justified to kill such a nave.

158
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,980
But that's just a shitty excuse.

159
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,190
Because I don't have the confidence to face the real strong

160
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,540
That's why I want to attack the weakest prince.

161
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,390
Your Highness

162
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,370
If the opponent is weak

163
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,380
What's the difference between me and them?

164
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,150
We can only focus on the justice of our purpose

165
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,230
As long as the result is just

166
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,400
The method is also just

167
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,910
The Kim family can't win by legitimate means

168
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,550
Can't be shaken

169
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,060
They must be planning something terrible.

170
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,180
Now only the middle temple knows

171
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,110
The middle hall just found out.

172
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,160
Now we must seal the mouth of the nave immediately

173
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,620
Their family will know sooner or later.

174
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,780
I will never use despicable means again

175
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,790
Your Highness

176
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
Because the Queen is from the Kim family

177
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,980
So we were a bit hasty in judging her.

178
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,630
The behavior of the middle temple was unexpected

179
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,390
Anyway, I'm not who you think I am.

180
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,870
What you see is not all

181
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,700
The middle temple said she was someone else

182
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,640
It is possible that the nave is

183
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,480
I want to say that I have a different idea

184
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,600
People who can make different choices

185
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,460
What are you looking forward to?

186
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
The nave is just

187
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,440
The Kim family

188
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,210
Although I am just a puppet king

189
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,550
Just a word from the nave

190
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,910
You can't do anything to me.

191
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Because there is no conclusive evidence

192
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,940
I want to observe the choice of the nave

193
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,660
This way we can see who the middle temple is.

194
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,440
I have found the source of this fabric.

195
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,170
that

196
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,900
It's in the palace.

197
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,990
Why

198
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,950
Stealing something so valuable

199
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,830
Too conspicuous

200
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,770
The power of ordinary scholars

201
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,170
There definitely can't be.

202
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,810
That?

203
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,910
I don't know how much money you will give me.

204
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,690
I've suffered a lot, Master.

205
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,370
Thanks for your hard work

206
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,520
after

207
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,620
Hard, Dirty Things

208
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,900
Leave it all to me.

209
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,530
In the palace?

210
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,070
Only rely on

211
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,330
It's not enough to shake Concubine Yi's heart

212
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,460
Need one

213
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,540
The chance that can really shake her heart

214
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,970
Now the weakness of the concubine is

215
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,180
Lake incident

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
If that's the case

217
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,140
To find a criminal

218
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,690
No power and no strength

219
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,350
Like a fawn without a mother

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
Such a person

221
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,800
Where have the money-makers gone?

222
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,420
Why haven't you dealt the cards yet?

223
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,950
I shaved all your hair off

224
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,620
You can't even notice

225
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,950
that

226
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,890
No

227
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,400
Nothing nothing

228
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,430
Any troubles?

229
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,770
Recently,

230
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,620
There are many vicious criminals

231
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,840
I recently met a new friend

232
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,000
Li Sheng-li

233
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,720
Always feel

234
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,040
He was also killed by a bad guy outside the palace.

235
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,010
Was he also killed? Who else was killed?

236
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,100
My feeling is very accurate.

237
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,790
yes

238
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,150
My cousin, Brother Bingren

239
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,440
Holding a piece of robe cloth

240
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,900
I've been investigating someone.

241
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,870
That's what I mean

242
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,330
According to my keen sense

243
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,120
The owner of the robe cloth is a vicious criminal

244
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,860
Give my friend

245
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,300
Killing is not enough

246
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,260
Something happened with Brother Bingren

247
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,090
What do you think?

248
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,930
I'm thinking

249
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,690
Such a sensitive person

250
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,010
It's not used in Sungkyunkwan.

251
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,150
This is a huge loss for North Korea.

252
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,330
You have sharp eyes like me.

253
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,170
oops

254
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,880
Something terrible is happening.

255
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,470
Spare my life

256
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,300
I'll do anything to ask for your mercy.

257
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,030
lord lord madam

258
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,160
I don't know who you are, please.

259
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,180
Please

260
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,140
I didn't see anything

261
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,590
Lift your head

262
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,760
No

263
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,680
I don't want to die

264
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,600
You can't see my face anyway.

265
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,940
There is a respected person

266
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,950
I want to hear you say one thing

267
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,430
I

268
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,600
I don't know anything

269
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,370
A palace person like me

270
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,830
What can you know

271
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,900
You know

272
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,890
The criminal who wanted to kill the Queen in the lake

273
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,460
Just say the name

274
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,570
You can survive

275
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,630
Fearful Lady

276
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,850
Although it's hard to drink

277
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,940
But it is very effective

278
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,980
Yesterday, my uncle brought me one.

279
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,820
Very precious things

280
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,900
I feel very comfortable after drinking it on an empty stomach for a day

281
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,490
My uncle is really good at finding good things.

282
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,040
The royal chef also serves as a consultant to manage precious items

283
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,460
It is convenient

284
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,730
I wonder how the situation in the other palace is going now.

285
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,550
There is someone I can trust with this matter.

286
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,820
Already prepared

287
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,030
Yeah

288
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,090
If today ends

289
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,710
One less thing for me to worry about.

290
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes

291
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,090
There's no way you can get away so easily this time.

292
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,110
Kim Byung-In

293
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,320
Investigate the veil of His Majesty behind the scenes

294
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,720
I've dealt with the veil.

295
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,790
but

296
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,340
Now that the Central Palace has learned about it

297
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,140
If Jin Bingren knew everything, he would attack me.

298
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,950
It means I was wrong about the nave.

299
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,270
This is a dangerous gamble

300
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,170
I know

301
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,860
But

302
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,040
If my judgment is correct

303
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,850
No innocent people will be hurt.

304
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,910
Today is the day when the uncle of the king is appointed

305
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,700
The first day of the Grand Guardsman

306
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,730
Your Highness

307
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,390
I thought you were still in the Great Hall.

308
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,430
So please come and order

309
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,260
I have to

310
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,680
Knowledge to share with Yongping-kun

311
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,010
Are you so surprised?

312
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,860
Shang Shan

313
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,520
yes

314
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,690
Psychopathic guy

315
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,560
I was so stupid that I thought he was a fool.

316
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,640
It's all acting.

317
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,650
The king wanted to kill the princess himself

318
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,680
Exposing this huge scandal

319
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,590
Maybe I will be involved in it for no reason.

320
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,650
Becoming more dangerous

321
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,500
Until the lake is filled

322
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,560
As long as you stay quiet until then, you can go back.

323
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,620
Isn't your arm numb?

324
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,220
It's been like this for a while

325
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,170
Only in this way can I feel at ease

326
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,070
How did it spread so randomly?

327
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,420
What did you eat?

328
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,490
really

329
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,100
Don't relax for a moment

330
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,560
But if you wanted to kill me, you would have poisoned me long ago.

331
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,070
Why

332
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,510
No matter

333
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Do I even need to know about the condition of a mentally ill person?

334
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,270
I want to see how much water has been filled into the lake.

335
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,670
there is nothing

336
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,240
Is there something you can measure? I'm in a hurry.

337
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,420
Niangniang

338
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,850
The Queen Mother asks you to pass

339
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,780
I'm done with that.

340
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,620
hateful

341
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,580
Why does she always call me over?

342
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,740
Really

343
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
Speed up now

344
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,350
Work harder! Work harder!

345
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,580
What are you doing? Hurry up.

346
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,950
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

347
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,070
Try harder

348
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,550
Hurry up and work harder

349
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,580
Be careful and hurry up

350
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,820
It's really too urgent.

351
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,520
After I solved it

352
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,810
be right back

353
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,770
I'm so busy. Come back soon.

354
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,590
Keep up Keep up

355
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,670
I heard you were coming.

356
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,980
I'm waiting for you too.

357
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,990
Why are you looking for me?

358
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,860
Concubine

359
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,760
I care about you very much.

360
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,450
Holy Grace

361
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
You said it was because of debt

362
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,570
You have a brother in prison?

363
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,380
Yes

364
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,570
He is my only blood relative.

365
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,000
I heard you were worried.

366
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,130
I took great pains to rescue my brother.

367
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,920
Although using various means to raise money

368
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,550
But because originally

369
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,260
It's a lot of money

370
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,850
The Queen Mother has a suggestion for you.

371
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,720
For you

372
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,810
There won't be a second chance.

373
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,560
How long does it take?

374
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
Can't hold on for long

375
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,140
Spread this too

376
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,840
The person who sent this letter

377
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,300
It's the concubine

378
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,570
I see

379
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,870
If you bear that kind of crime

380
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,780
Not just me

381
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,630
Even my brother won't be safe.

382
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,930
You don't have to worry about your brother.

383
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,300
Your Sacrifice

384
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,250
It's bringing a new life to your brother.

385
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,120
but

386
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,640
What is the younger brother

387
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,600
How long can you endure the hard life?

388
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Maybe tomorrow

389
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,710
What unexpected things will happen?

390
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,190
Unexpected?

391
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,620
Are you looking for me, Queen Dowager?

392
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,930
I called you here

393
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,430
I hope you can host a very important event.

394
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,770
What a hassle. What should I do?

395
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,690
I still have shortcomings

396
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,400
It's too early to take on the responsibility, Queen Dowager

397
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,370
Yeah

398
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,980
There's nothing we can do.

399
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,950
Because the master is deeply obsessed with women and cannot break free

400
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,310
I also plan to find an outstanding woman to join my harem

401
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,490
I have to show up in person.

402
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,420
Mencius said

403
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,930
If you do good deeds, you will help more people.

404
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,320
Good righteousness brings many supporters

405
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,330
Although I still have shortcomings

406
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,270
During this period of time, Jide

407
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,160
There are many things around that need help

408
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,300
I will do my best

409
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,750
but

410
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,100
What about the harem?

411
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,730
How many people are MAX?

412
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,020
MAX?

413
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,330
That is to say

414
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,990
Most words

415
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,090
How many people can be enthroned?

416
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,610
This

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
It is said that

418
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,660
The Emperor's Back Palace

419
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,530
By Liugong

420
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,480
The Third Lady

421
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,430
Nine Concubines

422
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,040
Twenty-seventh Lady

423
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,980
Eighty-one wives

424
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,980
Internal governance

425
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,130
6 plus 3

426
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,420
9 27

427
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,260
81

428
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,030
Let's simply choose Sannomiya

429
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,300
That's right

430
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,800
There's already a harem.

431
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,840
You mean to pick two more, right?

432
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,920
no

433
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,220
Pick three.

434
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,590
There was a child named Hongyue who was brought in by the concubine.

435
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,180
The one who followed her like a samurai

436
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,060
The child lost his words.

437
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,560
Self-righteousness

438
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,740
In order to make Zhao Huazhen bear the blame

439
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,040
Jumped into the lake in front of her

440
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,470
This is what Hongyue said

441
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,360
She herself broke the thing that the master protected with lies

442
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,390
My Lord?

443
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,280
Since the toy that the master cherished so much was taken away

444
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,750
This is to give him a new toy.

445
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,830
That's right

446
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,490
Please prepare my imperial meal today, too.

447
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,700
Now I can't eat the imperial meal prepared by others

448
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,950
This is a bit difficult.

449
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,500
Eat the healthy dishes I make every day

450
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,080
If you become younger than me

451
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,730
This is really difficult.

452
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,870
Until the lake is filled

453
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,660
This is feeding medicine.

454
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,130
Things turned out to be as Kim So-yong wished.

455
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,950
Zhao Huazhen fell completely into the trap

456
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,100
This woman will be punished by God if she continues like this

457
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,680
Only Zhao Huazhen became pitiful

458
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,750
But what does it have to do with me?

459
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,870
I'll go back and say goodbye.

460
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,500
Instead of worrying about the fate of others

461
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,110
I'm too busy taking care of my destiny.

462
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,350
Go at twice the speed.

463
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,120
The two walked slowly

464
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,090
If you go too fast, you might fall.

465
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,950
Hurry up! Hurry up!

466
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,460
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

467
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,800
Hurry up, hurry up, that's right, hurry up, hurry up

468
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,380
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

469
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,110
That's right

470
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,970
This ride feeling

471
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,990
Only people with a certain level can enjoy it

472
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,340
very nice

473
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,220
You're here, uncle.

474
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,740
Today is the last day for Yongping Jun

475
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,910
It must be very sad.

476
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,690
No

477
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,310
The prince will lead better than me.

478
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,620
where

479
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,280
What a handsome horse.

480
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,670
This is a gift from His Majesty.

481
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,200
Special military horse for the general of the imperial guard

482
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,950
Take a ride and see

483
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,010
I haven't ridden a horse for a long time.

484
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,780
Today, I received your Highness's appointment letter at the Imperial Court Meeting.

485
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,130
It is considered a formal appointment

486
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,640
What about horses?

487
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,880
Ride slowly.

488
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,760
Uncle

489
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,030
Can you ride a horse?

490
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Not who this is

491
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,210
I am your highness's best friend.

492
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,270
It was also chosen by the palace maids.

493
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,080
The top five most attractive men in the palace...

494
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,830
There is no need

495
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,910
People who know

496
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,410
Yongping Jun changed the order

497
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,860
Back to the point

498
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,090
Uncle

499
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,640
This isn't a body type suitable for riding a horse.

500
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,500
Especially this horse is very tall

501
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,620
Can I ride it with these legs?

502
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,150
What are you talking about

503
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,600
When I was a kid

504
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,080
Riding a horse like running with both hands

505
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,860
I don't know how comfortable it is on the horse

506
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,690
sometimes

507
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,080
Even fell asleep dreaming

508
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,450
It's true

509
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,230
I'll prove it to you. Take it.

510
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,260
You don't have to ride it.

511
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,460
Really

512
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,600
Really

513
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,480
I've said it all, no forcing

514
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,070
yes

515
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,870
that

516
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,160
Come come come

517
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,080
Come Come

518
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,800
How about it

519
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,460
Is it light?

520
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,060
Caught

521
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,450
Arm Arm Arm

522
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,720
Uncle of the King

523
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,630
My legs

524
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,370
Legs legs my legs

525
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,070
Potato Salt

526
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,120
milk

527
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:33,810
Milk?

528
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,090
This is the first time I heard of this ingredient

529
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,510
In today's words

530
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,130
Camel cheese

531
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,620
OK

532
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,330
Then the precious camel cheese will be used like water.

533
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,750
There should be no butter

534
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,220
Is there any pepper?

535
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,680
Some ladies

536
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,460
Pepper is more precious than gold

537
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,770
It should be like spreading sand.

538
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,850
What's the point of saying it? I won't say it anymore.

539
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,800
I can hear it all

540
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,410
Niangniang

541
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,910
I told you to walk slowly, why are you running over here again?

542
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,240
Choi Sang-Gong clearly said she would come

543
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,670
I'm old.

544
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,030
Will I faint while running?

545
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,860
Choi Sang-Gong is here

546
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,510
Even though I'm a certain age

547
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,990
But I won't faint.

548
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,930
Very resilient

549
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,170
Come

550
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,070
Keep falling

551
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,210
It's the queen

552
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,660
Are you kidding?

553
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,580
that

554
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,700
This is...

555
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,670
Niangniang

556
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,280
Do you know how valuable camel cheese is?

557
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,450
Because it is precious, I am using it now.

558
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,570
Eighty percent of a dish depends on the ingredients

559
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,590
If you squeeze all the milk out of the cow

560
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,350
The calf will be hungry.

561
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,000
There is also cognition

562
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,160
So sad

563
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,950
But intermittent fasting

564
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,960
Going hungry occasionally is good for your health

565
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,710
Camel cheese is poured here

566
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,830
Even if there is one drop missing

567
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,150
You know?

568
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,110
Yes, my lady.

569
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,230
Really

570
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,720
Who are you?

571
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,710
The little girl dared to enter the imperial kitchen

572
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,510
Cough cough cough

573
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,290
Come here

574
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,460
May I have your name

575
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,060
Tan Yang

576
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,710
But you can still keep dogs in the palace?

577
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,560
The dog

578
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,390
Higher than my position

579
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,550
A dog that came with the Ming Dynasty envoys

580
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,160
Saying that the ancestors were of noble blood or something

581
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,960
The Ming Dynasty was more than 200 years ago.

582
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,220
In such a long time

583
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,640
If you mate with other dogs

584
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,980
This is totally a dog.

585
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,540
What is the name of the native dog?

586
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,810
It has no name

587
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,490
Yeah

588
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,520
So

589
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,750
Call it puppy.

590
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,130
Puppy?

591
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,030
Look

592
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,650
If you look at the words "Xiao Wangwang" from other angles

593
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,400
Puppy

594
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,660
Like a puppy.

595
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,460
So it's called puppy dog

596
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,080
Puppy

597
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,010
You are hungry

598
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,460
I've been wandering around here.

599
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,610
Wait a moment

600
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,870
Look

601
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,420
Eat it

602
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,620
Come

603
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,780
Why not eat

604
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,920
Because I can't bear to eat my empress

605
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,050
Don't worry it's not free

606
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,000
Eat all this

607
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,340
Help me peel potatoes

608
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,400
no

609
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,170
The Queen Mother is a member of the royal family, so I won't mention it.

610
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,070
Food from the Imperial Kitchen

611
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,520
Traditionally, women are not allowed to touch

612
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,700
Except for setting the table and serving the imperial meal

613
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,350
A lowly child who doesn't even hold an official position...

614
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,360
child

615
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,820
How dare that child

616
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,110
You are not allowed to participate in the cooking

617
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,250
Old stubborn

618
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,940
You also say that the old stubborn

619
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,020
Old stubborn

620
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,800
She is very good at speaking word for word.

621
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,440
This one too

622
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,460
Free food

623
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,280
Eat, eat, eat.

624
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,570
It's like eating clouds, sis

625
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,050
You have the talent to express taste.

626
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,600
Now you can do food broadcasting

627
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,710
but

628
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,570
You're too young to enter the palace.

629
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Her parents

630
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,950
Unable to avoid taxes, went into exile but got caught

631
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,880
The whole family became servants of the government

632
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,370
Her father ran away alone without being caught.

633
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,810
Really, this is also called dad

634
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,460
Waiting for experienced people

635
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,740
Is this something you should say in front of your kids?

636
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,270
Tan Yang

637
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,840
You should only see the good and only listen to the good

638
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,630
Fool

639
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,960
Tell me

640
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,940
Fool

641
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,530
fool...

642
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:08,380
(Fool)

643
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,050
fool
(Fool)

644
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:09,370
(Fool)

645
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,160
fool
(Fool)

646
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,360
(Fool)

647
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,260
Why are the potato balls so big?

648
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,490
Why hasn't Camel come yet?

649
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,790
Niangniang

650
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,370
I took all the cattle and sheep in the palace.

651
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,310
Squeeze until there is no more milk left

652
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,220
well done

653
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,650
It's the queen

654
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,010
Camel cheese porridge

655
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,410
How can you put meatballs in the precious camel cheese porridge?

656
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,300
That that

657
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,750
Is it really my mother-in-law?

658
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,740
Recently, the mother-in-law has been looking at her daughter-in-law.

659
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,520
Not mother-in-law

660
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,690
See my daughter-in-law...

661
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,170
How can you say such a thing?

662
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,660
OK

663
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,620
I'll serve it myself.

664
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,130
Delicious

665
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,450
but

666
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,110
Somewhat sticky and coagulated feeling

667
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,390
The precious sauce leaked out of the bowl

668
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,090
It feels quite a pity.

669
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,300
Too

670
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,340
It can't always be perfect.

671
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,840
What's the point of cooking perfectly?

672
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,650
The service is lagging behind.

673
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,960
How to avoid getting cold

674
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,340
And there will be no leakage of delivery

675
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,090
This is the key.

676
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,560
A master of life

677
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,650
I asked you to clear this before.

678
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,600
Haven't you done it yet?

679
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,920
What do you do?

680
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,640
Empress of the Middle Temple Empress of the Middle Temple

681
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,650
Empress of the Middle Temple

682
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,700
I need a sedan chair

683
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,410
Niangniang

684
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,070
MILF

685
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,380
Food sedan?

686
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,260
Eat a sedan chair Eat a sedan chair Eat a sedan chair

687
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,370
Food sedan

688
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,510
What is a food sedan?

689
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,500
Food sedan

690
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,650
What did you say?

691
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,100
Be careful. Be careful.

692
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,600
Line

693
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,680
The Queen is here

694
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:43,670
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

695
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,640
Come

696
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,120
1 2 1 2

697
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,830
What?

698
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,060
It's still empty.

699
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,900
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

700
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,950
Are you sure it's under construction?

701
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,610
yes

702
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,430
Even the replacement staff had to stay up all night to scoop water

703
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,820
But because it was originally a very wide lake

704
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,800
I thought it would only take one day to drain the water.

705
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,400
Why does it take so long to fill up?

706
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,480
Such a big lake

707
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,340
It's still possible to scoop out all the water and follow the trend.

708
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,160
No matter what

709
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,400
Absolutely because there is no manager

710
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,820
So there was some negligence

711
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,490
today

712
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,530
After the evening handover

713
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,010
(Handover-shift)
After the evening handover

714
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:27,370
(Handover-shift)

715
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,530
How about we go have a drink together?
(Handover-shift)

716
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,090
How about we go have a drink together?

717
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,360
Ask you how are you?

718
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,680
Ask how it is

719
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
You guys

720
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,890
What is the matter with Choi Sang-Gong coming here alone?

721
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,810
The queen instructed to prepare cool drinks

722
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,600
Madam?

723
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,240
Yeah

724
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,780
So letâ€™s do two simple ones.

725
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,990
In the pickled Schisandra

726
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,700
After being scooped out,

727
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,710
Adding honey enhances the sweetness

728
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,980
Add pears and oranges to create a cool feeling

729
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:15,080
Even without using ice cold water, it is refreshing enough

730
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,770
On top of this

731
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,860
Because there are no azaleas now

732
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,710
Remove the core of evening primrose

733
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,450
Stick with starch

734
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,300
Rinse in boiling water and then in cold water

735
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,110
Put it into the juice

736
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,080
Finally, add three cores to add the finishing touch

737
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,360
Drinks of this level

738
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,570
I can do it with my eyes closed.

739
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,270
You did it with your eyes open

740
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,220
I saw it all

741
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,560
Why are you so cold to me?

742
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,140
It makes people feel shy

743
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,810
Come on, come on

744
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,380
Niangniang

745
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,520
This is what you call a cool drink.

746
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,880
Let me see

747
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,660
Although I'm not at that time now

748
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,720
But since you can't avoid it, just enjoy it.

749
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,100
Really cool

750
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,960
How long does it feel like?

751
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,950
At this speed

752
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,160
Before tonight

753
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,960
Before sunset

754
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,720
This is absolutely impossible

755
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,760
This is really

756
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,070
It must be finished today.

757
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,140
Otherwise you'll lose your head.

758
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,330
yes

759
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,330
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

760
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,020
And the Imperial Kitchen ordered

761
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,490
People who are here

762
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,280
Give this to everyone.

763
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,500
So many people?

764
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:24,260
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

765
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,520
Look how fast it came back.

766
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,370
It seems like he is fascinated by my craftsmanship.

767
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,570
Maybe I should prepare another drink.

768
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,790
OK

769
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,440
Said to prepare more drinks

770
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,080
I knew it would be like this

771
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,470
How about it

772
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,490
It's so delicious. Do you want another bowl?

773
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,910
otherwise

774
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,150
Is it so delicious that it makes you cry?

775
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,080
Choi Sang-Gong

776
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,220
I

777
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,100
That's the kind of person.

778
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,310
Waiting for experienced people Waiting for experienced people

779
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,890
Okay, you guys.

780
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,390
Waiting for experienced people

781
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,160
That's good

782
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,000
I will also prepare one for you, Choi Sang-Gong.

783
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,770
It seems that Choi Sang-Gong is also very

784
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,820
Do you like my drink?

785
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,150
Drinks are very

786
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,690
Very

787
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,640
I'll prepare another one for you.

788
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,910
Wait a minute

789
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,530
Since I have to prepare one more

790
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,160
Just prepare a little more.

791
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,670
Very good

792
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,330
How much more do you want?

793
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,190
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,430
Thank you, my lady.

795
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,350
Thank you, my lady, for such a precious thing.

796
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,650
very nice

797
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,570
Thank you so much, my lady.

798
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,210
Thanks Long En

799
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,420
Okay, okay, that's all.

800
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,280
Drink it!

801
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,270
It's super delicious

802
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,460
It's so easy to be coaxed.

803
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,890
Even the birds were fooled.

804
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,060
My perfect lurking ability

805
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,740
I didn't plan on this.

806
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,280
I'm thirsty too.

807
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,720
It's been really hard since yesterday.

808
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,330
I don't know what you're doing though.

809
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,630
this

810
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,430
Can you see mine?

811
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,730
Of course

812
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,010
So conspicuous

813
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,140
Prominent

814
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,090
This is what I mean.

815
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,880
The middle temple doesn't even know I'm there

816
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,350
So you just say everything.

817
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,170
I

818
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,860
I'm going to serve the queen.

819
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,310
bowl

820
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,050
Since the maid has discovered

821
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,200
That's all for today.

822
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,860
The moment she recognized me

823
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,810
I walked towards her

824
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,530
Became a flower boy

825
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,240
what to do

826
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,590
Will get hurt

827
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,810
Don't go empty-handed

828
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,650
Willing to hurt a wounded heart

829
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,260
like

830
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,010
Asking around

831
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,960
Nothing will happen.

832
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,550
Don't worry too much.

833
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,320
Red Moon is not that kind of

834
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,830
A child who disappears without speaking

835
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,310
Clearly something happened.

836
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,700
The Queen Mother Arrives

837
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,200
Concubine

838
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,720
Everybody, please step back.

839
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,500
Start now

840
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,390
Remember what I said

841
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,130
The only person you can trust in this palace now

842
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,490
I'm the only one on a boat

843
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,580
You want me to have no

844
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,310
Tell everything you have hidden

845
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,090
That's the only way to save the child.

846
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,400
Save ourselves too.

847
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,250
Isn't this great?

848
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,820
Me, Yongping-kun and Shangshan

849
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,700
Oh, Shangshan.

850
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,170
I asked you to prepare it last time.

851
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,700
What happened to my three manuals that the Middle Temple wanted?

852
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,760
What

853
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,920
You have never issued such an order.

854
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,980
Shang Shan

855
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,210
Is it because of my age that my memory is failing?

856
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,660
I clearly told you to do that.

857
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,610
At least go to the library now and complete the order.

858
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,360
You mean now?

859
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,390
Or are you going to forget again?

860
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,710
I will serve His Highness to the palace first, then go.

861
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,180
I'm not going alone.

862
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,680
There is also Yongping Jun beside

863
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,360
What's there to worry about?

864
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,210
Don't go quickly.

865
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,630
It is good

866
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,120
This stone head

867
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,110
Shang Shan

868
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,240
Are you injured?

869
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,530
It's fine

870
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,070
My nose seems to have become smaller.

871
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,280
Oops!

872
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,020
The nose is really

873
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,570
It was originally like that

874
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,980
How is it possible?

875
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,750
How can a person's nose be like this?

876
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,310
Go to the hospital immediately.

877
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,560
I've said it's okay.

878
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,250
The disappearing red moon

879
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,250
It was the day the nave fell into the lake.

880
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,420
The people rescued together with the concubine

881
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,140
It feels like I lied.

882
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,120
As soon as His Highness and the Queen knew about this

883
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,320
It happened right away

884
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,180
Not me

885
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:59,670
But he was targeting the concubine.

886
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,060
revenge

887
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,560
Is this the choice of the Middle Temple?

888
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,490
Your Highness

889
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,530
Huazhen

890
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,670
Really scared

891
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,110
This is not something you should be worried about.

892
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,300
It happened because of me

893
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,430
What does this mean?

894
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,420
Not long ago I intended to remove the nave

895
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,940
For revenge

896
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,600
I framed you for the lake incident.

897
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,280
This is a method they are very familiar with.

898
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,980
Just lie and put the blame on innocent people

899
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,320
I will reveal that it was me who intended to kill the Nave.

900
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,970
Your Highness

901
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,750
About revenge

902
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,060
My brother and I know each other very well.

903
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,860
I hope the other party will be treated the same way.

904
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,290
This is revenge.

905
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,250
Just like I did with the nave.

906
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,490
Now you are putting a knife on my neck.

907
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,980
How to suppress the desire for revenge

908
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,860
Only I kneel down

909
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,420
This method

910
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,530
Niangniang

911
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,080
I wanted it from the beginning.

912
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,990
He planned this incident by accusing me

913
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,300
As long as I come out

914
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,490
Everything will end

915
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,060
Your Highness needs to think about the greater cause.

916
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,810
Think about this palace.

917
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,540
Two years of enduring humiliation

918
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,910
For the Great Cause

919
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,710
Gotta get out of this thing.

920
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:45,210
I never thought about becoming a king.

921
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,020
The Puppet King is even more

922
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,490
but

923
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,570
There is only one reason to enter this palace

924
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,290
To stop running away

925
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,350
Don't let me escape anymore.

926
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,630
I will never run away again

927
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,920
I will search this palace all over again

928
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,890
I will definitely find the Red Moon.

929
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,110
She was obviously imprisoned in the palace.

930
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,940
Because only in this way can

931
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,440
Go punish Yipin immediately

932
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,790
Until I find it out

933
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,410
Please wait for a moment.

934
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,360
knew

935
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,140
but

936
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,680
Finally, I'll show up

937
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,430
By then, none of you should step forward.

938
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,850
This is the imperial order

939
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,360
Too many people have been lost.

940
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,960
I today

941
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,560
I don't want to lose anyone.

942
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,250
Your Highness

943
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,340
Absolutely no injuries

944
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,780
Won't get hurt

945
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,900
Whether they bow their heads as they wish

946
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,660
Or confession of injustice?

947
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,730
I will try my best not to get hurt.

948
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,470
Your Highness

949
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,370
All

950
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,950
Lift your spirits

951
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,630
Today we are looking for a child

952
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,420
The location is the palace

953
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,300
More silent than ever

954
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,980
Pay special attention

955
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,670
It's damn cool.

956
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,790
So boring, nothing to do?

957
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,050
Niangniang

958
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,420
I got this from the palace a few days ago.

959
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,370
Silk thread from the Qing Dynasty

960
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,890
Do you carry this every day?

961
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,090
Because thinking

962
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,520
I don't know when the queen will find her original interest again.

963
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:38,820
Excuse me

964
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:39,830
no thank you

965
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,770
Needlework means pricking your hands with needles.

966
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,800
so

967
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,800
I'm ready

968
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,180
Are you scolding me now?

969
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,380
Why is this considered insulting?

970
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,880
Do you want to eat something, madam?

971
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,000
Choi Sang-Gong

972
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,700
You really don't know what this means?

973
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,060
Honglian, are you too?

974
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,710
What does this finger sleeve mean?

975
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,860
Just to make you

976
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,120
Prepared to avoid pricking your fingers

977
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,740
I feel uncomfortable.

978
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,010
Your Highness

979
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,360
I'm worried

980
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,130
Shangshan arrived first

981
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,530
To maintain the king's dignity,

982
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,620
It's a bit late

983
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,630
Is the nave inside?

984
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,220
Out to the lake.

985
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,450
Why go to the lake?

986
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,500
What you said is true

987
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:59,330
It is no different from what the Lord said.

988
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,920
That night

989
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,930
I couldn't see the nave.

990
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,510
I just heard a loud noise and ran away.

991
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,850
I don't know if I'm telling the truth.

992
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:16,910
The woman seen by the servants carrying the treasures

993
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,690
It should be the real Yipin.

994
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,170
Is still being no touch by the nave

995
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,850
And troubled?

996
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,630
Even the wings haven't spread yet

997
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,140
Concubine

998
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,030
Now Yipin is in Tongming Palace

999
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,840
I

1000
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,780
To protect His Highness

1001
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,500
I found it myself.

1002
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,620
It seems better than expected

1003
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,760
Cherish the child Hongyue even more

1004
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,110
That's perfect.

1005
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,820
Things have become easier.

1006
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,120
Now that I'm here

1007
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,460
Let her speak for herself.

1008
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,480
There is nothing more urgent than health.

1009
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,350
Wait and eat first.

1010
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,220
This is the correct word.

1011
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:17,380
Very dazed

1012
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:22,170
I'm not the kind of person who talks nonsense.

1013
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,210
Even if you kill me

1014
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:28,050
The facts won't change.

1015
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,690
So pitiful

1016
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,150
You look like you're going to kill me and eat me

1017
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,670
Like a dog lying under the hands of its master.

1018
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,830
It's too late for you to confess now.

1019
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,230
Your master has already given the prisoner's identity

1020
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,350
Push it on you

1021
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,980
How is it possible?

1022
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:04,330
Come

1023
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,410
Well done

1024
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,350
Come

1025
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,690
Such a precious thing

1026
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,730
Because it's too precious. That's the problem.

1027
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,190
Too fragile.

1028
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,900
There is nothing

1029
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,280
Is there a strong and resilient line?

1030
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,200
Give up the false self

1031
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,840
Give up the false self

1032
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,080
This is

1033
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,480
The queen embroidered it as soon as she had time not long ago.

1034
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:50,040
I am illiterate and don't know what it means

1035
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,850
But it must be a beautiful poem

1036
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,130
I haven't seen it

1037
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,030
It's strange that Choi Sang-Gong embroidered something else when she came.

1038
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,270
A love poem, right?

1039
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,340
This is a suicide note

1040
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,230
I was embroidering this before I fell into the lake, right?

1041
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,200
yes

1042
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,850
Am I still like this?

1043
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,160
Can't sleep or eat

1044
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,030
Yeah, I keep sighing.

1045
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,630
My face has always been bad

1046
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,020
Sometimes I cry

1047
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,580
Madam, you finally remembered

1048
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,340
no

1049
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,040
Have I

1050
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,860
Give the things you like to the people around you.

1051
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,880
Isn't this what my mother gave me?

1052
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,480
I particularly like

1053
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,250
Gave Choi Sang-Gong a ring

1054
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,030
Not Zhao Huazhen

1055
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,090
Kim So-yong didn't mean to frame Jo Hwa-jin

1056
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,290
It's suicide

1057
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,950
Isn't that Cheoljong?

1058
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,370
Your Highness has arrived

1059
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,510
Didn't they say the king can't run?

1060
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,670
As soon as I saw that face my blood pressure went up again

1061
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,830
What? You want a fight?

1062
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,190
Have a fight

1063
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,490
Is this it?

1064
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,670
Is this the choice of the middle temple?

1065
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,990
What happened suddenly?

1066
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,030
Are you pretending not to know again?

1067
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,380
I was deceived by the false eyes and words of the middle temple.

1068
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,240
Did you cheat?

1069
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,310
The one who has been deceiving is not me but you

1070
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,490
I didn't even know you were going to kill me.

1071
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,990
The one who sleeps in the same room with you

1072
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,880
The one who should be angry is me, not you.

1073
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,530
The Middle Temple said

1074
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,980
How despicable it is to hit the weakest being

1075
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,750
If it's revenge

1076
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,430
So if you choose the same method

1077
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,400
I won't just watch.

1078
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,230
What are you saying?

1079
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:20,100
What

1080
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,740
What should I do with her?

1081
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,210
This weak and stupid child

1082
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,790
The King and the Concubine

1083
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:07,290
If you want to ask for guilt, ask myself.

1084
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,640
I ask whose fault it is that you say such things.

1085
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,660
The maid Hongyue I brought with me disappeared

1086
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,810
I did it? Why?

1087
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,130
Because I heard some words

1088
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:29,230
I'll tell you what you want to hear.

1089
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,500
Then say it

1090
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,070
The moment the nave fell into the lake

1091
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,140
I'm with her

1092
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:47,710
You will lose the people you cherish.

1093
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,830
I was moved by a moment of emotion

1094
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,570
Pushed the nave into the lake

1095
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,550
So ask me about my sin.

1096
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,710
Don't take your anger out on innocent people.

1097
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:34,340
I am solely responsible for the sins I committed

1098
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,850
Yeah

1099
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,420
Do you know the content of this letter?

1100
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,510
This is the letter you received from Queen Jo.

1101
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,790
It was taken out by someone called Hongyue

1102
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,680
The place and time mentioned in this letter

1103
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,130
This is consistent with the incident in the middle temple.

1104
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,980
What does this mean?

1105
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:10,160
I haven't received such a letter.

1106
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:16,240
Do you think you can cover this up?

1107
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,940
Do you think you are amazing?

1108
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,100
You're just the tail.

1109
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,380
The King and the Concubine

1110
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,230
That letter must be fake.

1111
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,000
How can it be fake?

1112
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,590
The same family, the queen and the concubine

1113
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,480
Isn't it natural to have the same goal?

1114
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:45,000
The Queen Mother will not be like this just because she is from the same family

1115
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,840
To be involved in such a vicious thing

1116
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,190
So who forged this letter?

1117
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,500
It turns out that a background is needed

1118
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,230
In order to implement the plan more smoothly

1119
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,690
Your Highness has arrived

1120
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,070
Your Highness

1121
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,590
The King and the Concubine

1122
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,960
Just in time

1123
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,750
Yipin just surrendered herself

1124
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,150
Said he pushed the nave into the lake

1125
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,500
That's a lie

1126
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,960
My Lord, please respect yourself

1127
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,900
No matter how much I like this woman,

1128
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,270
So no judgement

1129
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,400
How can I trust you with the imperial court?

1130
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,930
Is Your Highness shielding this murderer now?

1131
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,150
She killed His Highness's wife, the Empress Dowager

1132
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,740
Explain yourself

1133
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,700
Who is the person who wants to harm the middle temple?

1134
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,800
It's me

1135
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,000
Did you hear that?

1136
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,530
If you really want to argue that I was lying

1137
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,480
Give you a chance to prove

1138
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,860
Visitors

1139
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,520
Already got the recognition you wanted

1140
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:01,800
What to do now

1141
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:05,230
When the order comes, let him be a witness.

1142
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:10,080
What happened

1143
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,270
Chase

1144
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,440
If I plead guilty here now

1145
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:02,470
I won't doubt the authenticity of the concubine.

1146
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:16,400
Cheoljong's dream every day is beheading

1147
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:21,250
Completely frozen.

1148
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,600
I'm telling the truth

1149
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,020
I accept the order of the Queen Mother.

1150
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,000
It's not Concubine Yi who should confess

1151
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,460
Your Highness

1152
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,340
Please

1153
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,470
Do you want to disobey the imperial decree?

1154
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:46,020
Cheoljong is so handsome

1155
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,530
Why do you pretend to be handsome?

1156
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:00,430
The lake will be filled tonight.

1157
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,200
I can go back.

1158
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,430
The force that wants to harm the middle temple is

1159
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:06,970
Wait

1160
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,350
What's wrong

1161
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,760
There is no water

1162
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:37,350
What

1163
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,520
If we keep filling it up like this, the well may dry up.

1164
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,390
Oops, it's over.

1165
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:52,480
It's over. I'm dead.

1166
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,440
As a party to the incident, I will reveal the truth

1167
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:40,550
I want to commit suicide

1168
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,120
Do you think I'll let you show off?

1169
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,350
I am the hero here

1170
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,040
I just need to go back and it's over.

1171
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:05,140
So we can't let innocent people bleed.

1172
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:12,430
So handsome

1173
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:35,310
(Preview of the next episode)

1174
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,840
Yongping Jun led his army to attack

1175
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,690
They are all specially trained people.

1176
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:58,130
If you have any problem, just dig it out.

1177
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,760
The well is dry

1178
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:04,500
I used to believe that giving up on you would make you happy

1179
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:08,190
How dare you look at me with such a sarcastic look?

1180
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:13,560
The request to depose the empress due to the mental state of the empress

1181
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,330
Now it's time to get back to where we are.
