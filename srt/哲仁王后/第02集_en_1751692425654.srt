1
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,610
(The characters in this play are purely fictional
Group events, etc. have nothing to do with history)

2
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,470
no

3
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,130
No, that's not what I meant.

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,600
There is no choice but to use the last resort

5
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,510
Very fast

6
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,260
What's going on?

7
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,820
You are what's wrong

8
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,610
I just feel that this leisurely moonlight

9
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,180
It's suitable for drinking, so I asked you to come

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,360
No, I just...

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,630
(Episode 2)
No, I just...

12
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:21,760
(Episode 2)

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,860
I want to warm up before I drink it.
(Episode 2)

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,330
I want to warm up before I drink it.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,720
It can also be said to be preparation for exercise

16
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,610
uh-huh

17
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,420
Is that so?

18
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,830
What are you doing now?

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,620
Didn't you say we should warm each other's throats?

20
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,590
Insidious guy

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,100
Is this intentional?

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,280
How is that possible?

23
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:14,582
Well, now my throat is open.

24
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,459
You can drink the nave

25
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:21,955
What's the point of drinking alone?

26
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,076
Um

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,730
I didn't expect so much.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,920
good

29
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,470
Thanks to the preparation exercise

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
The wine is very soothing

31
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,620
What

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,560
So what were you doing before?

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,940
Come drink more

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,670
Give

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,260
Drink more in the middle hall too.

36
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,060
Wang first drinks

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,210
Drink first in the middle hall

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,690
This guy has changed his strategy.

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,850
How can I not know your evil heart?

40
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,590
Then let's drink a glass each in friendship

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,130
You are so tired today, go to bed quickly

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,630
What are you talking about? It's just the beginning.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,540
Don't do this

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,540
Come Come

45
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,550
A bit more manly, a bit more cute

46
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,610
One mouthful

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
One mouthful

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,410
I am more sensitive when I sleep.

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,090
Please stay away from me.

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,940
What the hell is that?

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,850
(Rising during the day and setting at night)

52
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,790
Um

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,660
The true face of the king known for his greed, wine and women

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,990
It turns out that it was just a small rumor in the Annals of Joseon Kings.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,450
I was scared for nothing.

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,050
But even so, we cannot let our guard down.

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,650
The cross knot method learned in the military

58
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Finally it's useful

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,570
Want to take off my clothes

60
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,350
Just cut the belt

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,270
OK

62
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,620
This selfish boy

63
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,890
Sleeping alone on warm bedding

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,220
nave

65
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't know how you feel.

66
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,390
But I just want to get some good sleep tonight

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,800
No, it's not like that.

68
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,990
I look more delicate

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,790
Can't sleep on the floor

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,180
Give me a quilt.

71
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,640
Even if one of the three quilts is missing

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,950
I can't sleep either

73
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,200
No matter how delicate you are, can you be more delicate than Wang Jiao?

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
Really good at pretending

75
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,200
A mere exile from Ganghwa Island

76
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,300
I wish you sleep paralysis tonight

77
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,240
It's come to this

78
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,080
I won't sleep tonight.

79
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,900
It really reminds me of the summer army.

80
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,290
(No one knows about Episode 2)

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,420
You're up, lady.

82
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,780
Damn

83
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,590
I'm still thinking about it

84
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,030
I'm back here after all.

85
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,590
How did your first day as a Middle Temple feel?

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,700
It's so disgusting.

87
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,840
What's this

88
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,010
My cross knot

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,850
What have you lost again?

90
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,470
Let the younger one go this time... No thanks

91
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,060
I must have felt too stuffy after falling asleep.

92
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,390
You solved it yourself.

93
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,690
Your Highness

94
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,490
When did you get up?

95
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,300
I don't know, I'm really scared.

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,170
I am afraid that it will disturb my sleep in the central hall.

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,630
Then it became quiet.

98
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
You're having a nightmare again?

99
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,960
How can the middle palace have trouble sleeping because of me?

100
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,260
This is her first day as a princess.

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,740
I'll make you some sleep-inducing tea tonight.

102
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,460
The nave should now

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,420
Say hello to the lady in waiting

104
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,140
I heard she has just left.

105
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,150
I'm curious about what the central palace will look like in the future.

106
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,230
It would have been fine if the ceremony was held yesterday

107
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,730
But why am I so busy today when I open my eyes?

108
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,140
You are going to give a gift to the Queen Mother today.

109
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,800
And the Queen Mother greets you

110
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,380
Then accept the greetings from the court officials.

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,590
After the official ceremony,

112
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,400
Is the national wedding the end?

113
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,540
No

114
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,290
His Majesty will also issue

115
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,100
The Princess's Decree

116
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,900
This wedding is really endless

117
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,760
Wait a moment

118
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,050
The Queen Mother's words

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,100
This is an order from the Queen Mother herself.

120
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,990
If I really did that

121
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,790
Isn't that going against her wishes?

122
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,150
What kind of person is the Queen Mother?

123
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,960
The Queen Mother is the same as the Queen Mother

124
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,870
Born in the Andong Kim family

125
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,050
The Queen Mother is from the Pungyang Jo clan

126
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,680
Um

127
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,950
Mother-in-law and grandmother are rivals

128
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,690
Grandma and I are in the same group.

129
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,790
You can tell by just looking at her appearance, right?

130
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,070
The oldest one must be the Queen Mother.

131
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,020
And what else

132
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,970
This is very important to me.

133
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,240
Tell me everything you know

134
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,670
She is the elder sister of Master Jin Zuogen

135
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,370
After entering the palace, he never left the palace

136
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,010
Meanwhile... Stop

137
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,570
No, I mean the sedan.

138
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,700
stop

139
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,450
stop

140
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,930
Stop the car

141
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,830
Back, back, back, back

142
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,770
Back, Back, Back

143
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,760
later

144
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,300
That's it.

145
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,420
Now there's something more important

146
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,960
Is it because the road to the palace is too complicated?

147
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,080
Let you get lost

148
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,830
First meeting

149
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,240
What is your last name...

150
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,460
I really am

151
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,670
I'm not used to this body yet.

152
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,740
I think you have an extraordinary temperament

153
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,590
Are you also from the Wang family?

154
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,530
Murphy

155
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,020
What princess?

156
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,570
The little girl is terrified

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,110
If my daughter's attitude is too arrogant

158
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,050
You're not happy, ma'am.

159
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,400
Please forgive me

160
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,080
No, no

161
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,730
What I mean is

162
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,460
Niangniang

163
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,220
How come you walk so fast?

164
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,620
We've come this far

165
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,180
Hello

166
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,120
You know

167
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,570
She is the one that His Majesty wants to take into the harem this time.

168
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,220
Miss Huazhen from Mr. Zhao's family

169
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,580
No matter how she is the Queen Mother

170
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,320
I really underestimate you, miss.

171
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,680
She has no manners at all.

172
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,950
The rumor in the palace was that the queen had fallen into the lake.

173
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,480
That lady too.

174
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,490
Miss, it is said that the Queen has lost her memory

175
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,700
They are all fake

176
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,870
You have to be careful with her. You have to be careful with her.

177
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,510
Um

178
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,470
Me

179
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,510
After all, I have dealt with too many women.

180
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,110
So I'll look at the face.

181
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,800
How would you say it?

182
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,270
Good Guy

183
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,850
The past between you and me may not be very good

184
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,560
Are we going to start over?

185
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,350
I like you very much

186
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,660
Get along well in the future

187
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,300
Have you decided to change your approach?

188
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,310
way

189
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,380
Thanks to

190
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,430
I already know where this place is.

191
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,590
Now I finally have a sense of reality about entering the palace

192
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,090
No, no

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,360
You seem to have misunderstood me.

194
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,800
I am... Please forgive my fear.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,910
My little girl first...

196
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,050
Your Highness

197
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,590
His Majesty the Lord

198
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,920
I've gone to another palace.

199
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,170
Didn't see you

200
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,120
My daughter also went to ask you how you are.

201
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,170
I just didn't see you

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,920
Really

203
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,610
We actually went the wrong way

204
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,050
The soul is connected

205
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,730
Harem's words

206
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,750
Is she Cheoljong's second wife?

207
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,970
I really shouldn't be in this body.

208
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,750
Instead, you should get on top of him.

209
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,640
The jealous look of the queen

210
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,000
It scares the shit out of me.

211
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,740
Just go get a room.

212
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,470
nave

213
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,440
I hope you can confer the imperial edict to the harem as soon as possible.

214
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,400
But what to do?

215
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm too busy to confer titles on my harem for now.

216
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,530
This is the imperial order

217
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,770
Screw polygamy.

218
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,470
Niangniang

219
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,610
The ladies in the inner chamber are waiting.

220
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,610
Your Highness

221
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,780
I have something important to attend to, so I'll leave now.

222
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,170
This is really...

223
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,870
Niangniang

224
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,840
You must be terrified.

225
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,250
Huazhen

226
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,850
I can finally marry you.

227
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
I now

228
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,370
I'm going to live in the same palace with His Highness.

229
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
Should have waited until after the official marriage

230
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,980
But in fact

231
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,780
I saw you by the lake before.

232
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,640
Because of the lake incident, everyone said you were responsible.

233
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,890
That's why I'm so anxious to canonize you

234
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,070
I just heard screams from the lake

235
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,360
Just a little shocked

236
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,440
Don't worry

237
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,530
No matter how strong the Anton Jin family is

238
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,320
I can't do anything to you who are innocent.

239
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,440
No

240
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,680
I won't let them do anything to you.

241
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,570
I will risk everything I have to protect you

242
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,360
Your Highness

243
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,290
But I have nothing now

244
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,930
A throne with only a shell

245
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,060
A brother who loves worrying about everything

246
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,040
There is also a friend with a slick face

247
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,050
as well as

248
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,600
A beautiful woman

249
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,650
You are so rich then.

250
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,970
Your whereabouts that day

251
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,010
I've arranged everything.

252
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
Don't worry

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,520
What the hell

254
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,980
Who is the Queen?

255
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,060
Please excuse me, Madam.

256
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,260
I really don't care.

257
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,810
Did you sleep well last night?

258
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,800
The King and the Concubine

259
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,670
You slept really well last night.

260
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,450
It seems like time has been reversed

261
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,220
I almost misunderstood you as the Queen Consort.

262
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,060
This woman

263
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,610
Is it that exaggerated?

264
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,390
Then my efforts were not in vain.

265
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,310
very good

266
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,500
Very natural

267
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,560
Such an unfortunate accident happened

268
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,960
oops

269
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,990
It seems that the body has not recovered yet.

270
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,110
Still don't understand after reading it?

271
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,110
This is the perfect nave posture.

272
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,860
The eyesight is still so good

273
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,090
Um

274
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,800
Really?

275
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,010
Smiling with a calm face

276
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,030
But secretly suppressing each other

277
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,030
Looks like I have to be more alert.

278
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,500
Now I only have to worry about the aftermath.

279
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,370
Yeah, I've heard of it before.

280
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,720
What is the secret of conceiving a prince that has been passed down from generation to generation in the palace?

281
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,820
Yeah

282
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,180
That is

283
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,220
When the palace

284
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,460
Let the Lord lie down first

285
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
Then put the master's...

286
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,180
What kind of a life is this?

287
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,190
Then at the climax

288
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,680
The middle temple gave the body to...

289
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,390
Mother-in-law, I'll take care of it myself.

290
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,780
I couldn't help it

291
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,320
I am also quite accomplished in that area.

292
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,350
That's right

293
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,410
I was studying the Middle Temple class very hard before.

294
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,220
You must be fully prepared.

295
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,630
Is that so?

296
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,790
I'm interfering too much in your affairs.

297
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,130
Although I don't like my daughter-in-law is B-level

298
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,650
But I am very happy with myself

299
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,580
The daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law is B-level

300
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,450
The hem is so big

301
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,750
It's really exhausting.

302
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,830
My head hurts

303
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,910
You look tired

304
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,610
But last night was too much of a stretch.

305
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,540
I just drank a little bit of wine.

306
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,610
The minister is still waiting.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
Come in now

308
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,060
(Injeongjeon)

309
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,740
Kim Byung-hak

310
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,770
I wish Your Highness a happy wedding.

311
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,390
Zuo Yizheng Jin Shijun congratulates you

312
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,850
Kim Chang-hyup, Minister of Military Affairs

313
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,680
Congratulations

314
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,520
Rows of Kims

315
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,170
Are they the famous Andong Kim?

316
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,820
Relying on the Queen Mother and the Queen Mother

317
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,830
Because of the collection of various taxes

318
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,550
The people are living in poverty, right?

319
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,870
In modern times, military service is corrupt.

320
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,820
Real estate corruption Tax corruption

321
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,190
All the corruption cases were committed because of the disorder of the three political systems.

322
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,730
Became a symbol of the corrupt politicians who destroyed North Korea

323
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,070
Andong Kim

324
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,850
Right State Councillor Cho Man-hong

325
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,590
Congratulations

326
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,020
Zhao Dewen, the Minister of Personnel

327
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,270
Congratulations

328
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,810
Fengyang Zhaoshi

329
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,670
The family headed by Queen Jo is also very famous.

330
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,210
When the son of Queen Dowager Zhao was in power, Xianzong was very crazy.

331
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,490
After Xianzong's death

332
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,830
Kim So-yong of Andong Kim clan

333
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,910
After becoming the middle temple, he was suppressed.

334
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,440
There should be others besides these little ones.

335
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,330
The giant of this era

336
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,610
Training General Kim Jakeun

337
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,500
Congratulations to your Highness and the Queen Mother.

338
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,120
The people in power in the Kim family

339
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,850
I would like to take this opportunity to report something on this auspicious day.

340
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,110
What is

341
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,730
The Royal Guards General who protects His Highness's comfort

342
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,370
How about appointing Kim Moon-geun as the king's uncle?

343
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,670
Do you mean father-in-law?

344
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,210
Yes

345
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,760
How could such an important matter happen so suddenly?

346
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,350
Because the Queen is very worried about His Highness

347
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,970
So I am more anxious

348
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,680
Did you ask him to do this yourself?

349
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,520
Although I don't know

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,590
But be on the winning side

351
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,620
Because I am concerned about the safety of the Lord even if I am dead.

352
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,730
Otherwise how could it be possible

353
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,660
I have to work the night shift even during my sleep time.

354
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,500
Do you still need to ask?

355
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,060
Got it, I'll consider it.

356
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,720
The Queen Dowager also praised the Queen

357
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,590
Now my brother, Yongping Jun, is here

358
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,810
Give me some time to think about it.

359
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,560
There is nothing more urgent than your highness's safety.

360
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,000
Please understand our wishes.

361
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,310
His Majesty the Lord

362
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,300
You are really worried about my safety.

363
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,570
So

364
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,390
I started executing

365
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Possessing great power

366
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,230
Kim Jageun is more powerful than the king

367
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,560
he

368
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,920
The real head of this court

369
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,090
This is simply the rhythm of popcorn.

370
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,000
oops

371
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,240
Nave...

372
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,630
sorry

373
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,420
You continue

374
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,860
The nave looks tired

375
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,270
How about continuing the ceremony?

376
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,240
Sexual intercourse is a major event for the sake of offspring

377
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,980
It's not enough to just think about feelings and happiness

378
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,770
I didn't respect myself last night.

379
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,920
A good relationship between husband and wife is not something to be criticized

380
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,070
Yeah

381
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,850
What is he talking about?

382
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Let's continue the ceremony.

383
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,790
Your Majesty the Holy Lord Your Majesty the Holy Lord

384
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,010
Are you pretending?

385
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,040
What are you talking about

386
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,610
Nothing happened last night

387
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,070
it's a pity

388
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,100
Even if I drink

389
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,150
I actually forgot the first night that only comes once in a lifetime

390
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,820
What are you talking about?

391
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,970
I understand that you also lost your memory not long ago.

392
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,420
It's probably a sequelae.

393
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,620
impossible

394
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,260
Absolutely impossible

395
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,750
The test is red

396
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,820
What is red test?

397
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,860
Confirming the blood stains on the futon from the first night

398
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,960
I have other plans, so I'll leave now.

399
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,360
Hello

400
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,540
That's it, then leave.

401
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,920
Niangniang

402
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,920
Please get in the sedan

403
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,090
Don't be afraid that he is lying.

404
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,210
you

405
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,670
You thought that happened to you

406
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,610
Don't know yet?

407
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,410
Absolutely impossible.

408
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,120
It would be bad if the king is not good in some aspect.

409
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,730
Plus, they love to distort history.

410
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,000
But is this something that should be watertight?

411
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,950
Do you still need to forge a red test or something?

412
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,220
Wait a minute, stop the car

413
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,010
that

414
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,990
woman

415
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,370
Finish those

416
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,720
Is it possible that you don't even know it?

417
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,580
That?

418
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,380
What do you mean when you do something?

419
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,790
A face that looks ignorant

420
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,170
The palace lady who is more abstinent than an old monk

421
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,120
Why

422
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,030
I really don't have anyone to ask here.

423
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,340
Oh my god

424
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,730
Let's go, let's go.

425
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,490
She cried because she saw me.

426
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,660
How is it possible?

427
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,730
It's cool, close the window

428
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,070
I feel hot and sweaty.

429
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,120
Very cool

430
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,310
I'm going to catch a cold.

431
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,490
I'm hot

432
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,400
Let's go

433
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Well, it's because of what Cheoljong said.

434
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,190
I feel so sad.

435
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,260
You can eat it now

436
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,770
After seeing it with my own eyes today, I found

437
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,500
The situation in the middle hall is really not good.

438
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,870
What can I say?

439
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,080
It should be said that he is too ignorant.

440
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,070
Although there is a capable side

441
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,970
But he is not such an ignorant child.

442
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,070
During the ceremony

443
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,300
It also seems like he hasn't recovered yet.

444
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,930
We need to correct the behavior of the middle temple.

445
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,070
There is no need to give others unnecessary handles

446
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,870
But Zhao Huazhen that night

447
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,300
Are you really together with the Lord?

448
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,310
Yes

449
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,570
The concubine's behavior is correct

450
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,830
One moment interval
(One moment is about fifteen minutes)

451
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:16,850
(One moment is about fifteen minutes)

452
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,180
The time when the accident happened
(One moment is about fifteen minutes)

453
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,490
The time when the accident happened

454
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,220
Inconsistent with the time of entering the palace

455
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
Of course this can't be

456
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,600
This is direct evidence that she harmed the Empress.

457
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,250
But they should want to take advantage of this.

458
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,570
It's really confusing

459
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,780
If it wasn't her, who was it?

460
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,890
Are there any other forces?

461
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,510
Possibly

462
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,620
But what is more important to us

463
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,590
Not who it is

464
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,420
It's who should be

465
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,010
Who do you mean?

466
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,470
Calling a Deer a Horse

467
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,370
(Pointing at a deer and calling it a horse - pointing at a deer and saying it is a horse)
Calling a Deer a Horse

468
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,880
(Pointing at a deer and calling it a horse - pointing at a deer and saying it is a horse)

469
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,520
We point to a deer and say it's a horse.
(Pointing at a deer and calling it a horse - pointing at a deer and saying it is a horse)

470
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,700
We point to a deer and say it's a horse.

471
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,720
It has to be a horse

472
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,720
Our words

473
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,680
In the future, that deer may really turn into a horse.

474
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,870
Come

475
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,950
Don't think about these political matters first.

476
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,990
Please eat, ma'am.

477
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,770
My brother personally takes care of my meal

478
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,190
I don't want to pay attention to my health.

479
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,660
I will never let it go.

480
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,270
Please

481
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,580
Zhao Huazhen, daughter of Zhao Dashou, deputy heir of the Pungyang Zhao clan

482
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,830
Named as the First-rank Concubine of the Imperial Household

483
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,320
In addition, its beauty and character are highly praised

484
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,110
The title bestowed upon Concubine Yi

485
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,980
Phong Ngan Cho

486
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,210
Regardless of family or status

487
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,710
This woman is my enemy

488
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,070
Did you really push Kim So-yong into the lake?

489
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,480
Dangerous Woman

490
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,570
More attractive

491
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,460
Holy Grace

492
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,340
Let's get along

493
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,960
Although I should be on the winning side

494
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,280
Such a beauty belongs in the demilitarized zone

495
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,620
We need to live in harmony

496
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,200
After a while you will find

497
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,910
I am a perfect person

498
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,790
In addition to many disadvantages

499
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,960
Now we are a family that eats from one pot

500
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,790
Can I ask you a question?

501
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,610
I have no one to ask here.

502
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,230
I have many shortcomings

503
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,530
I don't know if I can give you a perfect answer.

504
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,260
Yeah, that's what you're good at.

505
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,670
It's about His Majesty the Lord.

506
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,900
Your Highness

507
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,810
Are you a bit of a liar?

508
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,360
It's not about women.

509
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,510
Can you say anything?

510
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,860
so

511
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,070
Your Highness, isn't it true that Bai Ying loses at night?

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
White wins and night loses?

513
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,970
This is the first time I've heard this.

514
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,880
That means you win during the day.

515
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,600
The kind that folds down at night

516
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,330
But I told others

517
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,820
After a hot night of lies

518
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,940
There is also a tendency to distort what happened that night

519
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,760
Niangniang

520
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,060
Sorry, I shouldn't say that.

521
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,530
I'm sorry if you feel unhappy.

522
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,220
Because I feel bad

523
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,670
Because I just moved to the palace yesterday

524
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,940
A lot of things to do

525
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,310
I'm holding a busy man. Sorry.

526
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,050
Go ahead

527
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,390
So

528
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,080
good

529
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,890
And His Royal Highness

530
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,020
Not that kind of person

531
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,750
Not that kind of person.

532
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,220
I mean, I'm not a liar.

533
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,060
Or someone who can't do it at night

534
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,910
Um

535
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,320
I feel even more unhappy

536
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,800
Oh my god

537
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,770
Little Thief

538
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,290
Thief

539
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,540
Thief

540
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,570
Thief Thief

541
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,160
Thief Thief

542
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,250
Thief catches thief

543
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Don't cry.

544
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,440
Don't cry

545
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,030
Children Children

546
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,940
no

547
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,890
Your Highness

548
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,170
There are no items in the secret warehouse this time.

549
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,280
If there is not minimal access by outsiders

550
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,830
The place with the least security

551
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,730
Is it really hidden in the tiger's mouth?

552
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,710
Your Highness

553
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,790
The Queen Mother Arrives

554
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,070
I am busy with politics now.

555
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,320
We have the same topic.

556
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,960
I also happened to have that problem

557
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,580
How busy I am that I don't even have time to get the correct answer.

558
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,910
I have a lot of thoughts because of something

559
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,810
You keep thinking.

560
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,630
I'm waiting

561
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,170
Why do you look at me like that?

562
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,630
no

563
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,300
I think you're really bothered.

564
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,840
It is natural for a king to be concerned about political affairs.

565
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,430
Is this guy always talking about politics on purpose?

566
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,150
Now that your dream of becoming a concubine has come to an end,

567
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,080
Let's sleep in the annex palace from tonight

568
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,330
OK

569
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,800
Don't you have anything to say to me?

570
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,620
You found it.

571
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,760
Don't you have something to say?

572
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,400
After all, there are only two of us

573
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,950
Now let's be honest.

574
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,800
Last night we

575
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,990
Had a wonderful time

576
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,300
OK

577
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,500
You must say this

578
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Really

579
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,920
It hinders me.

580
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,200
I'm embarrassed to say it out loud

581
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,020
How about a gesture that's just for the two of us?

582
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,800
Like this

583
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,220
What's this

584
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,760
What I'm saying now is a lie

585
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,170
That's what I mean

586
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,900
How is it not difficult?

587
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,700
The king does not lie

588
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,410
Back off

589
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,800
so annoying

590
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,180
Always so serious

591
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,170
It's like something really happened.

592
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,240
It was hard today.

593
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,030
Very itchy

594
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,010
Very itchy

595
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,310
Very itchy

596
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,410
Niangniang

597
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,840
Start etiquette lessons today

598
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,270
No one is as polite as me.

599
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,960
This is

600
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,800
Palace etiquette training

601
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,200
I don't want

602
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,510
This is the order of the Queen Mother.

603
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,780
Regardless of whether or not to go back later is the most urgent thing.

604
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,750
It is right to cater to the Queen Mother

605
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,600
Don't look at me like this

606
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,830
I was 4 years old.

607
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,060
People trained at Cheonghakdong etiquette school

608
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,600
Highest level learned

609
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,150
Shall I show you?

610
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,680
The so-called Wang family woman

611
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,150
The posture is the same as the ruler

612
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,200
Walking without wind

613
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,330
Can't let the candlelight waver

614
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,180
Meal time

615
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,790
Can't open your mouth wide

616
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,260
You can't take big bites of food.

617
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,550
Correct a woman's inner

618
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,540
Only embroidery

619
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,570
Embroidery

620
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,210
This was originally the Empress's specialty.

621
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,110
(I'm not being rude)

622
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,250
(But you guys have too much etiquette, don’t you?!)

623
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,960
(This makes people stop breathing!)

624
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,990
(How can it be more exaggerated than Qinghe Cave!)

625
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,150
How can I eat these?

626
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,630
These are not eaten with the mouth but with the eyes

627
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,310
Looks like he's eating it on purpose

628
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,930
It's because of my mood.

629
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,340
This is what my wife liked to eat.

630
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,070
Honglian, you too

631
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,140
What's wrong, my lady?

632
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,020
In the memory of this woman, Kim So-yong

633
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,460
Heart and...

634
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,300
It's poison

635
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,230
Call the imperial physician quickly

636
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,630
MILF

637
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,900
Spit it out, my lady.

638
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,070
Niangniang

639
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,240
This is not sick

640
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,730
This woman

641
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,120
Do you like Cheoljong?

642
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,420
You have to love me

643
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,470
That look

644
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,710
It's beyond disgust.

645
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,630
Please, my lady.

646
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,000
Please

647
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,580
I prefer snacks to wine.

648
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,870
Just right

649
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,500
All the wine here is yours.

650
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,340
From the beginning, Cheoljong had no intention of spending his virginity with him

651
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,170
That's why you made me drink.

652
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,580
Played the same trick as me.

653
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,790
Now the only thing left is to worry about the heirs.

654
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,130
Cheer up, my lady.

655
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,030
Bring water

656
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,850
In order to deceive and instigate the Jin family forces in the palace, Cheoljong

657
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,590
Lied

658
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,190
red lotus

659
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,710
Nothing happened to me

660
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,010
I really feel super uncomfortable.

661
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,200
Although I believe in myself

662
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,680
But I don't trust that guy.

663
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,450
but

664
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,920
What are you doing?

665
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,120
Try harder

666
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,600
Pull up again

667
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:33,690
yes

668
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,500
Maintaining your position is such a hard thing

669
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,520
Because the appearance of aging means being weaker

670
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,020
If you do this twice a day

671
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,200
Can prevent wrinkles from deepening

672
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,940
yes

673
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,080
You've worked hard

674
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,610
But what's your matter?

675
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,050
Took etiquette lessons

676
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,610
What to do as a nave

677
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,430
I learned a lot

678
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,370
I am very happy

679
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,660
Okay, stop it.

680
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,670
yes

681
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,780
But last night when the palace

682
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,560
Feeling mentally deficient for no apparent reason

683
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,710
I can't muster any strength

684
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,830
I thought about the reason and the answer is...

685
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,700
The lake in the palace is all gone.

686
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,060
It turns out that the taste has become weaker

687
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,420
As long as the lake is filled

688
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,530
It seems like she can get pregnant with a prince soon.

689
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,920
no

690
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,700
hateful

691
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,990
You nearly lost your life in the lake.

692
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,130
According to the original words

693
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,030
It is not enough to execute all the assistants to the nave.

694
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,450
But because the good things of the ceremony are approaching

695
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,040
I didn't do this because it was wrong to see blood.

696
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,310
If you really want to fill up the lake

697
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,360
Let’s proceed in a continuous manner.

698
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,760
The child named Honglian and Choi Sang-Gong

699
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,960
Who else is coming?

700
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,880
Responsible Owner

701
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,540
Under heavy penalty

702
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,020
Spooky

703
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,800
Sure enough, he is not an ordinary person

704
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,070
Conjunction Palace 3rd

705
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,370
In order to conceive a prince as soon as possible, the palace will be closed immediately

706
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,030
If you can fill it with water as a gift

707
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:18,960
7th

708
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,860
5th

709
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,500
Visitors

710
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,180
Those who assist the middle temple will be severely punished...

711
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,980
7th

712
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,560
Just right

713
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,020
If it is agreed that the water will be filled after 7 days

714
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,940
I will definitely get pregnant with the prince.

715
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,300
No matter you are the prince or something

716
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,940
I just need to leave and that's it.

717
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,980
She has already drunk the tea

718
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,650
As heard

719
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,690
The temperament is indeed different

720
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,290
Our Lord

721
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,710
He has a keen eye for women.

722
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,000
You're flattered.

723
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,790
It's a gift

724
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,360
This is necessary for life in the palace.

725
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,240
Very important items

726
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,200
Open it and have a look

727
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,810
This is what palace life is like.

728
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,190
Not as expected

729
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,660
If you start to feel uneasy

730
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,640
Will be endlessly uneasy

731
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:00,950
That's right.

732
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,750
What is the exact birthday?

733
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,320
What should I do if I want to give birth to a prince?

734
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,810
Look at my spirit

735
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,640
The most important thing is to be compatible with the master.

736
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,360
if

737
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,410
If you need a very powerful spell, please tell me.

738
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,800
Among the Bodhisattvas I know

739
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,770
There is a special curse

740
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,070
Last time I tried it out...

741
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,980
Concubine

742
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,280
A little fear

743
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,550
I only entered the palace to assist His Highness.

744
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,350
It's me

745
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,130
Don't know what's good for you

746
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,700
The little one is terrified, Queen Consort

747
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,210
My words and actions were too decisive.

748
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,300
No

749
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,690
Don't Care

750
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,830
Back to the point

751
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,580
One was canonized

752
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,480
The time I spend alone in an empty room becomes longer

753
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,860
What a pity. What can I do?

754
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,680
What

755
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,120
The period of union between the Lord and the Middle Temple

756
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,200
Set for 7 days

757
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,690
No thunder

758
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,570
The conjunction day cannot be foggy or windy.

759
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,530
It was booked for 7 days

760
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,700
Don't worry too much

761
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,060
The Lord loves your heart

762
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,730
How could it change during that time?

763
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,000
You will too

764
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,570
Losing a precious person

765
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,890
Miss

766
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,260
It's too big.

767
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,230
I really have no idea what to do.

768
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,510
Although it's a pity

769
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,690
But it's time to throw it away

770
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,900
Whether it's character or anything else

771
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,950
Our young lady is perfect for being the Queen Mother.

772
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,880
It's obviously not the right material.

773
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,190
Just relying on family background

774
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,300
Just like that, I got attached to His Majesty.

775
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,090
You

776
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,010
The nave is equivalent to another holy

777
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,300
There is a difference between upper and lower

778
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,950
Avoid excessive talk.

779
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,870
but

780
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,740
The Shang Gong clearly faked the He Gong.

781
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,110
And I've done things that the lady hasn't done.

782
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,170
Framed to Miss

783
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,010
Why did it happen when the lady passed by?

784
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,050
That happened

785
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,910
I am still unfamiliar with life in the palace.

786
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,700
This mouth is really

787
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,770
Sorry Miss

788
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,890
For His Highness

789
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,350
What can I do this time?

790
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,230
Passing by the Annex

791
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,230
Let's have the consort marriage through the Queen Dowager

792
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,200
This woman's mind is really difficult.

793
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,070
I have a favor to ask.

794
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:54,950
Can you promise?

795
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,500
Promise

796
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,740
After all, it was the request from the Middle Temple.

797
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,340
We each other

798
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,170
No touch

799
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,110
reject

800
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,240
Didn't you say you would agree?

801
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,630
That has to be based on discretion.

802
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,910
Now I don't even know what I'm saying.

803
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,050
Because I don't know what you are talking about

804
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,340
So refuse

805
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,790
Listen carefully, Your Majesty.

806
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,420
no touch

807
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,870
Let's live happily.

808
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,050
Such a beautiful meaning.

809
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,370
For example,

810
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,710
After saying this,

811
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,020
You go to the other palace to sleep.

812
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,470
I sleep here

813
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,720
So let’s say no touch

814
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,310
Finally refused

815
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,470
Why is it always

816
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,160
Why is your attitude so unhappy?

817
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,530
This mad king

818
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,130
The way to deal with a madman is best known by the madman.

819
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,520
I'm afraid I won't remember it by the evening.

820
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,690
Let’s review it.

821
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,990
Fire Night

822
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,870
OK

823
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,320
Fire Night

824
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,010
Hot Night

825
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,450
today

826
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,150
This is our real first night.

827
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,400
So

828
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,200
Hurry up! Hurry up!

829
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,790
If this continues, we'll be discovered.

830
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,640
The king will never run away.

831
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,810
Choi Sang-Gong

832
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,910
If this continues, something serious will happen, my lady.

833
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,860
To see the suffering of the people with one's own eyes

834
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,440
I can become an excellent princess.

835
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,330
Although the original intention is good

836
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,330
But that's too dangerous.

837
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,860
I listened to you, madam.

838
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,140
If you want to die, you die.

839
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,730
map

840
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,870
But at least this time

841
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,680
famous brand

842
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,040
No matter how much I think about it, it's no use

843
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,210
The name is

844
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,470
Li Shengli

845
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,580
Why is it such an unlucky name?

846
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,670
Examining the people

847
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,500
It is to examine this country and absorb it.

848
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:20,690
What a nice name.

849
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,330
What's wrong

850
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,900
At once

851
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:23,940
OK

852
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,630
It's not really my name anyway.

853
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,250
What time is the curfew?

854
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,590
At midnight

855
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,250
After the night watchman knocked 28 times,

856
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,640
The door will close.

857
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,790
The meaning of ringing the bell is

858
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,500
The midnight is 11 o'clock.

859
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,960
It's golden time.

860
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,090
OK

861
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,800
I will definitely come back then.

862
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,840
No

863
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,670
I don't care what method I use

864
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,990
They will tear apart the empress who is trying to stop you from leaving.

865
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,600
Red Lotus

866
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,750
What kind of person am I?

867
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,740
The queen always

868
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,480
Very kind

869
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,340
Positive attitude towards everything

870
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,590
A lot of smiles

871
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,390
Very kind to people

872
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,960
Compared to hearing from others

873
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,040
It would be better to hear it from you.

874
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,760
Is that so?

875
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,220
So

876
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,120
Once when I was reading a history book

877
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,120
I really can't read this book anymore.

878
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,700
How can you breathe so loudly?

879
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,920
It's just annoying to my ears.

880
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,370
Someone come

881
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,490
Take this guy down and punish him.

882
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,490
I I

883
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,920
Because of rhinitis

884
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,590
Please forgive me, my lady.

885
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,770
Isn't the tempo half a beat slower?

886
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,670
There's no sense of rhythm.

887
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,610
How dare you be a teacher?

888
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,310
Someone come

889
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,040
Take this guy down and punish him.

890
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,760
What should I do?

891
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:32,990
Are you laughing?

892
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,420
It seems like you have an easy life.

893
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,420
Someone come

894
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,540
Take these guys down and punish them.

895
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,440
If you take a breath

896
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,860
I'll ask you where you dare to breathe like this

897
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:44,670
If the aroma is good

898
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,130
I'll ask you where you are and how dare you be so ostentatious

899
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,610
If you make a sound, you will be called noisy.

900
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,100
If you enter the pavilion, people will ask you if you are the king.

901
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,020
Everything big and small

902
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,230
As long as you dare to catch her eye

903
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,100
Will catch it immediately

904
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,400
Anything else

905
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,430
Put in another palace

906
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,260
sorry

907
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,550
For vivid communication

908
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,590
I'm too anxious

909
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,770
The man who would push this woman into the lake

910
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,020
More than one or two.

911
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,460
So just now the palace maids

912
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,670
No one knows your true face, Madam.

913
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,760
Do you know

914
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,660
Of course

915
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,070
The lady I have been watching since I was a child

916
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,200
Very warm in nature

917
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,340
Very smart

918
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,810
As long as you make up your mind, you will accomplish it.

919
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,110
He's a very handsome man.

920
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,740
Just because I entered the palace

921
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,770
Just a little bit lonely

922
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,620
And you can see His Majesty

923
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,970
Being affectionate towards other women

924
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,250
This woman is not someone who needs to feel lonely.

925
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,200
There are people who understand her.

926
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,690
This woman?

927
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,470
Me

928
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,950
Thanks to you, I'm not lonely.

929
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,250
The queen is really

930
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,120
Red Lotus

931
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,900
Don't worry, sleep well.

932
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,000
Even if it's for you

933
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,190
I won't be discovered.

934
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,390
I'm gonna chop you all up.

935
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:15,550
To this extent

936
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,950
You guys take a look at this.

937
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,770
To help my wife and this guy.

938
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,790
I don't care

939
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,620
If you don't have money to pay taxes

940
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,050
Then use your body to resist.

941
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,960
That that that

942
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,860
The guilty guy

943
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,620
If I were guilty

944
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:32,250
That is also the sin of being born into this damned world.

945
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:36,950
Get out of the way

946
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,070
Convict that lunatic of treason.

947
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,240
Killing you guys is treason.

948
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,530
Never mind.

949
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,360
Snail Dad

950
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,320
No way

951
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,760
No matter what

952
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:59,730
They all let us die.

953
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,200
What are you saying?

954
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:49,930
Father

955
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,350
You are back

956
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,330
yes

957
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:53,920
How are the ladies?

958
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,070
For the family's big event

959
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:56,980
Let you make room

960
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,980
I'm really scared.

961
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,610
Have you made up your mind?

962
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,450
Which position do you prefer?

963
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,740
The direction of my dream has been set

964
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,300
But the size of the dream has not yet been determined

965
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,860
Size

966
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,740
All right

967
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,970
I believe you

968
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,820
As soon as possible

969
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,540
In fact

970
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,070
Because you made room

971
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,610
So there is one thing

972
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,560
Empress of the Middle Temple

973
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,630
On the eve of the ceremony, he was pushed into the lake

974
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,040
Because of falling into the lake

975
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,090
Lost consciousness overnight

976
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,680
So the ceremony took place later than scheduled.

977
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,640
How is the lady now?

978
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,420
Are you healthy?

979
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,490
Wait

980
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,630
A face I have never seen in the palace

981
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:00,790
You look so anxious.

982
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,220
that

983
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,050
It's my first time entering the palace

984
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,160
I'm lost.

985
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,390
I was like this at the beginning.

986
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:09,580
yes

987
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,540
But why do you feel a little familiar?

988
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,200
The clothes are so high-end

989
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,280
No wariness towards people

990
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,100
Look at such a confident attitude

991
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,640
Born with a silver spoon in mouth

992
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,920
This is what I should say.

993
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,440
Are you the famous young master?

994
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,360
Not to mention her family background, her appearance is also quite outstanding

995
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,750
This all-round talent

996
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,010
The name that is being rumored everywhere is

997
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:41,880
Kim Hwan

998
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,550
Andong Kim Thi Hwan

999
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,360
relative

1000
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,910
I'm so famous.

1001
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,940
Of course

1002
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,180
The news spread inside and outside the palace.

1003
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,060
It's my honor to meet you like this.

1004
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,800
I'm about to go out.

1005
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,230
Let's go together

1006
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,380
That's the way I came.

1007
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,260
I'm a little dizzy for the moment.

1008
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,530
Disappeared

1009
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,280
So many words

1010
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,860
How can you keep going all the time?

1011
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,880
I understand this fate.

1012
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,130
However

1013
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,720
For the Holy

1014
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,920
It's also a nightmare.

1015
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:26,640
Nightmare

1016
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,620
Your Majesty

1017
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,420
From Ganghwa Island to now

1018
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,900
I keep having the same nightmare

1019
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:34,860
That is

1020
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,480
Devil's neck

1021
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,630
Cut it off

1022
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

1023
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,600
It's not just once or twice.

1024
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,950
As a commemoration of meeting a very good friend today

1025
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,940
I'm thinking about going to a gisaeng house.

1026
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,840
Where is the best place here?

1027
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,520
Utah Pavilion

1028
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,230
That's the best.

1029
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:13,490
The laughter of women

1030
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,540
Just like a nightingale

1031
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,720
Utah Pavilion

1032
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,950
Let's go together

1033
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,330
Look at the bright moon tonight

1034
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,020
Doesn't it mean to enjoy the wind?

1035
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:28,950
yes

1036
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,610
Let's go

1037
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,210
Thanks for your hard work

1038
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,350
yes

1039
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,250
About my age

1040
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,320
Similar interests

1041
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,390
What a great fate.

1042
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,580
That's right

1043
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,530
I still don't know the young master's name.

1044
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:46,900
Name

1045
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,650
My name is Li Shengli

1046
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,600
This life is over.

1047
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,200
This life is over

1048
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,740
Thanks for your hard work

1049
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,470
Not bad, not bad

1050
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,020
sorry

1051
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,120
A woman has arrived.

1052
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,270
What are you talking about?

1053
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,480
To a good man

1054
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,350
us

1055
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,920
They don't accept female guests.

1056
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,310
Children

1057
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,460
The Master has arrived

1058
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,130
It's my honor to meet you.

1059
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,420
I'll pour you a drink.

1060
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,680
I don't drink more than three cups a day.

1061
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,390
It's the second cup

1062
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,370
The last cup should be saved for drinking with friends

1063
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,820
He's a very upright person.

1064
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,940
Our Lord Liu's son passed the exam this time.

1065
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:57,050
congratulations

1066
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:02,840
But compared with my ability, I was not assigned a good position.

1067
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:05,260
As long as you are willing to give

1068
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,510
No matter how much, I will show my sincerity

1069
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,420
Are you asking me to sell my official position for money?

1070
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:21,580
I feel very grateful for that.

1071
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,070
But as far as I know, your son has passed the imperial examination a long time ago.

1072
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,000
Why now?

1073
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,070
that

1074
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,930
I have already contacted the Fengyang Zhao family.

1075
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,610
That's because my Yue family is distantly related to the Fengyang Zhao family.

1076
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,610
I really can't face you.

1077
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,520
Worried about his smart son's failure in life due to his family's misfortune

1078
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,680
Unable to realize ambitions

1079
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,060
I know the urgency.

1080
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,950
I will help him clear his name and do his bidding.

1081
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:07,880
Obey the order

1082
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:12,270
Thank you thank you thank you

1083
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,350
I heard everything you said.

1084
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,240
I just need friends

1085
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,770
Can deliver life

1086
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,040
Start now

1087
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,280
The lives of everyone in our family belong to adults.

1088
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,390
Pour a drink. We are friends now.

1089
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,520
I don't dare

1090
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,630
Come in, everyone.

1091
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,000
Yes Yes

1092
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,430
So let's drink until our noses are crooked and have some fun today.

1093
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,320
OK

1094
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,090
Really

1095
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,240
very nice

1096
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,880
Really bad

1097
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,530
Have a drink

1098
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,090
very nice

1099
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,140
Master

1100
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,150
So handsome

1101
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:27,780
Who untied my belt today?

1102
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,810
I I

1103
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,830
Ten Years of Prostitution

1104
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,670
This is the first time I've seen someone play so perverted

1105
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,650
It's really bleak

1106
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,610
We have to drink in a place like this.

1107
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,280
Now is not the time to talk about this

1108
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,230
The most likely place to be a secret warehouse

1109
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,380
There is nothing

1110
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,830
Then there's one last place left.

1111
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,970
The uncle's home

1112
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,660
But he also said that he would let the king's uncle be the general of Jinyi

1113
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,990
It's harder to sneak in.

1114
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,530
Seizing the forbidden camp is the lifeline of His Highness.

1115
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,070
Guards disguised as Jinyiwei

1116
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,200
It's only a matter of time before you're found out

1117
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:38,370
What? Isn't that a critical situation?

1118
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,500
If the guards are discovered and disbanded

1119
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,400
Chasing the corrupt every night

1120
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,610
And found illegal books to raid the warehouse

1121
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,710
This is something that Yongping and I have to do.

1122
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,310
On duty during the day and an assassin at night

1123
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,620
There are too many things

1124
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,750
Damn

1125
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,470
To order me like this

1126
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,440
Did you just call me from Jianghua?

1127
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,620
On the way to Hanyang

1128
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,390
The enthusiastic young people have lofty ideals

1129
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,480
Look at your friends, you will succeed.

1130
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,920
Because the words "Save the corrupt North Korea"

1131
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,200
It's you who must follow

1132
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,310
I didn't say that.

1133
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,800
Always said Hanyang so I asked

1134
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,830
You said so

1135
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,890
What to do in Hanyang?

1136
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,940
Go give corrupt North Korea a shot

1137
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:51,670
yes

1138
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,870
I don't know if it's so handsome.

1139
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,090
It makes me do so much work.

1140
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:01,340
This stupid past me

1141
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,330
Is there a big difference between then and now?

1142
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,300
What did you say

1143
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,140
Did they discover our movements?

1144
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,780
Want to master the forbidden camp?

1145
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:19,210
No, if you find out.

1146
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,100
We should send someone to eavesdrop here, too.

1147
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,060
yes

1148
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,490
Too boring

1149
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,410
Where is the restroom?

1150
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,370
Here

1151
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:29,690
You envy me the one I once had.

1152
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,140
It's not mine anymore.

1153
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:41,520
Goodbye my sword Goodbye my dragon ball

1154
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,500
You can't pee standing up.

1155
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:52,150
This dirty world where only those who have it can pee standing up

1156
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,670
I was so sad that I stopped peeing.

1157
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,810
My tears stopped

1158
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:18,180
I don't have a sword or a dragon ball.

1159
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,180
It's better to kill me.

1160
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,570
Why are you so cruel?

1161
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,610
Has the fake one made with pig blood also been discovered?

1162
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,340
Let the uncle be the general of Jinyi

1163
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:53,580
No proof of our actions was found

1164
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:59,040
If I knew, I would have killed my brother and Hong Biejian long ago.

1165
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,620
So why suddenly

1166
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,910
The only changes were the Queen and Concubine Yi entering the palace

1167
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,880
Is this news from the Queen?

1168
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:16,680
Stabbed her father in the neck just after the national wedding

1169
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,230
Scary woman

1170
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,630
It's already like this

1171
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,570
Stop looking for something beforehand

1172
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,440
We are preparing for a struggle for rights and status

1173
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,690
The only way we can punish those in power is

1174
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:35,040
Prove their corruption with clear documents

1175
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:41,050
We can't delay in getting the core double account book

1176
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,160
What to do then

1177
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:46,240
Let's give him the position of Jinyi General.

1178
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,110
but

1179
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:48,960
Throw food to him

1180
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:52,300
They will be attracted by the food and lose sight of their surroundings

1181
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,250
If you are attracted by the general

1182
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,750
It will help to find double accounts.

1183
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,800
The position of the general

1184
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,480
When he thought he got it

1185
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,760
Just grab it.

1186
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,490
It is difficult to keep your position from being taken away, and even more difficult to get it back.

1187
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,790
The Jinyi general is the position of the samurai

1188
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,250
Even if I take office, I'm not healthy.

1189
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,160
Can't stand in that position

1190
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:19,740
Let's create a small accident on the first day in office

1191
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,360
Kim Moon-geun is more sharp-eyed than expected

1192
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:26,010
If I knew about the existence of the Guardian Samurai

1193
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,590
At that time, we will need to use it to defend the forbidden camp.

1194
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,840
The last method to find the double ledger

1195
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,120
If there is such a good method, use it now.

1196
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,290
What is that last method?

1197
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:42,750
Assassination

1198
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,480
Anyway, I know it will come to that point.

1199
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,520
What is this dark room?

1200
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,950
It's time to ring the damn bell

1201
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,770
Isn't that the queen?

1202
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,170
Is this guy stalking us in men's clothing?

1203
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,380
We can't let him go back like that.

1204
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,560
But I don't know where he heard it.

1205
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,220
You must not be alone

1206
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,940
So we need to catch up with him quickly and shut his mouth.

1207
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:05,480
Your Highness

1208
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,910
Now is not the time to hesitate over personal matters

1209
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,960
I do it myself

1210
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:04,780
10 times

1211
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,560
Where are you?

1212
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,130
Damn, if I get caught, it's over.

1213
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:35,850
(Preview of the next episode)

1214
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,530
My lady, you can't trust anyone now.

1215
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,530
The closer the person, the scarier the person

1216
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,550
The Queen knows who the murderer is

1217
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,680
The murderer is

1218
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,320
If the queen heard all

1219
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,960
It should be bloody now.

1220
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,080
Who are you

1221
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,610
How dare this woman enter the imperial kitchen?

1222
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,920
At least I was the boss here during my time.

1223
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:15,170
Is this how you catch it?
