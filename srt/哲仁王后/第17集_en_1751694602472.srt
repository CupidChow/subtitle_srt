(This drama is purely fictional. The characters, groups, events, etc.
None of this has anything to do with history.)

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,230
Congratulations to His Royal Highness

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,110
Thank you for your hard work, Central Palace

4
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,630
Congratulations to the Queen

5
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,310
I'm going to be a father

6
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,350
I...

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,600
She's pregnant

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,680
Stop it for me

9
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,720
Ouch

10
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,350
Get out, get out

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
Your Highness Your Highness...

12
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,700
Why is the Central Palace so angry?

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,420
Rather than anger

14
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,350
It's more like an expression of joy.

15
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,380
right

16
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,510
Um

17
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,800
What is post-pregnancy syndrome?

18
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,580
This is no longer a crisis of self-awareness.

19
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,170
The destruction of self-consciousness

20
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,630
Eternal destruction

21
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,977
My life is really going to end like this

22
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,597
I've said

23
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,407
I am a non-marriageist

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,107
Even if I accidentally got married

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,910
I will definitely not have children.

26
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,950
Now this life

27
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,850
I may not be able to live well alone.

28
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,150
How can I have children?

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,080
This is not the same as in the smoke of war

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,470
Is it the same as taking off the bulletproof vest?

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,700
More than that

32
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,840
Pregnancy and childbirth can shorten your life

33
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,450
As you said, I'm going to sacrifice my life.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Go give birth to a child

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,510
Why should I give up my baby's life?

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,240
Give it to the child who doesn't even know what he looks like

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,760
This damn nature

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,060
Natural Reason

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,870
Better feed the dog.

40
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,520
How can I get pregnant?

41
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,680
(- Episode 17
- Pregnancy is beautiful)

42
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,600
Just a moment please

43
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,110
Niangniang

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,610
(Episode 17)

45
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,070
You actually deceived me

46
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,900
Do you think I will never be able to recognize the red moon?

47
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,960
I just want you to see the truth.

48
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,020
Recognize the true face that you don't even know

49
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,070
The Queen and Ansong Jinshi went their separate ways

50
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,050
But Ansong Jinshi decided to join forces with us.

51
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,400
This can make Yipin you

52
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,680
A great opportunity to take the first seat in the middle hall

53
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,490
Please

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,610
Stop trying to control me.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,820
Birds that have long been accustomed to captivity

56
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,850
How many days can you survive out of the birdcage?

57
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,970
His Majesty the Lord

58
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,220
There is a message that is being sent to the whole nation.

59
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,330
What news

60
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,060
Empress of the Middle Temple

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,720
Pregnant

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,570
That's not

63
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,480
The drumbeat that announces happy events?

64
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,060
Empty warehouse

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,300
There is no way to fill the void

66
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,250
A heart that cannot be filled with delicacies from land and sea

67
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,180
What to fill it with?

68
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,220
I cut off all ties with my family.

69
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,590
I'm alone

70
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,780
grown ups

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,350
grown ups

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,760
grown ups

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,310
What's wrong

74
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,910
An urgent message came from the palace

75
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,240
Murphy

76
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,050
What happened to the lady again?

77
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,400
My Lady

78
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,650
Pregnant

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Why is that?

80
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,560
Your Highness, why

81
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,650
You should think about how to appease the Queen Mother.

82
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,240
Good idea

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,830
Do you have any tricks to appease a woman's heart?

84
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,360
I asked you in vain.

85
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,860
Who should I ask about this?

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,010
So I

87
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,760
I invited someone who can help you

88
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,540
Experts who can solve your problems are here

89
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,840
Hearing about his life

90
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,340
After dinner, I kept thinking about those questions.

91
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,070
What are you doing?

92
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,090
She will definitely be angry.

93
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,800
At that time, you should say

94
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,490
I am watering the flowers

95
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,520
I guess I won't be able to get out alive.

96
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,170
She should still have a temper.

97
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,030
If so

98
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,540
I have a very good idea too.

99
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
What can I do?

100
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,650
Make such a funny expression

101
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,580
I'm beginning to hate myself for having the same idea as him.

102
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,450
I am terrified

103
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,810
But it really helped me

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,220
How come?

105
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,970
How stupid it is to ask for help

106
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,740
He told me

107
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,810
I am the one who knows her best.

108
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,340
Why are you crying?

109
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,050
I'm the one who wants to cry.

110
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,750
I'm so happy

111
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,840
My lady, please cry as much as you want today.

112
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,150
Okay, cry.

113
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,010
Cry as much as you want for me.

114
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,350
For the life path I never chose

115
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,960
Niangniang

116
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,810
You don't have time to cry tears of joy now

117
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,080
So what am I going to do now?

118
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,650
You have to go and talk to the elders of the inner chamber ladies in person.

119
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,880
Announce the good news of pregnancy

120
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,890
Accepting everyone's congratulations

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,180
No, I have severed ties with my family.

122
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,270
Regardless of whether the relationship is severed or not

123
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,820
You don't follow the rules

124
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,370
I will definitely be caught by others in the future.

125
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,720
This makes me hate being pregnant even more

126
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,880
The Queen Mother has arrived

127
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,230
The Queen Consort has arrived

128
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,700
I was actually taken advantage of.

129
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,550
What should I do?

130
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,710
Two of you are here

131
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,760
I should have visited you two first to tell you the good news.

132
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,870
But as you two have seen

133
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,270
I really can't move.

134
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,020
What is this symptom called?

135
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,220
It's morning sickness and severe dizziness caused by pregnancy

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,990
right

137
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,380
Exactly

138
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,540
So I came here in person

139
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,740
Please two

140
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,390
Take a seat

141
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,630
No

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,610
Your body is so heavy, so you better be at ease

143
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,660
Okay

144
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,670
I was so happy when I heard the news

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,490
They all picked up the spells they had given up.

146
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,380
I hope our precious grandson can be born safely.

147
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,600
But why does this look like a curse?

148
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
I am atheist

149
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,100
Don't believe these things

150
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,530
You will know after your child is born.

151
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,380
I want to pursue a faith that I don't have.

152
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,670
Even to the stone at my feet

153
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,480
I also want to pray urgently

154
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,600
Even if it is the only nave that I can rule

155
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,090
It's time to start being afraid of everything in the world.

156
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,950
Losing a child is the mother's fault

157
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,480
I have ordered the imperial physician to prepare medicine to prevent miscarriage.

158
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,890
You must remember to eat on time in the future

159
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,270
Once something goes wrong with the prince

160
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,750
You can't get away from it.

161
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,880
I hope you won't act rashly in the future.

162
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,870
For the prince in the belly

163
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,240
Please proceed with caution.

164
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,220
They came together to threaten me

165
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,010
It makes me want to vomit.

166
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,440
Holy Grace

167
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,680
Your Excellency, Lord Yongping, requests an audience

168
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
Come in

169
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,940
You came here because you were worried about me, right?

170
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,090
I'm fine

171
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,130
Although I cannot go to congratulate His Highness and His Majesty the Queen

172
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,070
I still have my own way to go

173
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,260
I entered the palace to help His Highness.

174
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,510
I thought I could help him.

175
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,070
Only mental dependence

176
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,370
As a result, I saw the Queen Mother and found that it was not the case.

177
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,490
This can make Yipin you

178
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,730
A great opportunity to take the first seat in the middle hall

179
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,080
Concubine

180
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,360
What's the matter that brings you here in person?

181
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,900
Yipin, how could you...

182
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,720
I heard you teamed up with Ansong Jinshi.

183
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,220
That means the door of the house.

184
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,870
Please don't sell out your family in a nameless struggle

185
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,440
Do you still want to protect the reputation of integrity?

186
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,130
Then you better make the right choice.

187
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
Otherwise

188
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,750
I will call a group led by my father.

189
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,530
The power of clan members who truly worry about the future of North Korea

190
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,850
Are these all sent by my father?

191
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,050
Yes

192
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,240
They are all gifts for your unborn child.

193
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,160
There's more

194
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,160
The corridors are full.

195
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,990
After seeing this, I became even more upset.

196
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,100
It's late at night and the little light is on

197
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,380
You don't need those candles.

198
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,550
My life from now on

199
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,860
Only darkness remains

200
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,240
This time, I am only dealing with those petty officials in front of the government office.

201
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,450
Nor did he cut off the leader's head.

202
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,260
The reason why the leader was not moved was because

203
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,280
I guess I'm afraid of being considered a traitor.

204
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,650
That's all their courage is.

205
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
We have no excuse to deploy large numbers of troops.

206
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,500
What a headache

207
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,540
The secret code of the Eastern Bandits discovered last time

208
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,090
Was it found in the palace?

209
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,170
The Eastern Bandits have invaded the palace.

210
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,010
This matter is no small matter

211
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,070
Should we investigate quickly?

212
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,000
If we leave the Eastern Bandits in the palace alone

213
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,700
What should I do if it grows wildly like bamboo shoots in spring?

214
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,850
Just do your part.

215
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,500
Niangniang

216
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,340
Starting today

217
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,970
It's time to officially start prenatal education

218
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,130
(New Notes on Prenatal Education)
It's time to officially start prenatal education

219
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,690
(New Notes on Prenatal Education)

220
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,760
You can't lie sideways like that.

221
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,790
You can't rest your head on your arms.

222
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,230
You can't lie down with your neck tilted up.

223
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,270
Damn

224
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,810
Can't laugh, scared, crying

225
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,800
Crying and talking a lot

226
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,790
To absolutely prohibit

227
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,770
Unusual food tastes

228
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,170
My body is no longer my own.

229
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,700
Even though it's not my own body

230
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,250
But now I've adapted to it

231
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,730
Why do I have to start all over again when I get pregnant?

232
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,740
Especially Choi Sang-Gong

233
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,640
Didn't you say you'd never say no again?

234
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,230
This is all for the little prince in your belly.

235
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,030
Only if I live can my child live.

236
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,270
Am I a baby-making machine?

237
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,520
Is it a human incubator?

238
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,780
besides

239
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,010
Is it only the mother who does prenatal education? What about the father?

240
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,710
You should ask Zhezong to do some prenatal education as well.

241
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,490
Just right

242
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,830
New Notes on Prenatal Education Chapter 1 Section 3

243
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,230
The responsibility for prenatal education lies with the father

244
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,400
Wait for His Highness to retire tonight

245
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,960
You two should do prenatal education together

246
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,590
Start prenatal education as soon as you wake up

247
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,240
Do I still need to do prenatal education when I am about to go to bed?

248
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,320
Is my life over so soon?

249
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,640
no

250
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,190
no

251
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,780
Take it out

252
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,940
Hong Yan

253
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,570
After that incident, here

254
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,440
The Queen and Kim Byung-in never had any contact again

255
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Then I was abandoned and heard that she was pregnant.

256
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,730
From now on, he will have no one to rely on.

257
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,680
So pitiful

258
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,730
Have you got a meal yet

259
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,240
Go back

260
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,970
Go home and sleep

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
Your face has become much thinner

262
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,080
Stress is the root of all diseases

263
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,900
This is not good for prenatal education.

264
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,980
Go and help me take a look

265
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,790
Just one spoon

266
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,890
My pear blossom wine

267
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,380
Waiting for experienced people

268
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,580
My pear blossom wine

269
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,890
Throw it all away because it's all rotten

270
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,610
You seem very happy.

271
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm the same as usual, ma'am.

272
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,250
Didn't you say a long time ago

273
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
Have you lost your smile?

274
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,190
I've got my smile back

275
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,710
I lost the pear wine

276
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,540
Choi Sang-Gong found her smile again

277
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,440
How could there be such a coincidence?

278
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,070
To be honest, Choi Sang-Gong

279
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,880
Are you secretly happy?

280
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,720
I think I suffered a lot before.

281
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,100
You're taking revenge on me now, right?

282
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,800
You can't shake, my lady.

283
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,810
Spit it out

284
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,780
Spit out my pear blossom wine

285
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,660
No, my lady.

286
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,520
Please speak well, my lady.

287
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,400
What the hell is going on?

288
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,790
My pear blossom wine

289
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,680
I have finished all my pear blossom wine.

290
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,880
My pear blossom wine

291
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,330
Niangniang

292
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,180
Spit out all my pear blossom wine

293
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,950
Niangniang

294
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,180
My pear blossom wine

295
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,180
Why are you crying?

296
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,130
oops

297
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,490
Hey

298
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,130
I'm waiting for you

299
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,420
So handsome, like a prince on a white horse

300
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,000
I can't do anything

301
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,600
You are still happy riding a horse, right?

302
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,670
Looks like I'm angry today too.

303
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,480
It's a blessing

304
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
Let's ride together

305
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,990
No, Your Highness.

306
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,070
There is a little prince in my belly.

307
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,420
How can you ride a horse? Your Highness

308
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,870
Niangniang

309
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,020
Dangerous

310
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,230
No, my lady.

311
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,350
Where is this

312
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,160
I have always wanted to give it to the middle temple.

313
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,510
What you like most

314
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,510
There is nothing in the palace, only outside the palace

315
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,420
Is that you?

316
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,290
It's freedom

317
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,430
Don't like it?

318
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,080
Just say it out loud and relax.

319
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,780
Why is it so exaggerated?

320
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,940
Come to the royal palace to relax. If you don't like it

321
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,400
Let's go back.

322
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,420
Is the annex palace the same as the villa?

323
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,400
It's pretty good, like a rich second generation out for fun

324
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,010
Now that you're here, let's go in and take a look.

325
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,380
Well, I know you'll like it.

326
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,420
Over here, over here

327
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,960
Wow, it's still worth doing.

328
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,720
Such a magnificent villa has a courtyard

329
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,540
I thought about it all night

330
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,500
Why are you so angry?

331
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,310
Generally speaking, for women in the palace

332
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,690
Pregnancy is a blessing

333
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,420
Why for the Middle Temple?

334
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,130
Pregnancy is a very annoying thing

335
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,550
Then what

336
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,480
Do you know why?

337
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,680
No

338
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,430
I don't know after thinking about it.

339
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,120
so

340
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,010
I can't understand it, but I want to accept it

341
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,640
It is a blessing for others.

342
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,290
This may not be the case for the nave.

343
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,580
The middle temple is such a person

344
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,500
The Middle Temple Dictionary was not wasted.

345
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,630
What are you doing? It's so embarrassing.

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,740
nave

347
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,870
Is this woo woo?

348
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,670
Woohoo

349
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,620
I wrote the Middle Temple Dictionary. There is one thing I am curious about.

350
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,420
What does All in mean?

351
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,740
Did I say that?

352
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,510
You shouted so loudly in the neighborhood casino

353
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
That?

354
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,710
All in means putting the easily broken eggs

355
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,280
Put all in one basket

356
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,000
Very stupid behavior

357
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,660
egg

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,600
I did

359
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,510
Such a stupid thing

360
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,430
Alas, at this critical moment when I should be working hard

361
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,910
I was tripped by the stone of pregnancy.

362
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,340
Don't worry about the nave

363
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,670
I will definitely

364
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,720
Remove the corrupt part of North Korea

365
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,200
For our children who will inherit this country

366
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,820
yes

367
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,610
If this child becomes king and inherits this country

368
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,260
I can become

369
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,440
The one in power who does everything?

370
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,750
(The world of pure element)

371
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,300
(Zhao Rong's World)

372
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,790
Why didn't I think of this?

373
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,850
child

374
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,530
You mean

375
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,320
Take a look

376
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,180
This world is all

377
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,540
your

378
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,780
Go back

379
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,460
Now begins the real prenatal education

380
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,150
Real prenatal education

381
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,040
We need to find a way to teach him how to win.

382
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,810
This child will always live in

383
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,850
The palace is like a battlefield

384
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,850
Let's go and start it up.

385
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,840
I just arrived so soon

386
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,830
Wrote 100 volumes of the Middle Temple Dictionary

387
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,700
Can I understand the man of the middle temple?

388
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,500
Let's go together. Let's go together.

389
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,550
Come here quickly

390
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,830
(Prenatal Education Diary)

391
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,210
child

392
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,260
If you want to survive in the palace

393
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,230
We must not slack off in cultivating our own people

394
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,010
Your Highness is amazing

395
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,190
He is indeed the most powerful warrior in Korea.

396
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,290
child

397
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,820
The more enemies there are, the more you should keep them by your side.

398
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,670
One thousand soldiers

399
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,510
Train so many soldiers

400
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,690
Do you want to attack Xuanzheng Hall?

401
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,330
Are you scared?

402
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,550
Oh

403
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,930
The military officer trained a thousand soldiers because he was afraid of me.

404
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,260
The number will be halved and the rest will be transferred to the Imperial Guard Battalion.

405
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,930
child

406
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,940
Be sure to prepare another purse

407
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,580
This is a newly minted copper coin.

408
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,420
How much?

409
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,930
One million taels

410
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,690
Wow, this is the king's political funding.

411
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,460
Money can buy power

412
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,320
This is the last item, kid.

413
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,210
It is also the most important thing

414
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,800
You must get rid of all the people who are not yours.

415
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,590
Life is a battle and this world is a jungle

416
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,070
If you don't eat others, you will be eaten by others.

417
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,930
A bloody war

418
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,560
It's a killing party.

419
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,610
Of course we must work for peace

420
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,150
But when there is no hope

421
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,780
Even if it takes any means, I must win the child

422
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,920
Madam, I'm so lucky that you can cheer up.

423
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,400
Still in the belly

424
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,950
Is there so much you want to say?

425
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,850
Only when in my belly will you listen

426
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,190
They won't be so obedient when they are born.

427
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,910
It's time for bed

428
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,960
Where is the time to sleep now?

429
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,790
I have a lot of things to do.

430
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,420
Life is a treadmill

431
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,110
Just stop

432
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,790
will be eliminated

433
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,120
Even pregnancy can't stop me

434
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,390
Hey it will stop me

435
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,320
My heart is a motorcycle boat

436
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,000
The body is a wooden boat

437
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,940
haven't seen you for a long time

438
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,830
It's really hard

439
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,650
No

440
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,120
You have finished writing the military book.

441
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,200
Although those who have never held a weapon

442
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,660
Being a soldier is not easy

443
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,570
Should be helpful

444
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,410
Be careful

445
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,360
Other personnel

446
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,100
It just doesn't grow.

447
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,780
mean

448
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,200
There are many people suffering.

449
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,460
recently

450
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,010
The Fall of the Yangban and the Drug Dealers

451
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,390
There are all kinds of identities gathered together

452
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,270
Maybe it's just like what the middle temple said

453
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,190
Is abolishing the system of gentility the answer?

454
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,590
Too radical ideas

455
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,040
It is also necessary to be vigilant

456
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,100
Of course it was a long time later.

457
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,250
Even if I am helpless

458
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,070
maybe

459
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,740
The widow's children can do it

460
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,080
Niangniang

461
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,880
The Lord's Palace...

462
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,460
Don't wake her up.

463
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,870
Like a child

464
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,670
(Children must prepare a purse to buy power with money)

465
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,320
Party?

466
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,830
group

467
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,840
Yes, that's the problem, party.

468
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,370
The Central Palace is fine and you haven't gotten into any trouble.

469
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,490
Sure enough, the spell I wrote is effective.

470
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,770
Holy Grace

471
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,710
so

472
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,680
The rumor I mentioned has spread well, right?

473
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,690
Really diligent early in the morning

474
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,120
Let's clean up our eyes first before we chat.

475
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,270
You should listen to it too.

476
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,480
Maybe he'll wake up soon.

477
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,220
I heard that the Queen Mother...

478
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,020
Heard

479
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,040
What

480
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,250
Did His Majesty and His Majesty have a fake marriage consummation?

481
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,430
His Highness the Lord and the Empress of the Middle Palace

482
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,730
It's a fake consummation

483
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,760
Actually, there is no consummation of the marriage.

484
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,700
We just slept together all night.

485
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,660
no

486
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,780
So whose child is this?

487
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,480
If it's not His Majesty's words, whose are they?

488
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,490
No way

489
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,870
I heard that it's not His Highness's, it's fake.

490
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,910
The middle temple has also heard about it.

491
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,980
Rumors spread in the palace

492
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,240
Rumors are always like this after the fact

493
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,320
When exactly are you talking about?

494
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,270
In the palace

495
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,530
Donâ€™t underestimate rumors

496
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,020
Maybe you'll see that as a problem.

497
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,030
Advancing the issue of dethronement

498
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,920
Dethroned at every turn

499
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,960
I really do because it's so dirty and mean

500
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,780
I will never be driven away

501
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,390
Hello Hong Yan

502
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,770
What happened to the hairpin?

503
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,940
What's this

504
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,690
This is a ridiculous posture.

505
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,440
We need to stop the rumors.

506
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,960
What...

507
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,580
In this case

508
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,970
Can the rumors stop at this level?

509
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,550
To this extent

510
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,040
Too much

511
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,700
Although not as good as the few

512
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,720
not enough

513
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,380
Let's inject some soul

514
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,050
If I inject a little more soul, I will draw the curtain.

515
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,660
Is that what you want?

516
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,600
Who said you wanted it?

517
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,670
It's just for external needs.

518
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,370
So because it is necessary for external

519
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm going to the Great Hall tonight.

520
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,910
Because there is really no way to abolish the throne

521
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,690
So

522
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,760
See you later

523
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,510
Are you gone?

524
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,850
I don't know how slow it will go or how long it will take

525
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,330
There's nothing we can do.

526
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,110
Niangniang

527
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,260
The Empress Yipin is here

528
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,410
Was it done by the Queen Consort?

529
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,970
What do you mean?

530
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,070
rumor

531
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,190
All thanks to you

532
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,510
I can't remember when I remembered what you said to me

533
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,610
The palace told you that it was a fake marriage consummation.

534
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,680
Therefore, the pregnancy of the nave would become an unwelcome pregnancy

535
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,080
The words that come out of your mouth

536
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,150
Became an arrow and shot towards the nave

537
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,890
Please stop here.

538
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,170
I can't do anything now

539
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,020
Once the rumor reaches people's hands

540
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,000
It can't be recovered

541
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,590
The same to you

542
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,860
There's no way to get away now.

543
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,430
Just one day in this palace

544
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,430
You can't be free

545
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,250
Your existence alone is of use to our family.

546
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,290
Since you are being used, please stand in front

547
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,080
It's terrible

548
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,350
Right?

549
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,630
but

550
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,150
After all, you are not alone, don't worry

551
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,320
I am so disappointed to become so similar to the Queen Mother.

552
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,250
Feeling terrible

553
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,090
Do you know why the family follows the Queen Dowager?

554
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,420
Exactly

555
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,300
Because you are a victim of grief after losing a child

556
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,570
but

557
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,140
If a mother kills her son in order to save her own life

558
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,410
Plus

559
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,230
Bewildered by superstitions

560
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,790
The foolishness of relying on the tongue of the bodhisattva for the survival of the family

561
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,480
Do you still think you are the head of the family?

562
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,140
What I Saw and Heard in the Palace During This Period

563
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,110
I will record everything in detail so that everyone in North Korea will know

564
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,200
That thing

565
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,430
What is the power

566
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,750
What power is there?

567
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,650
You will know

568
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,340
You told me

569
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,670
I don't want to regret it again

570
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,110
Things to regret

571
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,870
It's not that I couldn't prevent the death of the previous king.

572
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,310
It trampled on the previous king's dream.

573
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,290
A mother's hand breaks the wings of her children

574
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,310
Please regret this.

575
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,920
What the former king wanted to get rid of was

576
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,580
Mother's Shelter

577
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,570
I know nothing.

578
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,090
How dare you speak so wildly

579
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,940
This is a fact known to everyone

580
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,130
In fact, Queen Consort, you also know this, right?

581
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,900
I won't let you trample on your highness's dreams.

582
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,990
That woman...

583
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,770
Go to the Dazao Temple

584
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,920
yes

585
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,450
So what

586
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,920
Isn't it said that rumors and dreams are the opposite?

587
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,140
Rumors too?

588
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,940
The matter of consummating marriage with His Highness

589
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,850
It was originally a private matter and there was no need to publicize it.

590
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,030
If everyone knew, they would be shocked.

591
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,140
last night

592
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,150
Such a hot secret cannot be told

593
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,780
So depressing

594
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,950
Your Highness is different from what he looks like.

595
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,580
Is he a king of energy who can go down in history?

596
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,540
Is it because of me?

597
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,670
So that's what was recorded?

598
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,830
Who spread the rumors?

599
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,420
The only thing I can do is to

600
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,860
It's okay. It's okay.

601
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,710
What's wrong? What are you investigating?

602
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,750
Are you confident?

603
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,560
Fight them together with His Highness

604
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,310
Do you really have the confidence to win?

605
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,420
This is my fight too

606
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,890
I have reasons to win.

607
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,410
Then practice bow and arrow.

608
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,430
Such strength is not only of no help

609
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,660
Instead it will become a burden

610
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,700
Then let our Yipin teach me.

611
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:23,120
I don't have time

612
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,500
Your Highness is Concubine Yi

613
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,920
Let her in

614
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,960
I have something to ask of you, Your Highness.

615
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,380
Tell me

616
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,070
You have to promise me

617
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,340
What is the request?

618
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,680
Please let me out of the palace

619
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,510
What does that mean?

620
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,170
I can't find myself in this palace

621
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,090
Please depose me

622
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,820
Let me live under my own name

623
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,840
Can't

624
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,260
Don't you know what the life of an abandoned concubine is like?

625
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,420
I don't care about the world's eyes

626
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,430
no

627
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,410
I won't be bound by those anymore.

628
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,050
This is my last request, please agree to it

629
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,930
I don't agree. I can't agree.

630
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,180
Although Your Highness and I cherish each other

631
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,600
But it's no longer a feeling of longing.

632
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,990
Now I am just a concubine

633
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,550
I was just locked up in another palace.

634
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,680
Your Highness and the ministers are all here.

635
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,810
I called all the ministers here.

636
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,540
It's to convey important news.

637
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:07,750
At this moment, I will be the first-class Zhao Huazhen

638
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,400
Dethroned Concubine Yi

639
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,280
Is this meant to be blocked?

640
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,630
Concubine Yi is no longer ours

641
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,940
Your Highness, please take care of yourself.

642
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,690
I will pray for your future.

643
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,030
Charity

644
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,590
Don't call me that anymore.

645
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,750
You can't do this, Your Highness. You can't do this.

646
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,960
I requested it.

647
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:22,960
Why

648
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,940
This is good for everyone.

649
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,350
As long as I'm in the palace, I won't care about my own will.

650
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,830
Blocking His Highness's Way

651
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,600
I will stop it

652
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,760
You can still save it. Tell His Highness right away.

653
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,950
I can't trust myself anymore

654
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,390
Stay here

655
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,990
I will completely lose myself

656
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,470
I know Yongping's heart

657
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,760
But I kept pretending not to know

658
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,510
Charity

659
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,280
I used that heart

660
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:09,750
I kept looking at His Highness but he didn't look at me

661
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,320
I filled that void with Yongping Jun

662
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,390
I

663
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,660
I am willing to be used

664
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,390
This is all I can give you.

665
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:34,340
Thank you and I'm sorry

666
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,370
Yongping-kun should not continue

667
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,160
It's not because of my wrong love affair.

668
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,710
That's what I meant that day.

669
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,030
A very handsome woman.

670
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,410
Is Cheoljong okay? It's impossible that he's okay.

671
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,070
Have a fight with me

672
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,750
Not in the mood

673
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:47,910
Childhood

674
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,370
Games often played in Jianghua

675
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,500
The person who steps on the opponent's shadow first wins.

676
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,060
If you really don't want to do it, you can admit defeat.

677
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,480
Remember?

678
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,380
I always won when I was a kid.

679
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,950
I just remember that I always won.

680
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,300
The ranking should have been determined long ago

681
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,520
No, it's not decided.

682
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,860
But you couldn't do it

683
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,920
Yipin was still worried about His Highness until the end.

684
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,310
Your Highness does not know the value of that heart

685
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,600
Not that I don't know

686
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,790
So it's painful

687
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,790
You will become more painful

688
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,810
That is

689
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,760
The minimum respect for the emperor

690
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:38,360
How lonely and painful I must be

691
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,280
How much more is needed

692
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,700
Our Sect

693
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,330
Are you drinking somewhere?

694
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,560
If I wasn't pregnant

695
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,040
I drank with him.

696
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,630
But pregnancy is not about giving birth to a newborn

697
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,470
Am I a newborn?

698
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,760
Why am I always so sleepy?

699
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,440
I'm going to Tongming Palace

700
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,170
Be careful

701
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,200
How dangerous are rumors?

702
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,880
If we knew that the rumor originated from the Queen Dowager,

703
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,980
Before the rumor reached the Queen Mother's ears

704
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,530
I want to convey it myself

705
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,920
but

706
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,650
Don't worry about An Sang Gong

707
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,270
I will tell you the rumors I spread

708
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,990
Deliver it to her personally

709
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,050
I guess she didn't even think about it.

710
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,230
I didn't even summon you, yet you come here like this?

711
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,670
It seems like there is something you want to ask for.

712
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,870
Because of the rumors that were too shocking

713
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,360
I'm worried you'll be frightened.

714
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,800
That's why I came here in such a hurry

715
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,340
Rumor?

716
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,750
How can you even do such an outrageous thing?

717
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,510
They are busy investigating.

718
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,560
After you heard

719
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,470
It's definitely not that easy to say

720
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,780
I'm really curious.

721
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,650
What exactly is the rumor?

722
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,820
It will make you run so excitedly

723
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,390
It's such a pity, how could I miss it?

724
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,200
The expression you make after hearing the rumor

725
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,290
Rumors worth noting

726
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,140
It will make it difficult for you to see the expression you want to see

727
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,810
The child that the Queen is carrying is not a prince.

728
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,780
That's Kim Byung-in's seed.

729
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,200
Why do you attach so much importance to your home?

730
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,020
Now Ansong Jinshi

731
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,840
Became a family that tarnished the royal bloodline

732
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,380
And recorded in history

733
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:19,970
Very interesting

734
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,080
It's become very interesting

735
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,900
Hey, have you heard about that rumor?

736
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,290
I've heard of it a long time ago

737
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,460
rumor

738
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,350
Your Highness and the Empress of the Middle Palace

739
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,710
It is very accurate...

740
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,150
Yes, it is indeed necessary to have a palace meeting

741
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,820
What are you doing?

742
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,220
It's not like that

743
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,960
It is said that the child is not His Highness's child.

744
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,060
This is going to get you beheaded.

745
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,280
The whole palace

746
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,840
They are all laughing at our door

747
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,230
It turns out that there is a relative who is in mourning

748
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:05,750
(Relatives who are in mourning are close relatives who need to wear mourning clothes according to the five mourning clothes system)
It turns out that there is a relative who is in mourning

749
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,950
(Relatives who are in mourning are close relatives who need to wear mourning clothes according to the five mourning clothes system)

750
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,760
The children of the middle palace and the military judge
(Relatives who are in mourning are close relatives who need to wear mourning clothes according to the five mourning clothes system)

751
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,570
The children of the middle palace and the military judge

752
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,610
I had high hopes for Bingpan

753
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,530
But this

754
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,850
After the incident with Concubine Yi, I thought everything was over.

755
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,680
After hearing what the middle temple said

756
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,540
A feeling of victory

757
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,120
Not the prince but someone else's son.

758
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,170
I am a person who regards my family as more important than my life.

759
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,240
So I live for my family.

760
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,570
What do you live for?

761
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,370
I am the same as the Queen Mother

762
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,850
Yeah

763
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,080
In this case

764
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,480
Can you do anything for your home door?

765
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes

766
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:15,490
Then come to me immediately with the head of the man in the middle hall

767
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,860
This is the order of the house.

768
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,890
What is the reason?

769
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,480
The nave will open our door

770
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,720
The reputation gained through centuries of struggle has been shattered.

771
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,850
The King and the Concubine

772
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,650
I don't know why you're so angry though.

773
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,180
Please handle this matter at your discretion.

774
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:34,940
Everyone in the palace was spreading

775
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,750
The Queen and His Highness actually did not sleep together at all

776
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,230
Now, they say that the baby in the middle palace's belly

777
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,880
It's your blood

778
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,390
that

779
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,100
That's not true.

780
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,920
What everyone believes

781
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,400
That's the truth

782
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,370
People coming and going

783
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,220
Rumors spread far and wide

784
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,260
The Queen was pregnant by adultery

785
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,690
Deceiving the baby in the belly that he is a prince

786
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,040
He is a sinner who has tainted the royal bloodline.

787
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,740
It's because of me that the rumors spread

788
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,470
I'll be punished

789
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,350
If a man is hurt by rumors

790
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,680
Then the woman will die because of the rumor.

791
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,150
To protect the family's reputation

792
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,490
What is needed is the head of the nave

793
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,310
If you can execute the Nave yourself

794
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,560
I will not ask about your sins

795
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,910
I can't do that

796
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,910
Please let me take the punishment for her.

797
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,360
Didn't you say you live for your family?

798
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:27,530
You live for the Central Palace.

799
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,070
If that's the case, I can only instruct others to do it.

800
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:31,980
Someone come

801
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:37,710
I will help you regain power behind the scenes right away.

802
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,490
You came into contact with something dangerous.

803
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,620
On the booklet with the name of the Empress of the Middle Temple written

804
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,160
The secret code of the Eastern Bandits written in the font of His Highness

805
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,140
Dangerous Thoughts

806
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,350
Affected His Highness and the Middle Temple

807
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,890
They want to overthrow this country.

808
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,780
This sense of crisis

809
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,320
What would happen if the scholars felt it?

810
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,550
Even if I kill half of the people

811
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,190
They will also want to preserve the current North Korea.

812
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,560
Will start killing the Dong bandit gangs on a large scale

813
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,060
If so

814
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,650
Why not do that right away?

815
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,580
But come to me

816
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,220
Because the Queen will also be hurt

817
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,430
But Ansong Jinshi

818
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,540
The Queen Mother became the target

819
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,280
The rumor that the queen and I had an affair and got pregnant

820
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,860
Want to kill the Queen's reputation

821
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,270
He did that to attack me.

822
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,850
I will stop it.

823
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,290
You can't stop it

824
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,480
Even if we save each other's lives

825
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,890
The Queen Entangled in Scandal

826
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,690
If the house comes out to attack

827
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:37,460
The queen will become worse than death

828
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,890
Not only the queen

829
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,150
The same is true for the prince who was born

830
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,980
To shake your position

831
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,480
The ministers with red eyes

832
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,960
How will he tear and torture the Queen?

833
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,270
Don't you know

834
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,300
Only you can save the Queen

835
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:01,430
What is

836
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,740
How I can save the nave

837
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,460
Come back after suppressing the civil unrest.

838
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,550
You have to get rid of the Dong bandits yourself.

839
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,170
To protect the country

840
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,730
The woman who tore apart the king who went to war

841
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,220
It is against reason.

842
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,160
Rumors can defeat strength

843
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,430
And I have to personally eradicate the Eastern Bandits

844
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,390
Prove you have no connection with them

845
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,530
Secret codes for children's learning

846
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,150
It won't be a threat anymore.

847
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,780
This is what can save the lady

848
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:41,370
The only way to have your child in her belly

849
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,160
No time to hesitate

850
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,390
When the sun rises, the queen will be swallowed by rumors.

851
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:59,830
I will never let you get hurt alone.

852
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,400
I'm not sleeping

853
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,110
Just thinking

854
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,920
Why don't you just lie down and stay like this?

855
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,320
I'm here to comfort you.

856
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,550
But I fell into deep thought

857
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,780
I'm so sleepy

858
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,220
I'll comfort you tomorrow.

859
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,380
It has comforted me

860
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,930
The reason for the increase in civil unrest in the three difficult areas

861
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,210
I left in a hurry.

862
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,620
During my absence

863
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,760
I'll leave the national administration to you.

864
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,720
besides

865
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,900
The Nave and My Children

866
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,720
I'm sure you'll take good care of it.

867
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,950
I've already put aside state affairs and feel quite relaxed.

868
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,190
But there is no other way

869
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,280
Don't worry, go ahead.

870
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,460
My father risked his life to go to the battlefield

871
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,300
Caring for a lonely mother and child

872
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,340
This is as it should be

873
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:47,420
I left believing in what you said.

874
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,080
Take care of your body

875
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,190
It's already dawn.

876
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:24,530
Your Highness

877
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:28,910
I'll do the rest myself.

878
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,740
Your Highness

879
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,890
Your Highness, please go and suppress the civil unrest yourself.

880
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:44,880
Is it true?

881
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,250
It's true

882
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,910
What's going on

883
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,450
Your Highness, you are here to support the people.

884
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:50,850
To eradicate them

885
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,530
Jin Bingren found the secret code of the Eastern Bandits in the Tongmeng Xianxue

886
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,190
If I don't leave now

887
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,370
More people will be hurt

888
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,620
I'm going to follow you too.

889
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,810
The condition is that I go by myself

890
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,490
I am enough as a hostage.

891
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,350
This is a trap

892
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,900
Don't you think that Kim Byung-in

893
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,240
Will the person who teaches first be the middle palace?

894
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,720
You clearly made a promise with me

895
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,690
If it is confirmed that the Nave is the enemy

896
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,340
Will kill her

897
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,040
Your Highness, the people you should kill are not the common people.

898
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,300
But the nave

899
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,580
The Queen is indeed not our enemy.

900
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,210
To be mine,

901
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,600
Betrayed everyone

902
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,480
If I don't leave now

903
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,600
The nave will die

904
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,780
Calm down, everyone.

905
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,360
Now is not the time for a quarrel between us

906
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,340
You said I was going to suffer more, right?

907
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:47,760
That's right

908
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,420
I will leave with all of this.

909
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,270
Your Highness, your life

910
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,360
It will be dangerous

911
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,970
If I were to live

912
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,890
Then everyone will die.

913
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,530
I clearly saw him

914
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,510
Is this a dream?

915
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:40,580
Choi Sang-Gong

916
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,070
Hong Yan

917
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,140
Let's go to the Dazao Temple

918
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,480
It seems that I have lost touch with His Highness.

919
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,590
Good lady

920
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,750
Your Highness is leaving now.

921
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,340
Leaving? Where to go?

922
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,380
It's time to go

923
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,520
Wait a moment

924
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,000
Stop for a moment

925
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,510
Wait a moment

926
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,510
Why

927
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,570
Why

928
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,480
Is this the road?

929
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,020
I feel like this is not a path that humans can take.

930
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,930
Taking a shortcut

931
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:38,940
Stop

932
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,760
It's too late

933
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,950
Do this anyway

934
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,140
Why not speed up?

935
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:55,960
Do you want to dismount yourself or do you want me to help you?

936
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,620
Since there is no way out

937
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,830
Then I can only try my best

938
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,090
Don't worry

939
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,360
I am enough on my own

940
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,520
As long as you disappear

941
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,910
(This drama is purely fictional. The characters, groups, events, etc.
None of this has anything to do with history.)

942
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,140
(Preview of the next episode)

943
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,130
This little one is really edible.

944
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,660
Please tell dad to come back soon.

945
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,790
It seemed to move just now.

946
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:47,490
Her Majesty,

947
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,050
Now the owner of that position is going to change.

948
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,060
What's the use of this?

949
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,180
You are no longer here

950
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,230
Not guilty?

951
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,980
It is also a sin to stand on the weak side

952
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,170
Brother, how far do you plan to go?

953
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,270
Compared to other

954
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,650
To have a healthy and safe birth

955
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,470
You exchanged the life of His Highness for the life of the Highness.

956
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:07,340
I'll come back in person.
