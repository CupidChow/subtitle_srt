1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,460


2
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,130
    
     

3
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,070
   

4
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,040
    

5
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,520
- Your Majesty. 
 - Your Majesty!

6
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,600
  The fact that there is a tomorrow for us, 

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,010
  is such a miracle. 

8
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,710
Your Majesty, it's dangerous. There may be another explosion.

9
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,800
- Your Majesty! 
 - You can't!

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,650
Your Majesty! Are you all right!

11
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,460
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

12
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,760
Protect the king!

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,290
Your Majesty!

14
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,830
Your Highness! You must go, Your Highness!

15
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,210
 - Your Highness. 
 - Let's hurry. 

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,460
- No. I have to save him! 
 - Your Majesty!

17
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,850
No. You can’t go there.

18
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,610
Your Majesty, you can’t get involved in this matter.

19
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,830
What are you talking about? Right now the king is—

20
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,860
Listen to me!

21
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,160
I'll give you more details later.

22
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,430
Right now, you must think about your own safety.

23
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,930
It's dangerous, so take Her Majesty to Daejojeon right now!

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,230
Your Majesty, you can’t go there!

25
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,570
Let go of me!

26
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,160
- Your Majesty, please. 
 - Let go of me!

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,810
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!!

28
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,710
 Your Majesty! 

29
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,800
  However, only when tomorrow doesn't come for us, 

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,810
 do we realize it is a miracle. 

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,880
  Always not realizing how precious something is until after you lose it, 

32
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,270
  is how foolish we are. 

33
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,820
   

34
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,600
    

35
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,090
Someone dared attempt an assassination of the king.

36
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,620
If anyone is the least bit suspicious, we shall interrogate them.

37
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,760
Whoever did this,

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,570
we must definitely find.

39
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,620
Is this what you prepared?

40
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,490
How will you bear the consequences of the storm?

41
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,730
Please calm down.

42
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,020
Does it look like I can calm down!

43
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,790
The king's life was put in danger in front of everybody.

44
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,850
Not to mention with such a disturbance!

45
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,420
Regardless of who looks at it, it will seem like I tried to assassinate the king.

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,970
I will solve this situation.

47
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,500
- I pray. 
 - I pray.

48
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,010
I pray to the spirits of Heaven and Earth

49
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,500
that our king's body

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,680
will be safely protected by you.

51
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,410
- I pray. 
 - I pray.

52
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,200
I desperately pray.

53
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,140
That our king's body

54
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,080
will be safely protected by you.

55
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,930
I did not know they'd go as far as that!

56
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,550
The king that they themselves chose,

57
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,970
they'd want to get rid of him before he became a problem.

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,020
If the king is not able to wake up...

59
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,420
With Eui Bin,

60
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,960
there will be nothing we can do.

61
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,060
In the process of trying to capture the queen,

62
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,900
we have also been caught in the trap.

63
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,500
I pray.

64
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,590
I pray.

65
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,350
Take a rest now.

66
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,640
You're going to faint at this rate.

67
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,460
If something goes wrong with the king,

68
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,560
I will not be able to live anyway.

69
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,630
Even if I die,

70
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,390
I must get revenge on whoever did this to the king before I die.

71
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,280
The palace...

72
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,820
and those people

73
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,290
made us this spiteful.

74
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,400
Your Majesty, the Director of the Uigeumbu is here.

75
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,840
Cheoljong—

76
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
Is the king... okay?

77
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,820
Right now at Huijeongjeon, 
  (King's bed-chamber and office) 

78
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,310
Prince Youngpyeong has restricted all access.

79
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,980
So far no information is available for anyone outside of there yet.

80
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,140
- I must go myself— 
 - Do not go.

81
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,630
They'll let me in.

82
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,950
I'm still his wife.

83
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,770
Do not go.

84
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,210
He tried to kill you himself.

85
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,820
It wouldn't be enough for me to kill him with my own hands.

86
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
So-yong...

87
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,300
I think... I need to rest alone.

88
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,890
There shouldn't be a problem, right?

89
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,470
Of course.

90
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,380
Reveal who is behind this.

91
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,640
We are innocent.

92
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,520
We even risked our lives to protect the king.

93
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,690
We are Royal Guards.

94
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,470
What is your excuse for these false identities?

95
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,280
While you were using those as an excuse to capture us,

96
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,050
look at what happened to the king.

97
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,130
If anyone is behind this, it would be your father who also captured us with those false identities.

98
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,350
Kim Jwa-geun!

99
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,900
It is Kim Jwa-geun.

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,350
You're quite clever.

101
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,100
We found it.

102
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,960
Like you said, the incense holder was full of potassium nitrate used for gunpowder and not sand.

103
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
How did you know?

104
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,130
- What happened? 
 - They did not easily open their mouths.

105
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,080
As expected. Anything else?

106
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
Nothing as of yet.

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,590
We must hurry and find the criminal so that this commotion will die down.

108
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,530
Hurry and find out who was behind this as soon as possible.

109
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,070
Yes.

110
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,450
We must find the source of the potassium nitrate.

111
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,560
Investigate alone and quietly.

112
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

113
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,040
Lord, please forgive me!

114
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,240
What are you doing? There are many people watching.

115
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,820
Please... Please listen to me.

116
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,370
It will only take a moment. Only a moment.

117
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,790
Only a moment.

118
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,510
I only kept the ledger just in case,

119
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,440
I never intended to use it.

120
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,430
Also, our queen doesn't even know the ledger exists.

121
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,010
Where is the ledger right now?

122
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,160
Wasn't it you who had it?

123
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,300
Then all that is left... is only the king.

124
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,520
You have left a trace of evidence that threatens our lineage.

125
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,350
For that reason alone, we're not safe and sound!

126
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,110
I'll do anything. If My Lord says to die, I shall die.

127
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,810
Right here.

128
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,360
I will hang myself right here.

129
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,970
I will hang myself...

130
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,910
Your forgiveness, My Lord.

131
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,970
Please, My Lord...

132
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,180
Your Majesty!

133
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,490
Your Majesty, are you awake?

134
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,900
Hyung-nim...

135
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,700
Yes, please go ahead.

136
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,120
Why is it so loud?

137
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,450
It's so loud my head hurts.

138
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,030
I can't hear anything.

139
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,120
Please get rid of these sounds.

140
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,430
I should have explained more

141
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,060
that I wasn't trying to kill him. I should've explained myself somehow.

142
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,270
 He tried to kill you himself. 

143
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,000
  It wouldn't have been enough for me to kill him with my own hands. 

144
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,940
  You must face the consequences of losing your temper. 

145
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Was the whole Ansong Kim clan behind this?

146
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,030
Or which side?

147
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,990
 Your Majesty! 

148
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,090
Your Majesty, the king has regained consciousness.

149
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,270
I thought he regained consciousness.

150
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,470
He just fell asleep.

151
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,020
Why did you wrap him in so many bandages?

152
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,430
It looks so painful.

153
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm sorry, but due to the explosion, his hearing has been damaged.

154
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,950
You're not saying...

155
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,570
that he won't be able to hear again?

156
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,560
Only time will tell.

157
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,220
All of you leave the room for now.

158
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,400
Yes.

159
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,860
Will you say even this was not the deed of the Ansong Kim clan?

160
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,080
You said to me that I would lose someone important.

161
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,150
Now, there is no one left that is important to me.

162
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,790
So, please...

163
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,710
stop it.

164
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,810
Your Majesty, you can rest assured now.

165
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Who is it...

166
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,840
Your Majesty, are you regaining consciousness?

167
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,500
I will give you some water.

168
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,100
    

169
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,940
You're on your way back from seeing the king.

170
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,950
While wanting to comfort Your Majesty, who must be surprised due to the accident today, I also had something to ask.

171
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,680
Your father has lost an important item.

172
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,230
It seems the king has secretly taken it.

173
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,050
Do you know anything about this?

174
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,680
  I'll bring someone. 

175
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,940
  No! Nobody must know that I am here. 

176
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,930
  No-Nobody.. 

177
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,950
You do know?

178
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,980
Do you remember my words saying we have no weaknesses?

179
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,930
If anything becomes a problem, we will cut it out.

180
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,400
I will ask one last time,

181
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,520
do you know anything?

182
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:55,350
When I was at my parent's house, I saved the king who had collapsed by the well.

183
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,820
Probably then...

184
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,270
There was a time I made a suggestion to Your Majesty.

185
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm talking about the night you fell in the lake.

186
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,930
I'll help you remember.

187
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,830
I requested that you supervise your husband.

188
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,440
That request...

189
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,790
Would you like to accept it now?

190
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,360
Then, what will be guaranteed to me?

191
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,700
What do you want?

192
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,560
Guarantee my safety.

193
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,390
My Lady, it's time to go back to your quarters.

194
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,690
   

195
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,880
   

196
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,800
Cheoljong, I'm sorry.

197
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,800
You lose anyway.

198
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,010
The winning side is my side.

199
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,160
Kim So-yong... You already gave up on your life.

200
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:28,670
Since I have to continue, I'm going to at least live and eat well by myself.

201
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,840
If I want to do that, I really need to know what happened that night.

202
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
  You will also lose someone important to you. 

203
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,040
  You need to love me! 

204
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,820
  Is that an order? 

205
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,590
  There is not one thing that is not a lie. 

206
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,910
  You are definitely So-yong. 

207
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,350
  Did you rise up to this position by yourself? 

208
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,380
  Even if you die, die in the palace. 

209
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,680
  By tomorrow, you will be queen. 

210
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,350
 By tomorrow, you will be queen. 

211
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,850
 From now on, you need to let me know the king's every move. 

212
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,440
 Are you telling me to spy on the king? 

213
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,250
 Not spying, just monitoring your husband. 

214
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,920
 I do not want to. 

215
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,430
 The thing you want is the queen's position and the king. 

216
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,530
 If you want both, then you must do as I say. 

217
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,420
 It's just like what you did in the past. 

218
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,700
 Like when you let me know that the king was trapped in the well. 

219
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,530
  If you do fulfill your duties as queen, then the king becomes useless. 

220
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,930
 If something becomes useless, it must be thrown away. 

221
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,250
 If you are trying to hurt the king, I will not stay still. 

222
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,510
 What will you do if you don't stay still? You are greatly mistaken. 

223
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,770
  You think the position of queen has some kind of great power? 

224
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:46,050
 The queen is merely a very fertile land that gives birth to a royal prince. 

225
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,170
 Even if you become queen, with a woman's body 

226
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,710
 what kind of power do you think you'll have? 

227
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,370
It's not just because of Kim Jwa-geun's words,

228
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,840
even in this short amount of time inside the palace,

229
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,420
I know enough of how this place is.

230
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,430
This whole place killed Kim So-yong.

231
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,540
Your Majesty!

232
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,940
Your Majesty!

233
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,130
Your Majesty!

234
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,080
Your Majesty, what are you doing here so late at night?

235
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,540
And why are you so wet?

236
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,870
Don't tell me... in the lake again?

237
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,020
Why do you keep doing this?

238
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,200
In times like these, you must stay even more alert.

239
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,070
Why do you think I did all sorts of things?

240
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,960
For what did I see those unbecoming things!

241
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,860
Why did you do that?

242
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,230
You did it to pile up your own wealth.

243
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,610
You sold your only daughter to feed your greed.

244
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,810
Why did you always tell me to become queen in order to bring pride to my ancestry and father?

245
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,390
Why did you tell me I could do anything once I became queen?

246
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,630
To me who was already struggling with guilt for my mother's death,

247
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,410
why did you keep telling me your own dream?

248
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,520
Do you know what kind of mindset I was in when I flung myself in this lake?

249
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,020
Everything I had thought I lived for was a lie.

250
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,770
Not even the dream I dreamed was mine.

251
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,140
I failed in everything.

252
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,980
That is why I threw myself away.

253
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,310
The day you achieved your dream, I lost the most important person to me.

254
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,170
That person was me! The person who pushed me into the lake was you!

255
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:26,630
Children always see their parents as easy. I shouldn't have blamed my father like that.

256
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,020
Your Majesty!

257
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,560
I have something to tell you.

258
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,940
I know you are someone that would do anything for me.

259
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,880
I mean, I know now, because I regained my memories.

260
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,850
From now on, do not do anything.

261
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,380
If it is for me, do not do anything anymore.

262
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,840
That is for my sake.

263
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,740
So-yong...

264
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,410
Don't call my name.

265
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:31,070
From now on, I am just the queen that you as the Director of the Royal Investigation Bureau serves.

266
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,160
   

267
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,030
♫   Shivering in the frozen hours   ♫

268
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,100
♫   Weary while walking through the night, I stopped   ♫

269
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,530
♫   In the longing of the wind  ♫

270
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,380
♫   I am wandering looking for you   ♫

271
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,010
♫  Where are you  ♫

272
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,650
Since you can't hear me, I'm going to be honest.

273
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,290
You've got to be a coward like this to live long.

274
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,690
♫  Here I am  ♫

275
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm going to betray you.

276
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,550
I've decided to choose the way for me to survive.

277
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,510
♫   Still I am   ♫

278
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,860
So don't you die, either.

279
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,780
Brush it off and wake up fine

280
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,540
so that I can stab you in the back.

281
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,950
♫   Even if the whole world stops  ♫

282
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,830
♫   Here I am   ♫

283
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,940
♫   Here I am   ♫

284
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:48,790
You were right. The king is not all that he seems.

285
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,100
My apologies.

286
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,510
What do you think of today's accident?

287
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,780
- There was potassium nitrate at the scene. 
 - Potassium nitrate?

288
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,190
Yes. There are two kinds of potassium nitrate used in Joseon.

289
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,260
One is imported from China and the other is domestically produced.

290
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,400
There is a slight difference in the ingredients,

291
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,020
but the one that was found this time was domestic.

292
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,430
Production of potassium nitrate is part of military duties.

293
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,000
That is managed by the Military Affairs Panel.

294
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,730
Run by my father's right-hand man.

295
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,300
That means...

296
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,090
My father directly put the king in his position.

297
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,630
Before the king revealed his true self and became a problem, he probably wanted to remove him.

298
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,470
And he probably will end things by charging the Royal Guards with falsifying their identities.

299
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,860
The last time you came to see me, there must have been something you wanted.

300
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,980
What is it you wanted?

301
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,850
The thing I want is...

302
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,410
the king.

303
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,590
I cannot stop.

304
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,750
So-yong, if your heart is like that, even more so I can't.

305
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,170
I am here to tell you what the queen did yesterday.

306
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,560
The person who saved the ruined banquet was the queen.

307
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,650
Do you think I will believe your words?

308
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,870
You probably think the person who hurt the king was me.

309
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,540
If you slightly dig into it, all will be revealed.

310
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,030
Just like how you tried to ruin the banquet.

311
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,340
Just because the position of queen will become empty—

312
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,700
I do not want her position.

313
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,980
I just want the queen to disappear from the king's side.

314
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,900
The king... has the queen in his heart?

315
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,650
   

316
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,240
You've become haggard over the past few days.

317
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,100
Are you that worried about the king?

318
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,040
Oh, yes.

319
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,230
It hasn't been that long and you've grown quite close.

320
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,980
I...

321
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:46,810
Actually, I have done a disservice to our ancestors.

322
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,120
I recorded all the wealth that our family wrongfully gained.

323
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,150
- But I lost it. 
 - What did you say?

324
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,240
But I know where the ledger is.

325
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,310
Now, we just have to retrieve the ledger and get rid of it.

326
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,590
However, please save the queen.

327
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,990
Suddenly it's the queen?

328
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,330
The one who has the ledger is the king.

329
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,310
The queen has nothing to do with this.

330
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,900
The king deceived us and the queen.

331
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,430
Everyone was deceived by the king...

332
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,870
I-I will receive any punishment.

333
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,540
However,

334
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,810
just not my So-yong.

335
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,840
At least our queen,

336
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,620
please... please save her.

337
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,670
Father.

338
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,240
Have you been at the Royal Investigation Bureau all this time?

339
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,420
Yes. This is quite a big case so there was much to do.

340
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,750
In this case, all fingers point to me,

341
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,690
but you have said nothing regarding this.

342
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,830
Do not worry.

343
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,190
Since the Royal Investigation Bureau is in charge of investigating this case,

344
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:15,310
if you are being framed, I will find out who the real person is behind it.

345
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,740
I feel well taken care of.

346
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:25,080
Some time ago, you said you had found the size of the dream you wanted.

347
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,690
How big is the size of that dream of yours?

348
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,970
My dream is just...

349
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,210
to resemble you, even if only by half.

350
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,250
It's late. Go rest.

351
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,890
 Don't come near. If you follow me, I'm going to kill myself. 

352
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,200
 So-yong! 

353
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,550
I know... what makes you move.

354
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,030
Where has the queen gone so early in the morning?

355
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,650
She is in the royal kitchen. Now then.

356
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,020
That's fine...

357
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,160
I was going to ask her to bring some food as soon as I woke up,

358
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,010
but it seems she's already serving her grandmother-in-law, my goodness.

359
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,580
I was surprised! What are you doing so early in the morning?

360
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,370
These days, I'm so depressed and can't sleep.

361
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:52,290
That's why like a morning prayer I'm making something that needs to be stirred five trillion times.

362
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,800
The color of the porridge is a bit...

363
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,990
It's not porridge, it's potage crécy.   (French Carrot Soup) 

364
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,660
Why are you spitting in the morning?

365
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,990
It's carrot soup.

366
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,580
W-Wait! How do you make it?

367
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,940
Dice carrots and onions and boil them with water for one hour.

368
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,540
Then you grind that with a millstone just like you would grind all your fears and anxieties into powder.

369
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,480
Then, you have to keep stirring so it doesn't burn or clump up on a low fire

370
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,570
with a spiritual state of persistence.

371
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,420
There, you flavor it with salt.

372
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,540
add a bit of milk.

373
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,790
With milk, it's done.

374
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,470
No.

375
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,930
Beforehand, you need to boil various vegetables and strain them to make a broth.

376
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,150
Then with that,

377
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,170
you mix a little bit and the flavor becomes richer.

378
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,740
You went through all of that just to put a little bit in?

379
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,750
I told you, this is something like a morning prayer.

380
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,790
How much dedication you put into this!

381
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,480
If His Majesty eats this, he will surely wake up and feel better in no time.

382
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,260
No, he won't.

383
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,820
  Better to do it all at once since I have to please both sides anyway. 

384
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,310
  Just because I said that one thing last time, 

385
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,750
  she's making me share a table with my mother-in-law? 

386
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,010
  That wretched mouth that dared tell others I was old, 

387
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,600
  I had to look at as soon as I woke up. 

388
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,880
What is this?

389
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,110
It's called "brunch."

390
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,590
Brun...

391
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:37,690
Buranchi, a breakfast among women where they build friendly relations.  (Buranchi - Japanese for brunch) 

392
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,430
Who doesn't know brunch?

393
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,260
It's not like you're a person from Gojoseon. 
   (Meaning ancient state, an old person) 

394
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,320
  That wench. 

395
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,840
I've done this before,

396
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,920
but it's been a while.

397
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,880
  That wench. 

398
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,470
It's a soup made of carrots.

399
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,990
It has many ingredients good for the eyes.

400
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,770
Is that so?

401
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,710
You should have a lot of it, Queen Dowager. It seems nothing can hurt your eyes. 
  (A reprimand for someone who's crazy and acts rashly) 

402
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,950
If that is the case, the queen should eat all of it.

403
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,380
  What is this? Why are they being so fierce? 

404
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,260
It tastes good.

405
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,030
It seems edible.

406
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,710
From now on, I will arrange more of these meetings.

407
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,100
 - That wench! 
 - That wench! 

408
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,690
Then, I'll get some drinks

409
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,510
I will be back.

410
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,370
The rumors about the queen's cooking skills were over-exaggerated.

411
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,110
Being able to recognize good food is also dignity.

412
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,710
Just because of this mere skill, you're condoning the queen?

413
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,250
Since the source of talk about the queen is you,

414
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,650
I cannot believe them.

415
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,610
Since this as well comes from my mouth so you might not believe it, but

416
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,040
every night the king and queen secretly

417
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,210
exchange letters.

418
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,280
What exactly do you think they are exchanging words about?

419
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,970
  I am sending in the drinks. 

420
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:45,240
This drink is wine mixed with various fruits boiled with cinnamon and other spices.

421
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,890
Alcohol in the morning?

422
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:52,080
The strength of the wine has been cooked off and all that remains are the ingredients that help maintain youth.

423
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,440
This is not just a drink but can also be considered medicine.

424
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,150
Warmed up wine.

425
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,380
How in the world did you come up with this idea?

426
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,610
Where do you get your inspiration for cooking?

427
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,990
Should I say mere inspiration or creations?

428
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:23,210
If I look at the ingredients, I automatically just come up with ideas that best save the natural flavor.

429
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,440
 This is a time period where they're cautious of outsiders, 

430
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,080
 so I can't say it's from the French. 

431
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,330
Miss.

432
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,530
Hello, Young Master.

433
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,310
I have something to say, so I've been waiting.

434
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,310
What? What do you need to say?

435
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,430
Ever since I saw the king's accident,

436
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,920
my thoughts have been complicated.

437
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,500
You cannot see the things that life will throw your way

438
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,580
and perhaps my life can end tomorrow.

439
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,960
If my life ends tomorrow,

440
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,390
what will I regret the most?

441
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,390
That would be my hesitation

442
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,160
that prevented me from letting you know how I felt.

443
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,850
Rather than a flamboyant confession, I feel a word of sincerity is more important.

444
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,120
With that said,

445
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,090
I love you, Hong Yeon.

446
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,220
- Not me. 
 - Huh?

447
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,660
About the potassium nitrate.The amount of potassium nitrate produced at the mill in Gyeongsang province

448
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,830
and the amount of potassium nitrate produced for gunpowder differs.

449
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,840
I knew it.

450
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,670
- Is the king's condition still the same? 
 - Yes.

451
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,520
I heard he lost his hearing so I'm worried even if he does wake up.

452
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,330
The accident the king suffered...

453
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:18,310
With an explosion of that size, is it possibly potassium nitrate?

454
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm not sure. It could have been sulfur or gas that is prone to exploding.

455
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,190
Sulfur has a strong smell so the king would have recognized it

456
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,920
and it would have been hard for gas to explode all at once without leaking.

457
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,920
The criminals have not confessed anything even with our interrogation, so it is hard to say.

458
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,980
 If I look at the ingredients, I automatically just come up with ideas that best save the natural flavor. 

459
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,830
- It can't be. 
 - Have the seven criminals who committed treason

460
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,270
revealed who is behind all of this?

461
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,530
It seems as though those who were dissatisfied with the present politics have united

462
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,220
and planned all of this.

463
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,070
Are you saying there is no other person behind all of this?

464
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,990
With such a big issue pertaining to the king, there is no way that is true.

465
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,980
It is usually the ones that have nothing to lose that must be feared the most.

466
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,510
Since it's too late to be treated like a human, let's make a big deal out of this and turn the tables!

467
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,320
Isn't that your attitude regarding this?

468
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,400
Indeed, there's the king's half-brother, Lee Won-kyung.

469
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,930
It was a lowly ranked soldier, a traitor, who led a rebellion to have Lee Won-kyung be a king.

470
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,460
As the king is unconscious, the more we wait on this issue, the more of a hassle it will become.

471
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:08,820
With that, the seven traitors

472
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,580
will be executed today.

473
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,770
For committing treason by putting the king's life in danger,

474
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,400
all of you will be executed.

475
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,820
Do you have any last words?

476
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,940
If they are executed,

477
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,440
the real person behind all of this will never be found.

478
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,220
He's saying there is no one else behind this!

479
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:50,980
- It is a rash decision. 
 - It is a decision made with endless nights of investigating.

480
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,700
 My goodness... 

481
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,450
Execute them.

482
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,480
Stop right there!

483
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,830
This is a process of fulfilling a royal decree.

484
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,700
Are you planning to disturb this process?

485
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:12,730
Release these innocent men at once. This is the real royal decree.

486
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,280
I'm late.

487
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,240
Your Majesty...

488
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,910
It was said you were sick in bed.

489
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:38,730
With so much youth and liveliness, I shook it off and woke up.

490
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,370
I figured that time was too precious to just be laying in bed focusing on treatment.

491
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:50,960
I've found out some things about those planning a rebellion against me all this time.

492
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,230
So first, I investigated and observed all of you.

493
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,910
Are you saying you inspected us?

494
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,910
Someone attempted a rebellion.

495
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:09,260
Right now, my life as king is less important than your personal life.

496
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,970
Is that what you are saying?

497
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:15,000
N-No, that is...

498
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,980
If you have nothing to hide, there is nothing to be afraid of.

499
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:27,460
Do not worry. I have found out the person behind all of this.

500
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,240
 - What? 
 - What is he saying? 

501
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:40,470
In the incense holder used at the ritual, a good deal of domestic potassium nitrate was found inside.

502
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,260
 Potassium nitrate? 

503
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,680
 The incense will become a giant bomb. 

504
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,990
 This is too dangerous. 

505
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,680
 It is as certain as it is dangerous. 

506
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,250
While finding the source of the potassium nitrate,

507
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:07,440
we gained information from a nearby port that potassium nitrate was being privately traded.

508
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,010
 But what are you going to use this huge amount of potassium nitrate for? 

509
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:21,030
 I'm going to use it when we plan to invade Joseon again. 

510
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,490
 Thank you. Thank you.  
 (Arigato is "Thank you" in Japanese) 

511
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,650
 Thank you?  

512
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,150
 Thank you!  

513
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,160
 - Thank you? 
 - Thank you! Thank you!  

514
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,220
Thank you!

515
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,120
Where exactly did that potassium nitrate come from?

516
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,190
Potassium nitrate is produced only for the military and cannot and should not be privately made,

517
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,890
since it is such a dangerous, but also precious material.

518
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,620
With that, while digging through all of Joseon's potassium nitrate mills,

519
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,980
we found something unusual.

520
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,420
At a certain provincial potassium nitrate mill,

521
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,710
it was found that a small amount of potassium nitrate was repeatedly stolen.

522
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:10,370
The small amount of potassium nitrate that was stolen at first, gradually grew bigger each time.

523
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,690
Almost like how...

524
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,920
black greed  (evil)  increases.

525
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,240
Do you know when this embezzlement of potassium nitrate started, Training General Kim Jwa-geun?

526
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:34,560
It was the year I became king. 
  (Kiyu-nyun - 1849) 

527
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,370
It is also the year you became the General of Military Training.

528
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:42,710
Your Majesty, he is being framed!

529
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,790
Silence!

530
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,530
You, who was in charge of the potassium nitrate,

531
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,200
having planned a rebellion with Kim Jwa-geun, committed treason as well!

532
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,880
 I will use the false identities of the Royal Guard as bait. 

533
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,020
  For sure, word of the identity fabrication has already reached Kim Jwa-geun's ears. 

534
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,060
  You all will have to undergo unbearable torture. 

535
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:13,090
  However, please endure. I will save you no matter what. 

536
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,560
Your Majesty, please be understanding of the frustration I feel toward this unfairness!

537
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:33,170
If you talk of unfairness in front of me again, I will make you drink poison!

538
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,870
Potassium nitrate was sold to anyone offering enough money!

539
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:47,740
To thieves and even to the Japanese military! What is this, if not the downfall of Joseon?

540
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,580
Who in this place also conspired with them?

541
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:08,100
Training General Kim Jwa-geun as well as Minister of War Kim Chang-hyuk,

542
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:14,330
these two criminals stole from our country, weakened our defenses,

543
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:19,620
and planned a rebellion against me, the king.

544
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,390
They are criminals that have committed treason.

545
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:27,710
  Then the name of this operation, what should it be? 

546
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,570
 Manipulation. 

547
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,320
 The name of this operation is Flaming Red Manipulation. 

548
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:49,190
Considering all of these crimes, the two criminals will not only be removed from office,

549
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,840
but I also order them to be sent back to their hometowns.

550
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,190
 - Grand Royal Queen Dowager! 
 - Grand Royal Queen Dowager! 

551
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,620
What do you think you are doing?

552
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,780
Why are you so emotional!

553
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,090
You've suffered an accident and lost the ability to judge.

554
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,420
Abide by your position!

555
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,170
Is that so?

556
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,330
If you say it like that,

557
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:30,230
I feel like you yourself, Grand Royal Queen Dowager, has also lost the ability to judge.

558
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:36,390
I can no longer allow you to oversee politics.

559
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,750
I request that you withdraw your regency. 
 (Where a relative governs until the king is old enough to reign.) 

560
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,060
It is time for me to make all the decisions by myself.

561
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,250
King!

562
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:56,260
I should be making Kim Jwa-geun drink poison and get rid of his family for three generations,

563
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,660
but seeing you and the queen's face,

564
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,300
I am letting him go easily.

565
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,970
Do you not like it?

566
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:09,920
Are you trying to make a deal with my younger brother's life?

567
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,580
A deal is only valid when you have the power to choose.

568
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,200
Your Majesty!

569
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,960
I, Kim Jwa-geun, am in agony due to being wrongly framed,

570
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,250
but I will accept your royal decree in order to show my loyalty.

571
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,170
That is a relief.

572
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,600
I was worried you would be greedy.

573
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,650
I have no regrets about my position.

574
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:40,690
But for an honorable exile, please give me the chance to clear my name.

575
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:44,600
I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate,

576
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,960
All right.

577
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,050
However, if the Office of the Inspector General does not proceed with the investigation by tomorrow then

578
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:55,250
I will, with the king's power, erase your name

579
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,960
and not only will those who have evaded this problem,

580
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,020
but all of you here will be removed from your offices!

581
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,500
 - We thank you, Your Majesty! 
 - We thank you, Your Majesty! 

582
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,290
You have lost, little brother!

583
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,710
You have been taken out by the one you yourself made a king.

584
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:32,430
I did not know that the king would plan his own assassination.

585
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,930
Who exactly do you think planned this trap?

586
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:43,240
I believed in you, Little Brother, and left matters to you. How I lack the ability to see people.

587
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,400
Confucius said a person's heart is as rough as the mountains,

588
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,800
and the ability to see through the heart is as hard as the sky.

589
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,530
There have been mistakes made on both my part and yours.

590
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:02,330
Your Highness also trusted the queen with finding concubines.

591
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,150
But instead, she chose to empower the king.

592
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:10,400
In addition, the one who saved the banquet I ruined was the queen.

593
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,920
What's scarier is an internal enemy.

594
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,610
 My Lady! 

595
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,540
The king must have regained his consciousness!

596
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:44,310
A husband must wake up in order for me to spy on him.

597
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,060
If he doesn't wake up, I'll become useless.

598
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,790
If I become useless, I'll be thrown aside.

599
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:56,830
If I'm thrown aside, with no chance at revenge, I'll have to open a soup shop to live, then I'll own a popular restaurant...

600
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,590
That really doesn't sound too bad.

601
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,830
Your Majesty!

602
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:06,120
The king... The king, he...

603
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,430
He's awake.

604
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,310
- Really? 
 - Yes.

605
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:16,770
His hearing returned, so he just went to the court session as well.

606
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,090
I was so scared.

607
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,200
I shouldn't be here like this.

608
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,460
Your Majesty!

609
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,860
I'm in such a rush.

610
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,810
Your Majesty.

611
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,050
What a relief.

612
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,770
Seriously, what a relief.

613
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,800
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

614
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,260
It's a relief.

615
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,340
I'll do it.

616
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,660
My King!

618
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,310
It's all right now.

619
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:17,090
It's all right now that you're awake.

620
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:23,000
I won't lose you again.

621
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,900
Bin.

622
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,440
    

623
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,500
Your Majesty, you said you were going to visit the king. You shouldn't be here like this.

624
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,190
One more cup.

625
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:47,480
It's uncomfortable for me to see him sober right now.

626
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,480
Please stop drinking. You shouldn't be doing this, Your Majesty.

627
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,060
Court Lady Choi, you can get off work. Go home!

628
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,890
I'll drink it all to get rid of it.

629
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,310
C-Court Lady Choi—

630
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,370
Court Lady Choi.

631
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:13,640
This royal kitchen is loaded with tons of alcohol, you know?

632
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,550
What's so uncomfortable?

633
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,090
What's so uncomfortable is...

634
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:28,640
You're right. Why should I be uncomfortable?

635
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,230
I'm confident! Let's go see the king.

636
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,070
Not like this. Please sober up first.

637
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,730
Okay, let's go tomorrow.

638
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,440
Procrastinate until tomorrow and start your diet tomorrow!

639
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,400
There's a tomorrow for us.

640
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,080
Royal Chef, another bottle.

641
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,480
Does she think this is a tavern?

642
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,170
Hurry.

643
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,560
Court Lady Chun!

644
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,370
   

645
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,580
Your Highness!

646
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,920
Your Highness.

647
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,700
   
 (The missing secret ledger) 

648
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,720
It came out of Daejojeon.

649
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,860
As expected, the king and queen are one.

650
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,850
The queen is completely broken.

651
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:16,320
A broken item must be replaced with a new one.

652
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:22,310
However, to use the item to its full merit until its last moment,

653
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:25,110
we can just use it as kindling wood for the fire.

654
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,900
Shall we use real arsenic this time?

655
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:43,390
Since the queen has such a great interest in food, we will return the favor with a precious meal.

656
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,270
Are you going to leave the king alone?

657
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:50,550
If we want to leave the king in his position, we need to ruin him.

658
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:55,690
If the queen meets her demise as soon as he gives his heart to her, he'll realize it gruesomely.

659
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:59,290
He'll learn that everyone who takes his side will be miserable.

660
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,760
 

661
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,550
   

662
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:51,810
 Isn't it such a miracle that there's a tomorrow guaranteed for us? 

663
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:01,120
Let's go for Round 2!

664
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,650
We should have a party, celebrating our king's recovery!

665
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,390
Please lower your voice, Your Majesty.

666
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,570
My King!

667
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,130
My King!

668
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:15,000
You shouldn't call him like that.

669
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,120
Open up.

670
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,960
Open up.

671
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,450
   

672
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:33,460
   

673
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:41,540
   

674
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,330
I fell fast asleep.

675
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,870
Were you watching me this whole time?

676
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,960
How come you're always like this? Worrying about me,

677
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,410
trying to understand me.

678
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:27,260
Come to think of it, when I came here you were the first person I saw.

679
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,680
There are so many things I'm grateful for to you.

680
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,020
Even when I tried to leave here, you made me hesitate.

681
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,090
Because I would never be able to see you again.

682
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,390
Hong Yeon.

683
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,090
Are you awake?

684
01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:01,080
    

685
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:09,710


686
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,690
 I'm sure this woman's soul controlled my body. 

687
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,980
 Why do you keep avoiding me? 

688
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:23,020
 What is it you want to ask me? Did you like it? 

689
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,800
 You! I told you this was forbidden! 

690
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,930
 Hugging me, laughing at me, laying down next to me are all forbidden! 

691
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,060
 I forbid you to forbid these things. 

692
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,430
 The goods are prepared. 

693
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,420
 What do you see? 

694
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,900
 Someone will die in the palace today. 

695
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,380
 What do you mean they're trying to get rid of the queen? 

696
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,930
 Today I specially prepared ice, it's considered to be more valuable than gold. 

697
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,850
 Your Majesty! 

698
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,220
 My Queen! 

699
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,450
♫  Instead of the sorrow in your eyes   ♫
