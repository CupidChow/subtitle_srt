1
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,640
(This drama is purely fictional, and the characters, groups, events, etc. that appear have nothing to do with history)

2
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,140
Your Highness

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,800
Your Highness

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,720
Your Highness

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,090
We still have tomorrow

6
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,990
What a miracle it is

7
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,010
Too dangerous

8
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,830
Maybe it will explode again.

9
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,100
Your Highness, Your Highness

10
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,790
Absolutely not

11
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,920
Concubine Yi cannot

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
Your Highness

13
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,610
Your Highness, are you okay?

14
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,810
Your Highness Your Highness

15
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,000
Protect His Highness

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,570
Your Highness, are you okay?

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,330
Niangniang

18
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,160
Please go away, my lady.

19
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,520
Your Highness

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,280
quick

21
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:01,513
Can't

22
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,533
I have to save him.

23
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,433
Niangniang

24
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:04,943
Absolutely not

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,480
Don't mind His Highness's business.

26
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,710
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,980
Listen to Dad

28
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,010
Details later

29
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,460
Take care of yourself now

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,050
You guys take the queen to the Dazao Palace

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,260
Niangniang

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,120
Absolutely not

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,320
Let me go

34
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,310
Niangniang

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,390
Let me go

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,390
Niangniang

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,730
Niangniang

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,940
Please

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,700
However, we

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,870
Until tomorrow never comes

41
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,100
I realized it was a miracle.

42
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,780
We are just too stupid

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,730
You don't know how to cherish until you lose it

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,530
(Episode 13 No Tomorrow)

45
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,650
(Episode 13)

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,780
Who dared to try to assassinate His Majesty in the palace?

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,590
Once a suspicious person is found

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
Kill without mercy

49
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,110
Who did this?

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,970
We must find out

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,330
Is this what you prepared, brother?

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,670
Why on earth did you plan such a thing?

53
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,350
How do you want to bear the consequences?

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,840
Calm down

55
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,030
Can I calm down now?

56
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,810
The Lord's life was in danger in front of everyone.

57
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,850
And it's so noisy

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,870
Anyone who sees this will think I am assassinating the Lord.

59
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,450
Let my brother handle this.

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,810
Please, please, please

61
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,370
I beg the gods

62
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,920
Please bless our Lord's body

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,890
Please, please, please

64
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,690
I beg you

65
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,590
Please bless us

66
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,690
His Majesty's Jade Body

67
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,700
I didn't expect it to go this far.

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,630
My Lord, who was put on the throne by my own hands

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm going to die before I even make a fist

70
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,010
If the Lord never wakes up again

71
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,790
Then a mere concubine Yi

72
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,180
There's nothing we can do.

73
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,660
I wanted to deal with the trap in the middle hall.

74
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,430
But we tripped ourselves

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,210
Please

76
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,770
Please

77
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,990
Please

78
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,110
It's time to take a break.

79
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,040
If this continues, even you will fall ill.

80
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,640
if

81
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,450
Your Highness, something is really wrong.

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,840
I don't want to live anyway.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,990
I

84
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,860
Even if I die

85
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,820
I must avenge His Highness.

86
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,500
This is the palace

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Those people

88
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,650
Makes us so vicious

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,640
Niangniang

90
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,850
The deputy general of the Yijinfu requested an audience

91
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,400
Cheoljong

92
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,960
Your Highness

93
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,540
Are you okay?

94
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,460
Yongpingjun stood in front of the Heejeongjeon Palace and prohibited anyone from entering or leaving.

95
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,130
No news yet

96
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,230
I want to go over and take a look

97
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,350
Please don't go

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,460
He'll at least let me in.

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,170
I am his wife anyway.

100
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,910
Don't go

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,800
He even wanted to kill you before

102
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,070
Even if I cut him into pieces, it wouldn't be enough to relieve my hatred.

103
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,180
Zhao Rong

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,530
I want to rest alone

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,850
Your Highness

106
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,940
There won't be any problem.

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,850
certainly

108
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,370
Tell me the person behind the scenes

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
We are innocent

110
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,680
We are willing to sacrifice our lives for the Lord.

111
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,880
Guardian Warrior

112
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,410
How do you explain your false identity?

113
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,320
It is because you detained us on this ground.

114
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,450
Your Highness will become like that

115
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,780
Who is the person behind the scenes?

116
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,890
That's your father who caught us.

117
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,450
Kim Zuogen

118
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,140
The man behind the scenes is none other than Kim Jakeun

119
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,730
Crafty guy

120
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,290
Found it

121
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,730
As you said, the incense burner is not filled with sand.

122
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,420
But tobacco used in gunpowder

123
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,260
What are you going to do?

124
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,980
how's it going

125
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,260
They don't seem to speak easily.

126
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,510
I guess so

127
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,620
Is there anyone suspicious?

128
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,310
Not yet

129
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,410
The chaos can only be stopped by arresting the criminals as soon as possible.

130
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,660
We must find out the identity of the person behind this as soon as possible.

131
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,380
yes

132
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,260
To trace the origin of tobacco

133
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,140
Keep it secret

134
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,280
yes

135
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,520
grown ups

136
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,280
Please forgive me, please.

137
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,500
What are you doing?

138
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,930
Be careful, walls have ears

139
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,100
Please

140
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,580
Please listen to me, sir.

141
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,050
It only takes a moment

142
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,550
It only takes a moment. It only takes a moment.

143
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,040
It only takes a moment. It only takes a moment.

144
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,490
I just

145
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,790
Just put it in the account book just in case.

146
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,440
Never thought of using it

147
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,360
What's more, our queen didn't even know the existence of the account book.

148
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,230
What about the account book?

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,850
no

150
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,550
Didn't you take it away, sir?

151
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,300
Then it could only be

152
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,540
Your Highness

153
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,420
Ouch

154
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,580
The traces you left behind threaten our family.

155
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,950
This alone doesn't mean you're innocent.

156
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,540
I'm willing to do anything

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,180
If you let me die, I will die.

158
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,800
Here

159
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,610
I'm going to hang myself here.

160
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,230
Hanged himself

161
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,900
Please forgive me

162
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,170
grown ups

163
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,940
Please forgive me

164
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,340
Your Highness Your Highness

165
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,250
Your Highness

166
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,910
You woke up

167
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,770
Brother

168
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,640
Please tell me

169
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,690
Why is it so noisy?

170
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,870
The noise gave me a splitting headache

171
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,180
I can't hear anything

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,130
Please eliminate that sound.

173
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,770
I should explain a few more words to him.

174
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,500
He didn't want to kill me. I should explain a little more.

175
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,330
He even wanted to kill you before

176
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,100
Even if I cut him into pieces, it wouldn't be enough to relieve my hatred.

177
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,970
You should pay the price for your excessive bloodiness.

178
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,130
Could this be something planned by Ansong Jin?

179
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,220
Or maybe one party...

180
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,380
Niangniang

181
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,250
Her Majesty has regained consciousness.

182
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,130
Isn't he awake?

183
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,610
Just fell asleep again

184
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,980
Why are there so many bandages?

185
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,630
It's painful to look at.

186
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,100
I am afraid

187
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,820
Your Highness's hearing is affected by the explosion.

188
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,080
No

189
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,560
You'll never hear any sound.

190
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,840
Should also observe

191
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,290
You guys go out

192
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,840
yes

193
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,810
You also want to say

194
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,940
Isn't this what the Anseong Jin clan did?

195
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,190
You told me

196
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,530
I will lose someone important to me.

197
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,840
Now for me

198
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,460
No one important

199
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,960
So please

200
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,890
Let's stop here

201
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,000
Your Highness can rest assured now.

202
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,440
Your Highness

203
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,830
Are you awake?

204
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,840
I'll give you water

205
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,980
(Nave Dictionary)

206
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,190
Have you met His Highness?

207
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,610
I want to comfort the empress who was frightened today.

208
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,290
By the way, I have some questions for you.

209
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,300
So I came over

210
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,060
My uncle has lost something very important.

211
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,470
I always feel that the master secretly took it away

212
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,100
Did you know

213
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,550
Oh, I'll call someone over.

214
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,080
You can't let anyone know I'm here.

215
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,430
Can't

216
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,000
It seems you know

217
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,940
You remember I said we have no weaknesses

218
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,910
This sentence?

219
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,310
If it becomes a problem, it will be removed.

220
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,290
One last time to ask you

221
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,530
Did you know

222
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,070
When I was at my mother's house

223
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,270
Saved His Majesty from falling into a well

224
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,860
Maybe it was then

225
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,970
I once made a suggestion to you

226
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,580
The day you fell into the lake

227
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,810
Let me help you restore your memory.

228
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,780
I beg you to take good care of your husband.

229
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,850
Are you willing to accept it now?

230
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,390
That proposal

231
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,020
So what kind of guarantee can you give us?

232
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,990
What you want

233
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,750
Please keep me safe.

234
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,700
Your Majesty, it's time to go back to the palace.

235
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,650
(I came here for no reason)

236
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,180
Cheoljong

237
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,070
sorry

238
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,180
You will fail anyway

239
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,360
I can only stand on the side of the winner

240
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,340
Kim So-yong, it was you who gave up on yourself

241
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,910
I am continuing your life.

242
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,890
I want to live a good life with good food and drink

243
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,110
If I want to do this, I have to find out.

244
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,220
What happened that night?

245
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,770
You will lose someone important to you.

246
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,710
You have to love me

247
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,000
Are you ordering me?

248
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,840
None of them is not false

249
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,180
You are Zhaorong

250
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,820
Did you take this position yourself?

251
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,760
Even if I have to die, I want to die in the palace.

252
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,900
Tomorrow you will become the Queen Mother

253
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,370
Tomorrow you will become the Queen Mother

254
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,410
You will later

255
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,850
Tell me everything the Lord does.

256
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,290
You want me to monitor the master?

257
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,180
Is this what you mean?

258
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,530
It's not about surveillance, it's about keeping your husband in check.

259
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,090
No

260
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,100
Your Majesty, you want the position in the middle hall.

261
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,660
There is also the Lord, isn't there?

262
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,950
Want to get these two

263
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,820
You have to do as I say.

264
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,690
Just like before

265
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,170
Just like telling the Lord

266
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,230
Just like he was once locked in a well

267
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,650
If you can't play your role well,

268
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,700
The Lord is of no use to us.

269
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,140
If it's useless

270
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,920
Will be abandoned

271
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,940
If you want to harm the Lord

272
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,490
I won't stand idly by.

273
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,810
I won't stand by and watch. What else can you do?

274
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,470
You seem to have a huge illusion

275
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,400
Do you think the Middle Temple has great power?

276
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,250
The nave is just

277
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,390
The best land for producing princes

278
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,210
Sit in the nave

279
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,260
Through the body of a woman

280
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,050
What power do you think you have?

281
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,610
Not just because of what Kim Jageun said

282
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,890
In just a short time in the palace

283
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,950
I also fully understand the environment I am in.

284
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,690
This whole palace

285
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,690
Kill Kim So-yong

286
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,990
Niangniang

287
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,440
Niangniang

288
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,210
Niangniang

289
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,610
Niangniang

290
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,940
Niangniang

291
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,640
Where did you go so late at night?

292
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,560
but

293
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,840
Why is it soaking wet?

294
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,870
Could it be

295
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,450
Jump into the lake again

296
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,730
Why is it always like this?

297
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,890
The more this happens, the more we need to cheer up.

298
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
I until now

299
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,480
Why do you do anything?

300
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,340
Why did I see all the filth that I shouldn't have seen?

301
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,140
Why are you doing this?

302
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,750
This is to fill the warehouse with valuables.

303
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,590
To satisfy his greed, he sold his only daughter

304
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,090
Zhao Rong

305
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,700
Why do you always say that I want to be the middle nave and bring honor to my family and my father?

306
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,230
Why do you say that I can do anything as long as I become the middle temple?

307
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,880
Why do I feel so guilty about my mother's death?

308
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,820
Always talk about your dreams

309
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,810
Do you know how I felt when I jumped into the lake that night?

310
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,550
I've always thought that life is fake.

311
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,340
Even the dreams I have are not mine

312
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,700
Everything I have is a failure.

313
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,420
So you abandoned me

314
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,980
The day your dream comes true

315
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,860
I lost the person I cherished most

316
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,860
That's me

317
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,660
It was you, my father, who pushed me into the lake.

318
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,090
Children always think their parents are easy to bully

319
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,120
I shouldn't blame my father.

320
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,580
Niangniang

321
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,150
I have something to say

322
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,540
I know you'll do anything for me.

323
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,240
no

324
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,700
I see

325
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,570
Because I got my memory back

326
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,900
Please don't do anything in the future.

327
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,590
If it's for me

328
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,700
Don't do anything anymore

329
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,470
This is for my own good.

330
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,290
Zhao Rong

331
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,830
Please don't call my name

332
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,300
I will just

333
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,680
The Yijinfu will dress the empress.

334
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,550
(Nave Dictionary)

335
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,360
Because you can't hear me telling the truth

336
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,970
Originally, you have to be so despicable to live long

337
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,570
I will betray you

338
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,540
I chose the way I could survive

339
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,410
So you don't die either.

340
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,240
After waking up safely

341
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,730
Stabbed in the back

342
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,030
You are right.

343
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,330
What the Lord showed is not all

344
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,410
I am terrified

345
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,290
What do you think about today's accident?

346
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,960
Gunpowder was found at the scene

347
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,220
Gunpowder?

348
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,060
Yes

349
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,460
There are two kinds of gunpowder in Korea

350
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,770
Introduced from the Qing Dynasty

351
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,400
and those made in domestic gunpowder factories

352
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,620
Although the ingredients are slightly different

353
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,540
What we found this time

354
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,340
It's domestic stuff

355
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,520
The gunpowder factory was under the control of the military facilities.

356
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,590
That is managed by the Military Affairs Minister

357
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,210
It's my father's right arm

358
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,640
If you say so

359
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,670
My father was the one who personally sent the Lord to that position.

360
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,150
I intend to eliminate him before the master reveals his true colors.

361
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,920
Put the blame on the guards who forged their identities

362
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,020
This ends the matter

363
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,460
You probably wanted something the last time you came to see me.

364
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,890
What do you want?

365
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,270
I want exactly

366
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,790
Lord

367
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,890
I can't stop

368
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,130
Zhaorong, if this is your intention

369
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,260
Even worse

370
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm here to tell you what the Queen Mother did yesterday.

371
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,260
The man who saved the ruined party

372
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,260
The Queen Mother

373
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,530
Do you think I would believe this?

374
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,200
Yipin you

375
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,290
You must think that I was the one who hurt the master like that.

376
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,380
This is something we can find out if we dig deeper.

377
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,170
Just like you, sir

378
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,390
Like trying to mess up the party

379
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,810
Because the nave is vacant...

380
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,640
I don't expect location.

381
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,960
only

382
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,160
The central hall can disappear from His Highness' side

383
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,980
Lord, he

384
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,450
There is a central temple in my heart

385
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,490
You've turned pale after not seeing me for a few days.

386
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,880
Are you that worried about the Lord?

387
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,460
that

388
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,390
How long have you been a historian?

389
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,660
It seems like you developed feelings so quickly.

390
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,520
In fact

391
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,560
I failed to fulfill my responsibilities at home

392
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,690
Records the financial matters that are unfavorable to the family

393
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,870
But lost that

394
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,390
What did you say

395
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,250
I have found the whereabouts of the account book

396
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,020
Now we just need to find that ledger and destroy it.

397
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,590
but

398
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,830
Please save the Queen Mother

399
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,500
Why did you suddenly mention the middle temple?

400
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,790
Holding an account book

401
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,670
That is the Lord

402
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,630
The Queen Mother has nothing to do with this matter

403
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,340
It was the Lord who deceived the Queen

404
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,760
Has everyone been deceived by the Lord?

405
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,230
Whatever the punishment, I am willing to bear it.

406
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,100
but

407
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,820
We are Zhaorong

408
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,300
Our Queen

409
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,430
Please save her please

410
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,950
Father

411
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,700
Have you been staying in the Yijinfu?

412
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,470
yes

413
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,130
Because itâ€™s a big event.

414
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,300
So it's a lot of work

415
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,780
All the details of this incident point to me.

416
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,470
You don't have anything to say about this?

417
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,430
Don't worry

418
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,780
It has been handed over to the Imperial Guard for investigation.

419
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,490
If you are falsely accused

420
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,240
I will reveal the truth myself

421
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,260
It's really reliable.

422
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,050
before

423
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,450
You said you found the size of the dream you wanted, right?

424
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,220
So how big is the dream?

425
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,860
My dream is just

426
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,060
I hope I can be half as good as my father.

427
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,550
Too late

428
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,890
You go take a rest

429
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,900
Don't come over

430
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,260
If you follow me I will kill you

431
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,680
Zhao Rong

432
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,060
What I know

433
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,710
What is it that keeps you moving forward?

434
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,270
Where has the central temple been since morning?

435
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,950
She is in the imperial kitchen

436
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,540
Go ahead

437
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,630
never mind

438
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,300
As soon as I woke up, I wanted to talk to her.

439
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,520
I'm already obsessed with my mother-in-law's household affairs.

440
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,050
Scare me

441
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,950
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

442
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,710
I've been too depressed lately and can't sleep.

443
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,460
So with the attitude of praying in the early morning

444
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,270
Doing one

445
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,770
A very annoying dish that needs to be polished 500 times

446
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,340
This fuzzy color is weird.

447
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,110
This is not porridge, it's carrot soup

448
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,050
What are you teaching so early in the morning?

449
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,230
It means carrot porridge.

450
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,390
Wait wait wait

451
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,870
How it is done

452
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,810
Dice onions and carrots

453
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,900
Boil with water for one hour

454
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,860
Then keep stirring these

455
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,370
It's like mixing all the thoughts together.

456
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,780
In order to prevent the porridge from sticking to the bottom, keep stirring

457
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,160
With a pious heart

458
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,870
On top of this

459
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,980
Add a little salt and starch water

460
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,410
And starch water

461
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,690
Is this the end?

462
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,020
no

463
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,930
You need to boil various vegetables in advance to make the soup

464
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,600
Add a little bit

465
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,820
The taste will become richer

466
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,220
I'm putting so much effort into just letting it go a little bit.

467
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,120
Didn't I say that?

468
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,380
It's like praying in the early morning

469
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,990
With such great sincerity

470
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,890
Ate this

471
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,980
His Highness will be moved and stand up immediately.

472
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,750
No

473
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,950
Both sides are in-laws

474
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,110
It's a one-time thing.

475
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,670
Just because of what I said last time

476
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,450
Have you been serving breakfast to your mother-in-law since early in the morning?

477
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,130
How dare you say I'm old?

478
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,190
As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw her

479
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,060
What's this

480
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,940
This is called brunch

481
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,720
Brun

482
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,120
Women's women

483
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,620
It's women dining together.

484
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,850
Meaning that can contribute to peace

485
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,780
Who doesn't know about brunch?

486
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,700
Not some country boy.

487
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,840
This woman

488
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,910
It is something that girls often taste.

489
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,520
It's very nostalgic.

490
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,600
This woman

491
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,420
This is porridge made from carrots

492
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,450
Contains many ingredients that can brighten eyes

493
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,330
Yeah

494
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,720
Please eat more, Queen.

495
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,140
I feel like I can't see anything in my eyes lately.

496
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,280
So

497
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,230
I feel like the middle hall is going to eat it all.

498
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,070
What what what

499
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,050
Why is it so scary?

500
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,820
It tastes good.

501
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,700
Still edible

502
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,370
I will create more occasions like this in the future.

503
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:06,980
This woman

504
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,100
This woman

505
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,340
Then I'll go prepare some cold drinks.

506
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,130
Goodbye first

507
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,550
Rumors about the Middle Temple's craftsmanship

508
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,710
It's still an exaggeration.

509
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,090
Being able to appreciate good food is also a kind of character.

510
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,570
Because of this thing

511
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,880
And take special care of the nave?

512
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,990
This sentence about the Queen Mother actually came from the Queen Mother's mouth

513
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,240
It's hard to believe.

514
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,830
really

515
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,740
I can't believe what I said.

516
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,850
But the Lord and the Queen avoid others every night.

517
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,320
So I often send letters.

518
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,470
after all

519
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,020
What is he talking about?

520
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,680
Serve a cold drink

521
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,480
This is wine and various fruits.

522
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,790
A cold drink made with Qingyang cinnamon bark and other ingredients

523
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,220
Have you been drinking since morning?

524
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,970
The alcohol content is evaporated

525
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,890
Only the ingredients that can keep people young are left

526
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,010
This can't be called a cold drink.

527
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,900
Should I call it a tonic?

528
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,070
Heating the wine

529
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,570
How could you think of doing this?

530
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:45,000
Where did the cuisine of the Nakaden come from?

531
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,220
Should I say it is some kind of inspiration or creation?

532
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,540
When you see the ingredients

533
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,870
I will naturally think of

534
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,110
Cooking methods that can preserve the original flavor of ingredients to the greatest extent

535
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,790
Because they are very wary of the West.

536
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,630
Of course it can't be called French.

537
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,670
Wife

538
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,300
Hello, Master

539
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,260
I have something to tell you

540
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,630
Been waiting for you

541
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,450
What

542
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,490
What is it?

543
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,000
After seeing the accident of His Majesty

544
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,560
I have mixed feelings.

545
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,070
Life is unpredictable

546
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,600
No one knows what will happen tomorrow

547
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,160
If my life ended tomorrow

548
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,560
What will I end up with?

549
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,050
That is my heart that hesitated and didn't express itself

550
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,560
A sincere heart is more important than a gorgeous confession

551
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,690
So I like Miss Hong Yan

552
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,800
I don't like

553
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,340
What

554
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,700
That saltpeter

555
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,810
The amount produced by factories in the southern part of Gyeongsang Province

556
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,840
There is always a discrepancy between the amount reported to the Gunpowder Production Office.

557
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,390
really

558
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,020
Is the master still not well?

559
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,250
Yes

560
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,430
I heard I lost my hearing.

561
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,340
I'm still worried even when I wake up.

562
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,180
The accident that happened to the Lord

563
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,890
If it exploded at that level, would it be saltpeter?

564
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:55,180
Maybe sulfur or explosive gas.

565
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,500
If it is sulfur

566
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,360
The smell is so strong, Your Highness must have noticed it.

567
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,690
If it is gas

568
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,370
It's not easy to explode without showing any sign of it.

569
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:08,590
Even tortured prisoners would not tell the truth

570
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,780
Just see the material

571
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,490
The best cooking method will come naturally

572
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,100
Could it be

573
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,030
Did the traitor reveal the person behind it?

574
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,080
He should be a junior adviser who is dissatisfied with the current court.

575
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,930
We got together and did this

576
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,150
Is this what no one behind the scenes meant?

577
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:09,850
Such a big thing as regicide won't happen like this.

578
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,490
It turns out that barefoot people are not afraid of wearing shoes

579
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,710
I can't live like a normal person anyway.

580
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,650
Let's do a big one.

581
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,660
Isn't that the mentality?

582
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,220
He is also the half brother who recommended His Majesty the Lord.

583
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,560
Li Yuanqing's rebellion was also committed by lower-ranking warriors

584
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,710
Your Highness, the longer you lie there, the more confused you become.

585
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:44,330
So the seven criminals will be executed today.

586
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,840
For treason that threatens His Highness' life

587
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,970
Behead you

588
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,470
Any final words?

589
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,990
If we behead them now

590
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,390
You will never find the person behind it.

591
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,190
Didn't you say there's no one behind it?

592
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,330
That's a hasty conclusion.

593
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,980
This was a thorough investigation last night.

594
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,750
Conclusion

595
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,810
cut

596
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,710
Stop

597
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,640
This is an interrogation conducted by imperial decree.

598
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,970
Are you trying to get in the way?

599
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,430
Release the innocent people now.

600
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,070
This is the true decree.

601
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm late

602
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:56,660
Lord

603
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,350
Not in bed

604
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,190
Because he was a young man with a lot of blood, he woke up like this

605
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,710
I think it's a waste of time to recuperate in bed.

606
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,920
I investigated the forces that wanted to kill me and rebel.

607
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,100
So I investigated the minister first.

608
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,730
Does that mean we are under surveillance?

609
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,240
Someone attempted a rebellion

610
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,540
Now, compared to my life

611
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,550
Is this what you mean? The minister's private life is more important.

612
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,730
No, that's not it.

613
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,580
If you don't want to hide

614
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,300
There's nothing to be afraid of.

615
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:57,760
Don't worry, we found the person behind it.

616
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,510
Incense used in rituals of offering sacrifices to the heavens

617
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,690
There is a large amount of domestic saltpeter

618
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,710
How come?

619
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,380
What's going on?

620
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,630
The incense burner will become a giant cannonball

621
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,210
Too dangerous

622
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,850
This is more certain

623
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,060
Found when investigating the source of saltpeter

624
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,940
Information about the secret trade of saltpeter in the village port

625
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,230
But where should so much saltpeter be used?

626
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,190
To be used when we fight North Korea again

627
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,150
Thank you. Thank you.

628
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,030
Thanks

629
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,760
Thanks

630
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,820
Thank you. Thank you.

631
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,230
Thanks

632
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,230
Where did the saltpeter come from?

633
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,230
Saltpeter is made for military use

634
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,110
It cannot be manufactured or used privately.

635
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,670
Something dangerous and precious

636
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,230
So we investigated all the saltpeter factories in North Korea.

637
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,790
Found something strange

638
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,850
There are saltpeter factories in specific places

639
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,150
Transferring a certain amount of saltpeter

640
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,530
At the beginning, it was a small amount of saltpeter and ink.

641
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:46,290
Gradually increasing like the black greed is growing

642
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,280
Knowing this kind of saltpeter corruption

643
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,420
When did it start?

644
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,610
Kim Jakeun Training General

645
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,360
It was the year I ascended the throne, the first year of Qi

646
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:10,060
This is also the year when Master Jin Zuogen became a training general.

647
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,840
Your Highness is slandering

648
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,190
Shut up

649
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,800
The person in charge of the saltpeter factory, Bingpan, was also

650
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,430
The rebel who conspired with Kim Jakeun

651
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,130
I will use the fake identity of the guard as bait

652
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,430
Because Kim Jageun must know

653
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,300
Fake identity

654
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,930
Will definitely suffer unbearable torture

655
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,310
But hold on, I will save you.

656
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:53,290
Please investigate my grievances, Your Highness.

657
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,640
If you seek justice in front of me again

658
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,420
I will give you poison immediately

659
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:12,120
Saltpeter merchants will sell to anyone as long as they are paid.

660
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,760
Selling thieves and even Japanese

661
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,470
If this isn't to destroy North Korea, then what is this?

662
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,140
Who else is here with them?

663
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,160
Training General Kim Jakeun

664
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,210
Kim Chang-hyup, Minister of Military Affairs

665
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,820
You two sinners

666
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,150
Stealing the country's weapons weakens the military

667
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,340
Want to kill me as the king

668
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:54,070
A traitor who was planning a rebellion

669
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,010
What is the name of this operation going to be?

670
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,850
Suzaku

671
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,370
The name of this operation

672
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,590
It is the burning Suzaku

673
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,510
I will hold all crimes to account

674
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:22,070
The two criminals were dismissed and sent back home.

675
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,140
The King and the Concubine

676
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,580
What are you doing?

677
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,790
Why are you so impulsive?

678
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,010
I lost my judgment after the accident.

679
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,960
Please obey your duty, Lord.

680
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,050
Yeah

681
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,550
If you say this

682
00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:00,450
You are the one who has lost your judgement.

683
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,590
I can no longer entrust the running of the court to you.

684
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,980
I request to remove the censorship

685
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,230
Now is the time for me to make my own decisions on state affairs.

686
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,620
Lord

687
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,520
I wanted to poison the criminal Jin Zuogen and exterminate his entire clan immediately.

688
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,270
But for the sake of the Queen Mother and the Queen Mother

689
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,390
Only then did he generously end it by dismissing him from office.

690
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,080
Wouldn't you like to?

691
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:40,790
Are you trying to trade my brother's life now?

692
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,730
Trading is something that can be discussed when a choice is made

693
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,400
Your Highness

694
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,220
Although I, the humble minister, feel wronged by the false accusation,

695
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,130
But I will show my loyalty by following your orders

696
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,990
That's a blessing.

697
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,880
I was worried you'd get angry.

698
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,810
I have no obsession with official positions.

699
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,080
But for an honorable departure

700
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,910
Please give me a chance to defend myself.

701
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,510
I request an impeachment hearing at the Constitutional Court.

702
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,050
knew

703
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:22,010
But if the Censorate does not impeach by tomorrow

704
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,390
I will use my power as a king

705
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,020
Immediately dismiss General Kim Jageun from his post

706
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,160
It is not just the Censorate that has avoided this argument.

707
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,610
I will dismiss all the ministers present here.

708
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,940
I am terrified. I am terrified.

709
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,290
You lost, brother.

710
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,670
He was kicked out by the master I personally sent him to.

711
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,310
I didn't expect the Lord would personally plan the assassination.

712
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,810
Who do you think set up the ambush?

713
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,740
I have always trusted you and entrusted the concubine to you.

714
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,930
How could you not look at people?

715
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:19,730
Confucius also said that human hearts are unpredictable.

716
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,660
It is harder to see through the mind than to ascend to heaven

717
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,500
The relationship between the outer and inner wives

718
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,820
There were some mistakes in talent recruitment.

719
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,830
The Queen Dowager also trusts the Queen Consort

720
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,150
And conferred the harem upon her

721
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,390
But he did something that increased the power of his master.

722
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:40,320
And it was the middle temple who saved the party that caused me trouble.

723
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,360
Even scarier is the enemy within

724
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,830
Niangniang

725
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,990
Your Highness is awake, right?

726
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:15,010
You can only give instructions when the person is awake.

727
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,760
If I can't wake up like this

728
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,910
I become useless.

729
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,800
If I become useless

730
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,170
will be abolished

731
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:22,890
If it is abolished

732
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,110
Who cares about revenge or not?

733
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,610
To support myself, of course.

734
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,300
Open a soup restaurant and become a successful boss

735
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,420
It's pretty good.

736
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:31,790
Niangniang

737
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,380
His Highness

738
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,550
His Highness, that's him, right?

739
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,200
Said he woke up

740
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,660
Really

741
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,320
Yes, my spirit has returned to normal.

742
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,480
I just went to the morning court.

743
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,590
I was scared to death

744
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,730
Not this time

745
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,890
MILF

746
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,300
I'm dying of anxiety

747
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,750
MILF

748
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,250
Great! It's really great!

749
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,880
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

750
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,670
It's so nice

751
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,320
I will do it myself

752
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,730
yes

753
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,950
Your Highness

754
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,870
That's OK now.

755
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,680
Just wake up safe and sound.

756
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,390
I won't lose you again

757
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,510
Concubines

758
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,390
Didn't the Queen say she wanted to see His Highness?

759
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,430
How can this happen here?

760
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,110
I'll have another drink

761
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,040
Because it's too awkward for me to meet him sober

762
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,450
Don't drink anymore

763
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,900
You can't do this, my lady.

764
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,410
You get off work, go home

765
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,370
I'm gonna drink it all.

766
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,860
Choi Sang-Gong Choi Sang-Gong

767
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,960
There is plenty of wine in the imperial kitchen.

768
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,970
What makes you so embarrassed?

769
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,490
What's so embarrassing?

770
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,250
That is to say

771
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,960
Why should I be embarrassed?

772
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,230
I'm pretty confident.

773
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,370
Let's go to His Highness.

774
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,670
You can't do this. Wait until you sober up before going.

775
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,900
Okay, let's go tomorrow.

776
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,320
Put off until tomorrow what you don't want to do.

777
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:11,740
Losing weight starts tomorrow

778
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,920
We have tomorrow

779
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,540
Feed me another bottle

780
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,990
Do you think this is a pub?

781
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,540
hurry up

782
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,940
Yeonsangung Palace

783
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:07,850
Niangniang

784
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,340
Niangniang

785
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,050
Found in the Dazao Temple

786
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,310
As expected, the Lord and the Queen are in cahoots.

787
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,300
The nave is completely out of order.

788
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,960
Re-purchase broken items

789
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,840
But the things I used

790
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,460
To use it up to the end

791
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,830
Just use it as firewood

792
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,340
Are we really going to use arsenic this time?

793
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,470
The nave loves food so much

794
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,520
I'll just give her the expensive food.

795
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,350
Are you going to leave the master alone?

796
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:21,580
If you want to use the master there, you have to destroy him.

797
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,550
If she had an accident just after I fell in love with her

798
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,570
He must be very sad.

799
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,020
As long as you become a team with yourself

800
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,900
It will become unfortunate

801
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,680
Tomorrow always comes for us

802
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,300
What a miracle it is.

803
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,150
Let's go to round two.

804
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:36,010
We need to have a celebration party for our Lord.

805
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,900
Please keep your voice down, ma'am.

806
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,390
Lord

807
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,740
Lord

808
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,390
Can't yell like that

809
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,500
Open the door

810
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,470
Open the door

811
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:03,470
(Dragon Beard Potato)

812
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:11,350
(Did the dragon beard potato sleep?)

813
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,610
I accidentally fell asleep

814
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:42,250
Have you been staring at me like this?

815
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,930
How do you keep doing it?

816
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:52,080
Worried about me, trying to understand me

817
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,030
It seems so

818
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,940
You were also the first person I saw when I got here.

819
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,630
I thank you for so many things

820
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,240
When I leave here

821
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,110
You always appear before my eyes

822
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,680
Because I'll never see you again.

823
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,140
Hong Yan

824
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,860
You woke up

825
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,520
(This drama is purely fictional, and the characters, groups, events, etc. that appear have nothing to do with history)

826
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:31,880
(Preview of the next episode)

827
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,160
This woman's soul must have taken over my body

828
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,290
Why are you avoiding me like this?

829
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,240
What exactly do you want to ask?

830
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,030
Do you like it?

831
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,140
Did I say it was forbidden?

832
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,640
Hold me like this and smile and lie down beside me

833
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,130
I told you it's forbidden.

834
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,230
I forbid the things you forbid

835
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,870
Things are ready

836
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,820
What did you see?

837
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,280
Someone will die in the palace today.

838
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,830
They actually want to get rid of the central temple

839
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:13,340
Today I specially prepared ice cubes that are more precious than gold

840
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,090
daughter daughter

841
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,040
Palace
