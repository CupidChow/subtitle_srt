1
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:08,465
(The characters in this play are purely fictional
Group events, etc. have nothing to do with history)

2
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:13,125
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:26,698
No matter how terrible the beast is

4
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,696
I won't bite the person who gives me food.

5
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:29,856
Instead, it wags its tail

6
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:33,138
Since I first held a kitchen knife at the age of thirteen

7
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:36,098
My dream is to move into the Blue House.

8
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,578
I want to be the most powerful person

9
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:39,483
Cook

10
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:41,908
This is why I became a chef.

11
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:43,886
As you just said

12
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:47,213
You are the youngest chef in Cheong Wa Dae

13
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:48,112
initial

14
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:49,138
What

15
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:56,209
Give

16
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,987
Bighead carp

17
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:03,558
That's it.

18
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,421
That that

19
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:08,061
The ambassador is particularly sensitive to fish bones.

20
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:09,615
Please pay special attention

21
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,963
The ambassador is particularly sensitive to fish bones.

22
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,128
Please pay special attention

23
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,058
Really

24
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,449
Well, dare you tell me this again?

25
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,938
Be careful or you will become a chopped fish head

26
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,660
This is something the chef also pays attention to on a daily basis.

27
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,041
You don't have to worry

28
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,946
Does he think he is Qin Shi Huang?

29
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:32,318
Qin Shi Huang

30
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:36,428
The development of fish balls was due to Qin Shi Huang

31
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,720
Qin Shi Huang likes to bully people by taking advantage of his power.

32
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:41,053
He loves fish and eats it every day.

33
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,478
But once you eat a thorn

34
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:45,322
The chef's head will be mercilessly given to...

35
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:48,748
So the chefs in the palace were often replaced.

36
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,173
One day the new chef thought

37
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:53,123
Looks like I'm going to die too.

38
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:55,543
So he gave up on himself

39
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,889
I just put the fish on the knife board and started beating it.

40
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:00,708
I see

41
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:04,158
Well, he's lucky.

42
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,653
Although we don’t think we’d kill someone for a dish

43
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,482
But it’s not just a dish.

44
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,423
Excellent cuisine

45
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,704
It can move the heart of the iron wall

46
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:20,368
It can be said that it is the most attractive bullet in the world.

47
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:25,163
So when cooking at Cheong Wa Dae

48
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,188
I always think like this

49
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,488
Cooking is politics

50
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:30,853
You also mentioned

51
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,898
Now let’s talk about something that everyone is curious about.

52
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,353
Let’s get down to business

53
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,828
For example, the behind-the-scenes footage of the Blue House

54
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,385
Well, before that

55
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,283
Let's talk about one thing first

56
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,188
My name cannot be published

57
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,198
Hard work fee should be paid in cash

58
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:46,982
OK

59
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:54,986
That?

60
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:57,506
It's been broken for a week because of a short circuit.

61
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,192
It was broken by itself.

62
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,437
Or you broke it?

63
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,596
Sometimes people need to turn a blind eye

64
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,240
Thanks to

65
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:10,655
I can also enjoy some blessings

66
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,473
But can we really be so leisurely?

67
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:15,838
The main dishes are out.

68
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:16,965
The game is over

69
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:18,268
Now the Chinese ambassador estimates

70
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,329
They are all tasting the taste of heaven

71
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:47,483
quick

72
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,809
Go find him

73
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,618
Chef Zhang

74
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,643
Where are you

75
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,698
Really

76
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,340
Looking for me too much is also very tiring

77
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:02,428
To fall in love with my cooking, the ambassador has to praise me personally

78
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,919
Wait for me Sunyoung

79
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,259
I am Hai Jing

80
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,349
Sunyoung is a more suitable name for you.

81
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,145
(Episode 1: Strange Country's Jang Bong-hwan)

82
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,235
(Be careful of dogs that may bite you)

83
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:41,346
I was scared to death

84
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,372
Hello

85
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,518
You come

86
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:47,002
Zhang Fenghuan

87
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,105
We are the police from the Criminal Division of Jongno Police Station.

88
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:52,465
no

89
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,038
That guy Jang Bong-hwan

90
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,188
Why is your last name Zhang?

91
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:57,360
Everyone calls him Chef Zhang
(same as chef)

92
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:00,145
I feel like I lost to him starting from the name.

93
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:02,858
As long as we can cooperate with Hanshi Tianxia in the future

94
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,913
A name to be known all over the world

95
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,793
It's husband Shengmin

96
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,148
Not Zhang Fenghuan

97
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,068
Do it well

98
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,483
Remember to keep it confidential

99
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:11,189
Of course

100
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,347
Don't let yourself get misunderstood.

101
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:16,008
We are such clean people.

102
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:26,577
oops

103
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,202
Oops, you scared us.

104
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,033
Please come with us to the office.

105
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:33,364
No, that matter has been concluded.

106
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,048
I also took responsibility and quit my job.

107
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:35,933
What's wrong?

108
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:36,837
We found you suspected

109
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,085
Fraud in food supply

110
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:40,198
How much fraud

111
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,512
Up to two years

112
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:43,518
I guess it's a lot of money.

113
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,223
So the evidence just happened to point to me?

114
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:48,197
Oh, who said that?

115
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:49,603
Just a reference survey

116
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:51,458
Really bad acting

117
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,229
Can we open the door now?

118
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,698
Even our police officers should know this.

119
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,058
This kind of thing happens in the Blue House

120
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,917
Can it be decided by a chef?

121
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,583
Fu Shengmin that guy

122
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,653
But the person who stayed in the Blue House kitchen the longest

123
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:06,986
He is the defect itself

124
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,627
He must have colluded with someone above him.

125
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:10,538
Then they framed me

126
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,903
Uh-huh, so

127
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:12,869
You have to go to the office with us.

128
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:16,057
Tell us everything you know.

129
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:17,952
I used to think

130
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:19,247
Just to fire me.

131
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,683
Is it worth spending so much energy?

132
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,718
That's how it is.

133
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,868
In this case, he should at least be the chief secretary.

134
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,788
Is it Director Han?

135
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:28,833
Why did you suddenly start talking to yourself?

136
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,008
It's so urgent now

137
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:31,028
Why could that be?

138
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:32,261
Of course, it's stalling for time.

139
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:34,089
But we don't have time

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,972
do what

141
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:41,737
Jang Bong-hwan stopped

142
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:47,728
He's also very impatient.

143
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,632
I will hire a lawyer to investigate the situation.

144
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:53,085
Then I'll find you

145
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:54,364
Our police officer

146
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,612
Don't you also need to catch the criminal to get promoted?

147
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,435
OK

148
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:01,728
Did you hear that?

149
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:02,512
OK OK

150
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,498
Go back. It's time to go home.

151
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:06,158
Brat

152
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:18,622
Hello

153
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:22,023
That puppy

154
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,743
That's why I told you to be careful with the dog.

155
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:24,783
Don't come over here

156
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:28,460
Zhang Fenghuan, you will get into trouble if you do that.

157
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,936
Don't move

158
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:36,108
Damn

159
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:38,412
That's right

160
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,286
I have an important question

161
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:41,037
Can I ask?

162
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:42,093
What to ask

163
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,353
Why do people in detention centers always order rice sausage soup?

164
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,813
What the hell are you asking?

165
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:48,408
I really hate rice sausage soup.

166
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,601
Is the police station your home cafeteria?

167
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:52,573
Is this a rest area on the highway?

168
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,767
I want to choose the menu myself

169
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,082
I'm a chef.

170
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,683
In such a crisis situation

171
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,001
A man who only thinks about cooking

172
00:08:59,026 --> 00:08:59,716
Chef Zhang

173
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:01,101
Stop being funny.

174
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,130
Don't let go Don't let go

175
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:11,698
Damn

176
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:13,482
Almost died

177
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,276
It's really beautiful, right?

178
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,483
no

179
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:49,658
I have so many women

180
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,391
I haven't dated before.

181
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,586
Help

182
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,285
I don't want to die

183
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:17,812
I really don't want to die

184
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,276
here

185
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,386
It's heaven

186
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,258
No, I have to live.

187
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,256
But this cloth...

188
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,138
Would you bury me completely?

189
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:27,768
No

190
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,783
But also

191
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,438
How can I go to heaven?

192
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,488
Although I didn't do anything bad

193
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:35,733
But didn't do anything good.

194
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:41,398
But this place with a lot of historical flavor is...

195
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,048
Hanok Village

196
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,523
But I fell from such a high place.

197
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,038
Why is there nothing wrong with my body?

198
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:08,339
Sure enough, men still need to do some lower body exercises

199
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,373
I'm fine, right?

200
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,959
My precious...

201
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,660
Why are there no muscles?

202
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,169
Where have all my beloved muscles gone?

203
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,000
Damn

204
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,788
No wonder they say that if you don't exercise your muscles they will turn into fat

205
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:25,648
How long did I lie there?

206
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,558
What's going on?

207
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,316
Dream

208
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:18,438
I've come back from the dead and I still dream about women

209
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,208
I really am a dog that can't change its eating habits.

210
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:22,308
But shouldn't I dream of making love with a woman?

211
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,157
Why did I dream of becoming a woman?

212
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,158
What's going on?

213
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:27,661
Oh, there is only one word difference between nightmare and wet dream

214
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:31,724
But why does this woman look so familiar?

215
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,677
Did you see it on Instagram?

216
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:36,133
No, we even had close contact.

217
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:37,258
The relationship should be not shallow

218
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:38,758
Soo-yeon

219
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,088
Caiying

220
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,084
Water Ghost

221
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,598
Even the voice has changed

222
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:50,521
Niangniang

223
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,033
My lady, you finally woke up

224
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,151
I knew you would wake up.

225
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,278
Very good

226
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,677
It's really great

227
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,433
Please don't move

228
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:05,443
What happened? What happened?

229
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:07,318
You haven't recovered yet.

230
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:08,843
Small...

231
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,227
That's right

232
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:25,632
If you want to do it, you have to dream like this

233
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,978
How beautiful...

234
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:31,104
What the hell

235
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,148
It's too hard to drink.

236
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,790
Is that posture inconvenient for drinking?

237
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,662
What kind of dream is so real even to the taste?

238
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,028
I'll add more licorice and cook it again for you

239
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:43,968
Could it be

240
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,456
Not dreaming

241
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:49,873
This is the end

242
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:51,958
What's going on?

243
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,869
It's all small mistakes.

244
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,788
I really shouldn't have left you.

245
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,893
I'm really sorry.

246
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,795
From now on, I will never leave you for a moment.

247
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,359
Niangniang

248
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:35,920
Niangniang

249
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:47,952
Niangniang

250
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:49,600
Niangniang

251
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,387
Niangniang

252
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:53,218
Oops Oops Oops

253
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:53,943
oops

254
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,160
Oh my god

255
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:55,965
Niangniang

256
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,736
Niangniang

257
00:15:58,513 --> 00:15:59,043
Niangniang

258
00:15:59,068 --> 00:15:59,838
oops

259
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,402
Really

260
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:03,388
Niangniang

261
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,170
What are they chasing me for? It's scary.

262
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,990
Madam, please don't run so fast.

263
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,955
Where are you going?

264
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,127
Niangniang

265
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,598
Madam, where are you going?

266
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,108
It's dangerous for you to run so fast.

267
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:23,853
oops

268
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,958
Oh my god

269
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,908
MILF

270
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,699
Niangniang

271
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,423
Damn

272
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,968
Oh my god, what happened?

273
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:41,503
She is not Hong Gil-dong, how can she run so fast?

274
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:42,363
Niangniang

275
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:43,589
Madam, please stop.

276
00:16:43,614 --> 00:16:45,353
Madam, please stop.

277
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:46,771
Niangniang

278
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:49,538
Where's the palace?

279
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:51,338
strangeness

280
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,442
Everything is weird, sissy.

281
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,958
If this isn't a dream, then what is it?

282
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,333
what is going on

283
00:16:56,358 --> 00:17:00,878
My Lady, My Lady, My Lady...

284
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,338
Niangniang

285
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,418
But what's really strange is

286
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:09,190
They all ran like this.

287
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:10,865
The weird thing is that I didn't feel anything at all.

288
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:14,576
No

289
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,888
How could there not be?

290
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,543
Oh, how can such a thing...

291
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:21,268
mine

292
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,268
Mine

293
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,263
What are you looking for

294
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,723
I'll find the small one for you.

295
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,028
Don't come near me

296
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:32,845
I

297
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:35,968
He's actually a eunuch

298
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,183
Niangniang

299
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,602
It's really bad that you suddenly act like this

300
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:45,040
What on earth did you do to me?

301
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,701
First of all, for the health of the body

302
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,096
Please accept the imperial physician's diagnosis first.

303
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,083
I don't care whether there is an imperial doctor or not.

304
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:54,768
Who dares to appear in front of me?

305
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,173
I made him a eunuch

306
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,636
What's going on?

307
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,463
Unreasonable

308
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,073
Even if it's human trafficking, this is not acceptable.

309
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:06,711
How can you tie up a man and perform sex reassignment surgery?

310
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,485
Who are you guys?

311
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,980
Who has such deep hatred towards me?

312
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:14,463
What

313
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,258
Is it Director Han?

314
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,893
Is that why I had surgery?

315
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,298
Is he the chief secretary?

316
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,985
It can be so lawless

317
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,268
Did you change the gender of a person?

318
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:35,722
But

319
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:38,168
Why are you all dressed like this?

320
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,938
It's like I've traveled through time.

321
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,886
What

322
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,268
What was your birth month?

323
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,677
May 31, 1988 Gemini

324
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,868
Where do you live?

325
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:15,808
32 Sampoong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul

326
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,393
Regent Apartment No. 1305

327
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,877
Your parents' names are...

328
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,490
Father Zhang Qiling Mother Li Xiuzhen

329
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:24,923
One is a Chinese teacher and the other is a history teacher.

330
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,628
I was born in a group of diligent educators

331
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,138
Sudden mutation of mad dog's only child

332
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,588
Do I need to tell you all these things?

333
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:54,668
Can you tickle me?

334
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,488
Is that so?

335
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:04,688
It's not a dream.

336
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,612
The feeling is too vivid

337
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,591
It's just my soul.

338
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,588
Traveled into this woman's body

339
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,913
Dreams can wait until you wake up

340
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,048
You can come in and go out

341
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:19,758
I said

342
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,895
What happened to this woman?

343
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,080
Tell me what you know

344
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,508
This woman?

345
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:25,878
I mean I

346
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:27,668
What happened to me

347
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:30,098
It's all my fault

348
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:31,938
I didn't even know you sneaked out.

349
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:34,660
Please kill me, my lady.

350
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:37,336
Would your death solve my problem?

351
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,452
Kill if you can solve it

352
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,430
But it's not

353
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,673
Okay, okay.

354
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:43,968
Calm down

355
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,658
Don't cry, don't cry

356
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:46,448
very good

357
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:48,968
So when am I

358
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:50,408
Where did one go?

359
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:52,998
That is...

360
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:56,933
Last night, my lady, you said you were too tired

361
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,057
Want to go to bed early

362
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:02,726
I've confirmed that you fell asleep.

363
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,652
All that needs to be done has been done

364
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,048
This late at night

365
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,493
Are we still going to do our own night patrols?

366
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:21,898
They all have two years of experience in the palace.

367
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,308
Is it that amazing?

368
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:25,118
He is the eldest brother of His Majesty.

369
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:27,043
He is still the best friend of His Majesty.

370
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,553
Of course, more decent

371
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,364
As expected, she has become a member of the palace.

372
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:31,796
That's right

373
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,838
Did you hear that?

374
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,638
Is it a woman's or a ghost's thing?

375
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:38,468
Every time you talk to someone in such a low voice

376
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:39,918
It's one of the two

377
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:42,192
It's a ghost story

378
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,578
It turns out that both are

379
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,621
It's the water ghost that appeared in the lake ahead.

380
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:57,557
oops

381
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:04,549
The two of them immediately jumped into the lake to save you.

382
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,894
We have all had our pulse checked and everything is fine.

383
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,897
But I don't know why all day

384
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:12,372
I can't wake up

385
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,305
And you just woke up not long ago, right?

386
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,608
Yes, it's water.

387
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,933
I and this woman both fell into the water.

388
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,718
It is exchanged through water.

389
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:25,088
Let's go

390
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,158
Go over there

391
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,817
I told you not to follow me.

392
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,363
I just

393
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:39,185
I can't remember why I fell into the water.

394
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,234
I just wanted to go there to have a look.

395
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,119
Okay?

396
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,932
Hey, these followers

397
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:47,518
They will definitely stop me from jumping into the lake.

398
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:48,481
Why

399
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,283
Are we heading there?

400
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:53,449
We are all in the palace, why is it so far away?

401
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,832
Already arrived at the empress

402
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:59,826
That's near the stone tablet.

403
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:00,095
(Spring Pond)

404
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:01,958
To surprise attack

405
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:04,748
MILF

406
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,530
Niangniang

407
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:07,908
Niangniang

408
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:10,128
Niangniang

409
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:13,928
You can't be like this, lady.

410
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:17,118
My lady, you can't do this

411
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,511
Niangniang

412
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,608
Danger

413
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,370
go back

414
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:27,963
Back to my own life

415
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:29,388
Back to my precious body

416
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,185
From now on I must do some good deeds occasionally

417
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,997
God, Buddha, Virgin Mary

418
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,883
Niangniang

419
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:45,908
Niangniang

420
00:23:56,742 --> 00:23:58,468
Are you really not injured?

421
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:01,082
How can there be no water in the lake?

422
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,418
Did any drought happen in one day?

423
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,908
To prevent the accident from happening again

424
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,658
Drain all the water, my lady.

425
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,020
Why did you tell me

426
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,382
Sorry, Madam.

427
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,708
Yes, my lady, yes, my lady

428
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:16,803
Oh my god, this sound of my lady

429
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:18,477
I feel like vomiting after listening to this.

430
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:20,808
Why am I a queen?

431
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,863
My wife is in a bad mood now

432
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:27,062
You all call her Miss.

433
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,240
yes

434
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:32,128
Madam, what is that?

435
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:34,591
Although it has passed the selection

436
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,012
But the ceremony has not yet begun.

437
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,265
She is still a queen

438
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:40,793
Selection

439
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:44,268
Then I am

440
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:47,073
You are the one who will become the middle temple

441
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,424
You're saying I am

442
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,725
The one who will become the king's wife?

443
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:55,693
Yes

444
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,541
Oh, I'm going crazy. Really.

445
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:05,204
The little panic lady is not a lady

446
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,169
How can you be so handsome?

447
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,506
Really handsome

448
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,254
The hands look nice too.

449
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:46,208
what to do

450
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,266
Your Highness

451
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,003
An hour has passed.

452
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:23,028
To take care of yourself, just stop reading here today.

453
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:27,759
Shangshan is the king in charge of a country.

454
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:31,278
Is there anything more important than having an heir?

455
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,808
Although I feel very tired and exhausted

456
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,345
But we can't stop moving forward

457
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:48,163
Even if I give in a hundred times and get on a time machine

458
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,478
But how could it be a woman?

459
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,181
Plus she's not just an ordinary woman.

460
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:52,212
But the nave

461
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,916
I'm a non-marriageist.

462
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:56,451
Why should I become the king's wife?

463
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,108
Wait a moment

464
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:01,798
The middle hall means the royal family.

465
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,248
Do you want to go straight to the bathroom?

466
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:05,973
Miss

467
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,355
Call me empress

468
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:12,608
Call any name

469
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:15,758
Good lady, good lady

470
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,248
I'm the queen, right?

471
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,718
Yes, my lady, yes, my lady

472
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:22,443
I mean I'm the best.

473
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:23,766
It always sounds hard to hear.

474
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,582
But it suddenly sounded good.

475
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:27,962
Hello

476
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:30,993
Let's fill this lake now.

477
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:31,908
This is the command

478
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:36,055
There is such a simple method

479
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,216
No, my lady.

480
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,630
What

481
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,720
Oh, did you become obedient after being severely punished?

482
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,831
Spare my life, slave girl deserves death

483
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,013
Spare my life, slave girl deserves death

484
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:03,823
But please spare my life.

485
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,948
What? Why is it so exaggerated?

486
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:12,338
The Crown Princess finally woke up

487
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,948
Just woke up and bullied the palace maids

488
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,290
It seems like she has fully recovered.

489
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,299
Please let her come over.

490
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,464
Good Your Highness

491
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,176
Your Majesty, Your Highness asked you to go to the pavilion.

492
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:40,358
Your Highness, Your Highness Your Highness, Your Highness

493
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:43,778
My Lord?

494
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,028
oops

495
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,592
The boss here

496
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:22,558
It's really full of vitality

497
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,238
Hey, Your Majesty

498
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,528
Why are you like this?

499
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,856
This is not important

500
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,353
How could it not be important?

501
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:38,397
Always dress neatly

502
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:40,327
Keep an upright heart

503
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,509
I see

504
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:42,574
I have an emergency now

505
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:49,299
Scholars must get up when they hear the cock crow and dress neatly

506
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:54,298
Be sincere

507
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:57,928
Yes, you need to develop a mindset.

508
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,253
I'll read these later

509
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:01,867
I'm really anxious

510
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:05,153
I need water now

511
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:05,818
Hello

512
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,518
Bring a glass of water to the lady.

513
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,358
No no

514
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:11,124
I mean

515
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:12,659
Need lake water

516
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:15,393
All the water in those lakes has been pumped out.

517
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,525
Ah, you mean

518
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,362
Fill up the lake right now, right?

519
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,125
Yeah yeah

520
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,220
no

521
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:25,933
Why

522
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,928
This is an order from the Queen Mother herself.

523
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,001
If my lake is filled up

524
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,762
It's disobedience

525
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:34,875
Aren't you the king?

526
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:37,773
How can a king not decide?

527
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:39,007
The matter of filling the lake with water

528
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:44,735
Understand that I was frightened by the accident.

529
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,477
Still worried

530
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:48,962
The Queen Mother's Thoughts

531
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,349
I also think that pumping the water away is the right thing to do.

532
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,441
Why do you think it's right?

533
00:30:57,264 --> 00:30:58,554
Give me a scientific explanation.

534
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,330
No reason

535
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,918
Are you kidding me?

536
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:14,059
Who are you attacking?

537
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,743
I think you are a very good scholar.

538
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,243
Cover your nose in front of others

539
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:20,511
It seems not in accordance with etiquette

540
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:28,913
I'm so lucky to see you're doing well.

541
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,856
I'm worried about you

542
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:32,455
Yeah

543
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,490
I can feel your sincerity

544
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,238
But is your tone like this?

545
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:39,449
After a narrow escape

546
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:41,007
I feel a lot of dissatisfaction with the world

547
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,858
How did you fall into the lake?

548
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,088
At once

549
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:48,888
Lost that part of my memory

550
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,998
Just this part?

551
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,808
That's weird.

552
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,788
Oh, you are reading the Four Histories

553
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,876
Zhou Yi's words are the most powerful

554
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:05,028
I don't like people touching my books.

555
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,414
Oh, I've already touched it.

556
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,283
Just let me take a look

557
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,098
oops

558
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,174
The husband sings and the wife follows, the daughter must follow in death

559
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,218
A woman must obey her husband

560
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:21,728
That's what I said.

561
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:23,138
You said women must die

562
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:26,433
Feeding Yin cannot go against Yang

563
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,333
Since ancient times, wives have been required to obey their husbands.

564
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,581
Is this the Joseon era?

565
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:33,017
Joseon era

566
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,310
Is the king here?

567
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:37,378
I am the king

568
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:41,482
Why

569
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,506
Really

570
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,928
hateful

571
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:51,938
Letting go

572
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:55,838
Hello

573
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:58,348
Hello

574
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,138
What's wrong with you?

575
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:02,528
Seems a bit suspicious

576
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,018
His Majesty the Lord

577
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,008
Now it's time to go to the palace.

578
00:33:11,848 --> 00:33:13,998
Yes, it's here so soon.

579
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,048
A day when a king is in charge of a country

580
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:19,478
It's like flapping its wings.

581
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,526
OK

582
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,548
You seem to be busy, so I'll leave first.

583
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,728
no

584
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:52,033
Shangshan

585
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,598
exist

586
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,261
Feed Shangshan

587
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:22,474
You know I love books.

588
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,805
Old age and limited mobility

589
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,782
Your hand slipped, Your Highness

590
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,689
The price of the book

591
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,564
Three times higher than your monthly allowance

592
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,933
Please give me death

593
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:41,278
How can this be?

594
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:44,241
Even if books are precious

595
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,731
How can it compare to your life?

596
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:50,359
Your Majesty,

597
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:56,338
You care about learning just like me.

598
00:34:56,948 --> 00:35:00,098
I will prepare a new book for you

599
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,228
Because I have a meeting with the emperor, I'm leaving now.

600
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:08,851
Hello

601
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:11,498
Call the sedan chair.

602
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:16,457
Let's sit together.

603
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,032
Wider than I thought

604
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:20,868
No

605
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,790
It's too crowded to sit together

606
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,447
And you go wash it.

607
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:30,681
Let's go

608
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:41,026
What kind of character is that person?

609
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:51,586
Why

610
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:55,076
Niangniang

611
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:57,091
You can't sit like this.

612
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:59,385
Leg pain

613
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,710
Memory loss

614
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:21,216
This is not just memory loss.

615
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,823
On the eve of the sacrifice, the illness worsened.

616
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:28,972
The delusion of a makeshift way to avoid reality

617
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,014
People who are here now

618
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,456
Only the Queen Mother and I

619
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,468
What if those words just now

620
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,722
It reached my ears through others

621
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:08,773
There will never be such a thing

622
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:14,108
We must find a way to heal the nave.

623
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:15,807
yes

624
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,903
A child who doesn't even know his own name

625
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:47,023
How can I take the position of the mother of the nation?

626
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,567
Tell her your name

627
00:37:48,592 --> 00:37:50,868
Can't we just help her regain her memory?

628
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,842
Please don't worry

629
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:55,724
Want to meet in person?

630
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,599
There are so many eyes watching

631
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,659
There is no need to confirm even the family elders

632
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,274
The appearance is incomparable

633
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:04,681
I will try my best to send someone to contact and resolve it.

634
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,362
But what about the central temple?

635
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,773
Why Alone

636
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:11,116
Going out at this late hour?

637
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,916
I wonder if it's someone

638
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,571
Called her by her master's name

639
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,932
If it is a royal decree, it is hard to doubt it.

640
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:23,433
Who is it?

641
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,052
Are you awake?

642
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,002
Really

643
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:45,287
It seems my spell worked.

644
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,166
The effect of the dragon's face

645
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:54,058
Bring it often.

646
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,413
Interesting news

647
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,726
Is this something suitable to be discussed in the world?

648
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:02,002
The one who is destined to be enthroned in the harem

649
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:04,264
Pushed the nave into the lake

650
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,977
The canonization of the harem will be cancelled

651
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,873
Is her name Zhao Huazhen?

652
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:10,508
Yes

653
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:14,923
There's no excuse.

654
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:17,578
Although the already weakened Fengrang Zhao clan

655
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,351
The extinguished fire

656
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,780
Always be vigilant

657
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:25,773
Because of the removal

658
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,218
Opinions on repairing roads of different sizes diverge

659
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,764
We want to know your Majesty's opinion.

660
00:39:32,546 --> 00:39:33,606
My opinion

661
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:37,645
Big...big road

662
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,856
small road...

663
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,052
this

664
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:45,227
What's the big deal?

665
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,465
What about the main road?

666
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,563
It is advocated to remove

667
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:58,093
Huge financial losses are inevitable

668
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:01,817
How about a phased reduction via small roads?

669
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:03,733
My opinion

670
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:05,351
Exactly

671
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:09,642
Next up

672
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,447
The most urgent national marriage issue

673
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,080
Although the ministers don’t know yet

674
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,872
The palace finally woke up

675
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,289
Your Highness

676
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,017
In fact, after waking up, the Queen

677
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:23,387
Rumors of unusual appearance

678
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,427
Rumor spread in the palace

679
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:28,263
Yeah

680
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:31,216
I first heard

681
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,661
After Zhongdian woke up

682
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:35,721
I also met by chance

683
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:38,483
I'm the slowest one

684
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,731
I am the slowest

685
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:42,633
Just a rumor

686
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:46,291
I'm worried that His Majesty will be upset.

687
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:49,178
That’s why the ministers didn’t make any memorials.

688
00:40:49,353 --> 00:40:50,983
It actually has such a deep meaning

689
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:51,878
We just

690
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:55,501
I thought it wasn't a rumor

691
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:01,631
Seeing the central hall is indeed different from usual

692
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:05,866
After the accident, he said he had lost his memory.

693
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:09,231
The degree of memory loss due to the shock

694
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:11,562
Is it in danger?

695
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:12,387
Is it dangerous

696
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,887
The Queen Mother fell into the water

697
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:17,112
Not just an accident

698
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:18,946
What

699
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:20,073
At that moment

700
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:22,443
A palace servant said that when passing by the lake

701
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,848
I saw a strange woman

702
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:39,229
Who is she?

703
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,048
Confirmed the log book

704
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:42,963
Found out at that moment

705
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,325
There was only one woman allowed in and out of the palace.

706
00:41:46,331 --> 00:41:48,371
She is Zhao Dashou's daughter.

707
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:50,291
Zhao Huazhen

708
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,699
How can you say something like this that makes people take the blame?

709
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:57,253
She didn't

710
00:41:57,296 --> 00:42:00,163
The reason for hurting the Queen

711
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:03,402
She is the one chosen by the harem

712
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,749
Because I want the position in the nave

713
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,666
That's why you hurt the Queen, right?

714
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,645
This is the wronged prince.

715
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,521
Zhao Dashou

716
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:17,080
A loyal minister known for his integrity

717
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,761
His daughter too

718
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,673
Virtuous

719
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,238
Fame

720
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,653
This is rebellion

721
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,673
How dare you say such a thing?

722
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:29,078
Why did Zhao Huazhen sneak into the palace?

723
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:31,138
Aren't you here to see the Queen Mother?

724
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:32,948
What are you talking about now?

725
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,638
Will be punished by God

726
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:36,443
Your Highness

727
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,129
Please find clear facts

728
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:42,225
I am terrified

729
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:09,947
This is really

730
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,807
Embarrassing

731
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:14,775
Zhao Huazhen

732
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:17,448
Be with me that night

733
00:43:17,473 --> 00:43:18,593
All night

734
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:23,568
What

735
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:24,922
certainly

736
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,416
This is before the ceremony.

737
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:28,023
She hasn't been allowed into the harem yet.

738
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,579
But because of my youth and vigor

739
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:32,718
but

740
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:34,968
Don't you all know this?

741
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:38,046
It was the ministers who heard the news faster than me.

742
00:43:39,147 --> 00:43:40,487
Now that things have come to this

743
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:41,868
Complete the national wedding quickly

744
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:43,972
Let her enter the harem immediately

745
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:44,647
how

746
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:46,168
that

747
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,478
The course of the case

748
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,993
As long as the nave regains his memory

749
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:50,467
Everything can be solved

750
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:52,953
Don't jump to conclusions too quickly

751
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:54,442
The court is so divided

752
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,538
Biting each other

753
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:57,623
What can be accomplished?

754
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:05,511
Right?

755
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:11,294
If the ceremony is held like this

756
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,809
It will be the Jin family's world.

757
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,833
The Lord loves Zhao Huazhen so much

758
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,698
There should be a chance to redeem myself.

759
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:20,062
after

760
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:22,385
The fate of our Pungyang Zhao clan

761
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,618
It depends on Zhao Huazhen.

762
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:27,098
first

763
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:29,552
Settle down in the harem without any trouble

764
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:32,404
Gather more talents.

765
00:44:32,563 --> 00:44:35,543
The national wedding can be successfully concluded

766
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:36,804
Why

767
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,594
His face is so dark

768
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:42,753
There's going to be a tough fight soon, isn't there?

769
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,789
Because of my shortcomings

770
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:03,723
The Queen Mother has to work hard every time.

771
00:45:03,943 --> 00:45:05,133
I am terrified

772
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:06,557
What's the hard work?

773
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,165
The Lord's ability to govern the court is also gradually increasing.

774
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:15,313
You're flattered.

775
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:17,368
Just relying on the Queen Mother

776
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,443
Just moving forward reluctantly

777
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,790
Back to the point

778
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:24,187
I didn't notice your youthfulness.

779
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,903
I am terrified

780
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:28,493
I'm scared

781
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:30,611
I couldn't prepare for you in advance

782
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:32,015
but

783
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:35,883
A balanced attitude towards women is also important

784
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:38,923
After all, palace maids are also one of the core of the court.

785
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:40,835
Don't forget

786
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,198
The nave is more important than the harem

787
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:46,927
I will remember

788
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:48,018
besides

789
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,789
Who is the woman the palace servant said she saw?

790
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,008
Must find out

791
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:56,833
We can't let the Central Palace fall into danger again.

792
00:45:58,698 --> 00:45:59,398
yes

793
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,245
you're right

794
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,455
Sorry Miss

795
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:35,354
what to do

796
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,179
It's written so well.

797
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,298
This poem

798
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:57,707
I wrote it with you.

799
00:46:58,185 --> 00:46:59,835
Thanks to you, I became more beautiful

800
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,808
Miss, you are really

801
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:05,513
Miss

802
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:06,585
Miyasato

803
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:08,604
Come to the throne

804
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:16,072
Obey the command of His Majesty

805
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:23,054
Zhao Dashou's daughter Zhao Huazhen

806
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,819
Tomorrow, after the ceremony of His Majesty the Lord

807
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,368
Will be immediately canonized by the harem

808
00:47:27,592 --> 00:47:28,922
Come to the palace as soon as possible.

809
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,640
Really cool

810
00:47:40,914 --> 00:47:42,234
Add some cold water

811
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:47,205
Add water

812
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:50,668
Keep adding, keep adding, keep adding

813
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,379
Yes, water

814
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,469
Here's the Problem

815
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:57,976
Fall into other water

816
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,311
Can I go back?

817
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,827
I fell into the water anyway.

818
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:04,489
Are there no other lakes nearby?

819
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:07,191
There are two more places in the palace alone.

820
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:08,744
Yeah

821
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,159
Yes

822
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:13,047
Although the other lakes are the same now

823
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:14,827
What does this mean?

824
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:18,309
The Queen Mother gave the order

825
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:19,904
The lake in the palace

826
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:21,328
Clean it all up

827
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:22,873
Lake

828
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:23,996
All?

829
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:25,211
It's the queen

830
00:48:26,014 --> 00:48:27,054
Till what time

831
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:28,803
forever

832
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,776
Niangniang

833
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:32,688
So what this means is

834
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:34,813
I

835
00:48:35,439 --> 00:48:37,059
Do you want to live like this?

836
00:48:38,664 --> 00:48:39,564
Forever?

837
00:48:43,238 --> 00:48:44,478
Niangniang

838
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:50,863
water

839
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,290
I'll try whatever water it is.

840
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:56,647
I want to go back

841
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,907
Niangniang

842
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:00,682
Niangniang

843
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:04,066
Niangniang

844
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:05,321
This is dirty water.

845
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:06,306
Niangniang

846
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,846
Niangniang

847
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:11,358
Can't

848
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:17,458
Niangniang

849
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,100
I can't move

850
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,735
Lower your butt

851
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,161
Niangniang

852
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:28,096
Please take out your head.

853
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,401
Can't

854
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:36,278
If it's not that lake water, it won't work.

855
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:47,228
How big will the impact be?

856
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:49,817
As soon as I see water, I always mutate

857
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,647
What's your name, our lovely one?

858
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:07,339
My name is Honglian

859
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:08,358
red lotus

860
00:50:08,518 --> 00:50:10,260
If even from birth

861
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:12,998
I forgot about serving the queen.

862
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:13,943
in the end

863
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,149
How serious is the illness?

864
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:24,468
Why are you crying? It makes me sad.

865
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:28,469
I'm here to present the Korean medicine.

866
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,906
How can I let people see my tears?

867
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,161
The one who is suffering the most now is my aunt.

868
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:40,551
Fear

869
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,070
Yeah, I feel the worst.

870
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,111
This sense of loss

871
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:48,813
You two won't understand.

872
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:55,881
You go out first

873
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,176
Anyway, there is no chance of going back as soon as possible.

874
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,722
If you want to stay here,

875
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,019
Need intelligence

876
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:10,631
but

877
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:12,136
The one I just met

878
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:13,661
What do you call someone with a trashy expression?

879
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,234
I asked you what is the king's name?

880
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:20,335
How dare I use the name of the supreme king

881
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:21,633
That's right

882
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:24,139
You can't call or use the king's name, right?

883
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:26,404
Now is the Joseon era

884
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:27,689
When exactly?

885
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,168
The 29th year of Daoguang reign of Joseon

886
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:33,086
The second year after the king ascended the throne

887
00:51:33,643 --> 00:51:35,023
Daoguang Palace

888
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:36,018
Daoguang

889
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:37,589
I've clearly heard of it.

890
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:39,841
Please give me some more hints.

891
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:42,435
carry

892
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,280
Show?

893
00:51:44,629 --> 00:51:47,899
Then I sing a song

894
00:51:47,924 --> 00:51:49,994
If the king's name is revealed, give me a signal.

895
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:50,826
Listen carefully

896
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:55,818
Taizong Taishi Wenruishi

897
00:51:55,843 --> 00:51:58,338
Yeoseongjunjungrenmyeongsun

898
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,099
Not yet?

899
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:03,419
It seems to be still far behind.

900
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:06,606
Kwang In Hyeon Yeon Suk Kyung Yeong

901
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:08,231
Zhengchun Xianzhegao

902
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:09,890
high

903
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,896
Gao Zhexianchun

904
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:20,444
Junxian

905
00:52:22,983 --> 00:52:24,413
Why are there still small flying insects?

906
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:28,458
Words after Xianzong

907
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,584
Cheoljong

908
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,289
Cheoljong's real name was Yi Won-beom

909
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:40,405
After becoming king, he changed his name to Li Heng

910
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:42,706
The whole family was drawn into the struggle

911
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:44,001
Exiled to Ganghwa Island

912
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:45,516
Depressed all day

913
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:47,807
One day I woke up early and became the king's gray girl

914
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:51,147
As the most ignorant and incompetent puppet king

915
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:52,947
Let the people suffer

916
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,277
Died of illness after fourteen years in office

917
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:59,869
It is indeed dangerous to be born into a royal family.

918
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:01,085
Long live my mother

919
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,564
The rich in Silla are scary.

920
00:53:05,938 --> 00:53:08,528
The ruler of Silla was truly extraordinary as a king.

921
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,466
I don't even know the status of the nave.

922
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,751
How heartless!

923
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,368
Let me take a look

924
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:20,204
What to do

925
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,018
There's no need to be shy

926
00:53:25,226 --> 00:53:27,936
Tomorrow we will be husband and wife.

927
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:31,161
Tomorrow?

928
00:53:32,783 --> 00:53:35,483
The ceremony was postponed due to an accident

929
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,298
I asked them to prepare quickly.

930
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:39,698
Tomorrow

931
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:41,587
Our Gift Ceremony

932
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,580
OH MY GOD

933
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:45,633
I forgot the most important thing

934
00:53:45,658 --> 00:53:47,229
Let Cheoljong indulge in women

935
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:48,650
And he was famous for neglecting state affairs.

936
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:50,746
The representative demon queen of the Joseon Dynasty

937
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:56,283
Wait a moment

938
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:00,105
There is one thing you need to know before that.

939
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:11,105
As the Central Palace wishes

940
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,110
I've told everyone not to get close.

941
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:14,621
Is it ok now?

942
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:17,995
that is

943
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,793
This might be a little hard to accept.

944
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,082
I don't know how to explain this.

945
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,890
What's Here

946
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:26,965
What's wrong

947
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:32,215
It's the petals.

948
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,666
Anyway, although you will feel the shock

949
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,291
But try to accept it.

950
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:44,301
I actually

951
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,191
In fact

952
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,571
Is a man

953
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,026
About two hundred years later

954
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:00,901
I am a healthy person in Korea

955
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:03,161
Although I don't know what happened

956
00:55:03,186 --> 00:55:05,066
I thought I was going to die after falling into the water.

957
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:06,381
I opened my eyes and it became like this

958
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,521
Anyway, I

959
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:09,751
It's not what you think.

960
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:11,411
It means that what you see is not all.

961
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,425
I'm sure you think this is nonsense.

962
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,531
But you

963
00:55:17,556 --> 00:55:19,246
You really have to make a good judgement.

964
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:20,711
Even if you want to get married

965
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:21,671
But the first night

966
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,903
This really isn't possible.

967
00:55:24,235 --> 00:55:26,855
Men are really not my type.

968
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:29,121
this

969
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,558
It's more of a problem for you.

970
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:32,257
I am mainly concerned about the issue of legitimacy

971
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:33,265
But for you

972
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,260
This is a fraudulent marriage.

973
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:35,554
It's a crime

974
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,593
I see

975
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:42,431
did you mean

976
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:45,291
Really

977
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:46,459
you

978
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,404
It's different from what I read in history books.

979
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:49,679
Very wise.

980
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,693
Come on over here

981
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:54,318
It's your highness

982
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:55,374
Call the imperial physician immediately.

983
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:57,522
Accurately grasp the princess's status

984
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:58,651
Cure her.

985
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:05,896
Don't worry

986
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,916
I don't care what method I use

987
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:09,721
It will help you get relaxed

988
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:11,185
Don't forget

989
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:13,256
You are not a man

990
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,140
No matter how depressed I am

991
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,995
Made a mess out of imagination

992
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:21,259
I will be your king forever

993
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:26,401
this

994
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,833
It seems that your body is not well yet.

995
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,620
here

996
00:56:30,507 --> 00:56:32,766
Come and serve quickly

997
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:34,695
It's your highness

998
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,096
Don't worry too much

999
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,654
Go back and rest

1000
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,018
It'll be fine

1001
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,981
Everything will be alright.

1002
00:56:43,938 --> 00:56:47,598
It's okay. It's okay.

1003
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:50,526
Books don't lie.

1004
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,530
It may be even more useless than what the history books say.

1005
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:55,099
Have a good rest

1006
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,441
OK Got it

1007
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:01,147
Niangniang

1008
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:03,472
You can't lift up your skirt.

1009
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:06,710
My lady, you can't show the inside.

1010
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:08,841
My lady, please walk slowly.

1011
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:10,296
This can't be done

1012
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:14,943
What is the careful thought?

1013
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:19,396
No, I won't eat.

1014
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:21,511
I prefer Western medicine to Korean medicine.

1015
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:25,501
Your Highness

1016
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:29,338
ah

1017
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:37,786
Really

1018
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,491
So I

1019
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:58,844
Because the evil breath entered the head

1020
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:01,929
Need to use the rhythm of medicine to fill it

1021
00:58:02,175 --> 00:58:03,736
Niangniang

1022
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:05,602
You must find yourself

1023
00:58:05,629 --> 00:58:07,039
You old fashioned

1024
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:08,414
You don't have any ideas?

1025
00:58:08,508 --> 00:58:11,805
Why sit by the fire?

1026
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:24,187
To open the 13 acupoints for the treatment of spiritual direction

1027
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:26,232
Okay, it's up to you.

1028
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,516
It's not my body anyway.

1029
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:43,789
I remembered

1030
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:47,638
Magical, I remember everything.

1031
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:49,574
red lotus

1032
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:51,371
We grew up together since we were in this family.

1033
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:52,694
My very precious slave

1034
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:58,311
here

1035
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,000
What's this person's name?

1036
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:02,451
Who are you

1037
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,771
Cui

1038
00:59:08,151 --> 00:59:08,731
Cui

1039
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:10,164
Choi Sang-Gong

1040
00:59:13,074 --> 00:59:13,734
So

1041
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:16,618
What's my name?

1042
00:59:22,756 --> 00:59:24,446
How do I know your name?

1043
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:25,861
Everyone gather together

1044
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,116
Hurry up and hold the lady down

1045
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,921
If you move it accidentally, something bad will happen.

1046
00:59:29,593 --> 00:59:31,661
Use this big needle to pierce it

1047
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,256
Is it crazy to treat people like this?

1048
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:36,466
My main skill is acupuncture

1049
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:37,671
Unblock blocked acupoints

1050
00:59:37,696 --> 00:59:39,326
It's best to use this

1051
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,690
Put this on the back of your neck

1052
00:59:40,715 --> 00:59:41,545
Stop

1053
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:43,178
Please stop

1054
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,273
If I cheer up,

1055
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,370
From tomorrow on, it will be the middle temple.

1056
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:52,907
The overtreated nave

1057
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:54,867
What will it cost you?

1058
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:01,628
All things are better in excess than in deficiency

1059
01:00:01,822 --> 01:00:04,867
My powerful medical skills only go so far

1060
01:00:07,894 --> 01:00:09,257
I almost

1061
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:10,698
I started to curse.

1062
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:11,756
Already well

1063
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:12,641
Already well

1064
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:17,261
The princess everyone wants to be

1065
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:18,291
I'll be

1066
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,617
She is nominally a princess of a country.

1067
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:21,763
Fill the pond with water

1068
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:23,198
Can't I just do it as I please?

1069
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:46,896
Niangniang

1070
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,601
It's time to wake up

1071
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,882
Your Highness

1072
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:41,680
Do you have to wear all of these?

1073
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:59,735
(Palace dress set)

1074
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:48,293
Close fitting panties, panties with wide crotch

1075
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,048
Slip skirt shirt

1076
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:54,154
Petticoat, long gown, coat skirt

1077
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:55,239
Three-edge jacket

1078
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:57,464
There is also Tang Yi

1079
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,868
Tops are only underwear

1080
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:03,205
The bottom is a layered multi-piece garment.

1081
01:02:03,237 --> 01:02:05,917
This is for the etiquette of thick and thin

1082
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,136
I can't breathe anymore

1083
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:44,703
The tassels and pearls cover the eyes

1084
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:47,861
The bands that fall down from the sides cover the ears

1085
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,321
It means covering your eyes and ears.

1086
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:52,336
Listen to the meaning of God’s Word

1087
01:02:58,093 --> 01:02:59,363
Please straighten your neck

1088
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:00,847
So heavy

1089
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:03,423
Need to bear this weight

1090
01:03:54,555 --> 01:03:57,385
I am the first NO BRA in North Korea

1091
01:04:01,118 --> 01:04:03,678
Greetings

1092
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:09,265
Niangniang

1093
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,495
What do you want?

1094
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:50,152
It's not a sacrifice.

1095
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,598
They say marriage is a funeral.

1096
01:04:57,195 --> 01:04:58,496
Salute again.

1097
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:00,831
Twice more

1098
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:12,765
What a beautiful couple.

1099
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,613
Aren't these all the work of the Queen?

1100
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:20,485
Thank you for your appreciation, Queen.

1101
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:27,796
Gold Cup Ceremony

1102
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:00,294
no

1103
01:06:00,562 --> 01:06:04,127
Are you crying now, my dear elder?

1104
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:10,141
On this day, I became the mother of the nation.

1105
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:12,807
But when the time comes

1106
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:16,376
I still feel like I lost my only daughter.

1107
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:22,397
Now you are not the father-in-law of the emperor.

1108
01:06:22,997 --> 01:06:25,409
Rong En, the father-in-law

1109
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:26,974
Is that so?

1110
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:36,589
Announced here

1111
01:06:36,637 --> 01:06:41,916
Kim So-yong of Andong Jinmen became the mother of the Joseon nation

1112
01:06:42,453 --> 01:06:44,663
Looking at this woman's name

1113
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,596
You must like me

1114
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,530
Shortness of breath, heart palsy

1115
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,041
Back off

1116
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:39,939
Respectfully bow down

1117
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:47,470
There are no permanent enemies in the palace.

1118
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:49,175
There is no eternal army.

1119
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:53,659
You must keep your heart and empty your mind

1120
01:07:53,864 --> 01:07:55,084
Don't worry

1121
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:59,531
I just want to do my best for His Highness.

1122
01:08:05,204 --> 01:08:08,400
Auntie, I'm not going to die.

1123
01:08:08,486 --> 01:08:09,886
Don't miss me too much

1124
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,649
Such a kind lady

1125
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:17,725
How can I persist in that dangerous palace?

1126
01:08:18,638 --> 01:08:21,718
Don't worry, I'll be by your side to take care of you.

1127
01:09:31,102 --> 01:09:33,092
Surrender Surrender Surrender

1128
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:40,618
I thought we would drink in the pavilion

1129
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,235
So you shouldn't say you're going on a tour.

1130
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,497
I should say training.

1131
01:09:43,815 --> 01:09:46,765
Isn't it nice to sweat under the beautiful scenery?

1132
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:47,857
What's good

1133
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:50,566
Or maybe it's because he has a father who is a military minister.

1134
01:09:50,656 --> 01:09:53,360
I am dying every day because of the martial arts training I have no talent for.

1135
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:54,875
What is this?

1136
01:09:55,173 --> 01:09:57,363
If I knew, I would never come.

1137
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,774
Who would think that they had made enemies?

1138
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,940
It's a happy event that my cousin became the mother of the nation

1139
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:06,381
Why are you so angry?

1140
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,930
Great, I'm so excited, so

1141
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:16,239
If you don't like swordplay, just fight.

1142
01:10:17,726 --> 01:10:19,826
I changed my mind and I want to go home

1143
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:25,351
Defeat me before you leave

1144
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:32,427
Hurry up, hurry up, the neck is broken

1145
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:36,071
I really thought I was going to die.

1146
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:39,314
Photographing dress makeup is really nothing

1147
01:10:53,318 --> 01:10:55,788
But it was upgraded at night.

1148
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:57,651
This is the Great Foundry

1149
01:10:58,758 --> 01:11:01,008
As big as the name

1150
01:11:01,377 --> 01:11:04,137
It means to make great contributions

1151
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:06,941
Is it to save the country or something?

1152
01:11:07,605 --> 01:11:11,565
It means to make the prince pregnant

1153
01:11:17,695 --> 01:11:19,665
Oh, and I have a roommate.

1154
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:24,481
This is the biggest crisis in Zhang Fenghuan's 33 years of life

1155
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:47,875
There is always a way to escape.

1156
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:50,222
The wine table has arrived

1157
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:04,531
Oh, wine.

1158
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,806
My ancestors, I want to drink

1159
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,628
I'll pour you a cup

1160
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:40,864
What kind of wine does His Majesty like?

1161
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:45,094
I prefer snacks to wine.

1162
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:47,022
Such days

1163
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:48,807
Don't talk about snacks.

1164
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:52,675
Excessive drinking is harmful to the body

1165
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:57,577
Don't get excited, calm down.

1166
01:12:57,943 --> 01:12:59,286
There is no

1167
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:00,841
A person without alcohol

1168
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:07,045
You can't drink alcohol. You can't drink as much as I can.

1169
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:10,984
It just so happens that the wine here belongs to the queen.

1170
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:14,477
Is this guy wearing a bulletproof vest or something?

1171
01:13:15,019 --> 01:13:16,859
Nothing works.

1172
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,114
Do you want to play a drinking game?

1173
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:22,264
I know a few drinking games.

1174
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:24,075
Yeah

1175
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:28,712
three six nine three six nine three six nine three six nine

1176
01:13:31,723 --> 01:13:33,593
When did the multiplication table first appear?

1177
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,478
Don't you know?

1178
01:13:36,138 --> 01:13:39,276
Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book

1179
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:41,801
Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book Sign-in book

1180
01:13:41,826 --> 01:13:43,219
The word guilt

1181
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:44,960
It's for use at this time.

1182
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,091
Why don't you do it?

1183
01:13:46,344 --> 01:13:49,894
How can I say it's a game? I'm looking forward to it

1184
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:53,508
I know it's not good to call it a sign-in book.

1185
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,507
Harsh guy

1186
01:13:57,227 --> 01:14:00,007
Drinking or singing and dancing, right?

1187
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:07,172
When should the music for the ancestral temple ceremony end?

1188
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,074
See, aren't my shoulders shaking?

1189
01:14:10,099 --> 01:14:13,949
The wine went in...

1190
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:16,113
Keep going in...

1191
01:14:16,138 --> 01:14:17,469
So interesting?

1192
01:14:22,226 --> 01:14:24,806
What? Is the music for the ancestral temple ritual effective?

1193
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,758
So let's start

1194
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,230
No, no, it's not the official start

1195
01:14:54,628 --> 01:14:56,828
I have to use the last resort.

1196
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:23,515
(Preview of the next episode)

1197
01:15:39,384 --> 01:15:42,302
How does it feel to be welcoming your first day as queen?

1198
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:43,021
That's it.

1199
01:15:43,046 --> 01:15:46,446
We are preparing for a struggle for rights and status

1200
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:49,376
The only way we can punish the powerful

1201
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:52,120
It's the documents that prove their corruption.

1202
01:15:52,145 --> 01:15:56,326
It seems that the Queen's condition is indeed abnormal.

1203
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,455
For us, who is more important than

1204
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,990
Who must be more important?

1205
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:02,291
It's a gift

1206
01:16:02,316 --> 01:16:04,264
If there is such a good method, use it now.

1207
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:06,116
What is the final method?

1208
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:06,981
Assassination
