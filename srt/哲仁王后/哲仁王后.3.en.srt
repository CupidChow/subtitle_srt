(This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations, )

2
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,714
(and events are unrelated
to historical events.)

3
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:23,363
How much did she hear?

4
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,215
I will know upon hearing the first thing...

5
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,133
she has to say when her life is in danger.

6
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,054
If she says, "I did not hear anything"...

7
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,584
or "Please let me live", I will kill her...

8
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,474
as that means she heard everything.

9
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,643
You.

10
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,248
If you kill me now, you will
regret it for the rest of your life.

11
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:49,254
This isn't everything.

12
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,294
Move that over a bit.

13
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,234
Hold on.

14
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,304
(Episode 3)

15
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,543
Just know you've hit the lottery today.

16
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,054
Look. Isn't it pretty? This is yours.

17
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,353
Is she trying to stall?

18
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,183
What is this? Aren't you a thief?

19
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,224
Gosh.

20
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,623
Do you even know who I am?

21
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,094
- I... - She will say she is the Queen.

22
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,633
Served in the Special Forces.

23
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:42,773
Come at me.

24
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,474
Do you think all army cooks are the same?

25
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,624
Army cooks for the Special Forces...

26
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,013
can kill a ghost with a kitchen knife.

27
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,653
Come at me. I'm not scared one bit.

28
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:56,635
Come at me. Come on.

29
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,094
How can she say such odd
things with such sincere eyes?

30
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,784
That's amazing.

31
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,534
His face is his weakness.

32
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,914
That's so cool.

33
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,754
Goodness.

34
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,303
Seeing as how His
Majesty is covering his face,

35
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,134
he is hiding his identity.

36
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,373
Who goes there?

37
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,344
I am Kim Byeong In of
Kim Jwa Geun's family.

38
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,613
What brings you here?

39
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,665
Were you robbed?

40
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,253
He did not get far.

41
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,224
Look around in the surrounding area.

42
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:58,094
He was not alone.

43
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,793
Yes, sir. Split up and look.

44
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,873
Are you okay, Sister?

45
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,714
"Sister"?

46
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:26,123
Why is he looking at his sister like that?

47
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,324
So Yong!

48
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,594
She must have been so shocked.

49
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,834
Who dared to do this to her?

50
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,974
Golden... Oh, my.

51
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,784
- My gosh. - What is this commotion?

52
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,765
We are looking for a suspicious person.

53
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,983
My gosh.

54
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,654
What are you doing?

55
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:02,304
They surprised me,
so I said my hand out loud.

56
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,405
This round is over.

57
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,545
Who says it is over?

58
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,345
Do you want to continue
despite knowing my hand?

59
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,933
You made the mistake,
so why must I suffer a loss?

60
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,464
You are so stingy.

61
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,585
Oh, my. That was a lot.

62
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,025
Did you just spit in my face?

63
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,274
I do not know!

64
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,714
Darn it!

65
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,884
- Apprehend him. - "Apprehend him."

66
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,154
Why are you all standing
there and watching?

67
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:32,035
Make sure that Special
Director Hong does not escape...

68
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,874
and close the door and leave right now!

69
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,944
You always act so tough
when you cannot even fight.

70
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,664
I am going to fix that
attitude of his tonight!

71
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,884
- Please protect me. - Next time.

72
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,164
- Next time? - Why are you not leaving?

73
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,834
If you leave like this... Gosh.

74
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,443
Special Director Hong.

75
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:52,443
I will fix that attitude of yours tonight!

76
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,213
That was realistic.

77
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:02,435
Can I not play a joke on you?

78
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,523
Why are you really swinging a sword at me?

79
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,664
Not there! I have not
even gotten married yet.

80
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,393
Let us go.

81
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,234
Gosh. You are so bad at wielding a sword.

82
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,884
Did you get hurt?

83
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,384
I am fine.

84
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,424
I had no idea Kim Byeong
In would be with her.

85
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,394
Do you think they set a trap?

86
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,045
There is no way they would
use the Queen as bait for a trap.

87
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,114
Furthermore, the Queen's reaction...

88
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,804
was so out of the ordinary,
and it is bothering me.

89
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,214
If we act rashly without
knowing the situation,

90
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:57,144
it can result in a bigger problem.

91
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,674
Let us first figure out what is going on.

92
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,213
However,

93
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:03,983
what if the Queen heard everything?

94
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,914
The person who faced the Queen was me.

95
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,754
Please trust my judgment.

96
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,093
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,794
If my judgment is wrong,

98
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,233
bloodshed is bound to occur.

99
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,943
(Episode 3: Sleeping With the Enemy)

100
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,804
A noble person is entering.

101
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:52,268
Regardless of how noble they are,
if they are not the King...

102
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,933
Withdraw your swords. Withdraw them.

103
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:00,803
Let us go.

104
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:10,083
I would like this to remain a secret.

105
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:11,583
Yes, sir.

106
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,593
Oh, my.

107
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,693
She has fainted from shock,

108
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,454
so clean up her bedding and
prepare to nurse her in secret.

109
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:34,604
Yes, sir.

110
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,593
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

111
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,004
It is you again.

112
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,534
You are the only person who
comes to look for me when I am hiding.

113
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,843
Your wedding is tomorrow.
What are you doing here?

114
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:17,683
I thought I was going to go crazy,
so I left the palace,

115
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,683
but there is...

116
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,524
no place for me to go.

117
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:55,713
I will bring you back to the
palace without anyone noticing.

118
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:01,053
A dream I had ever since I was young...

119
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:04,823
will be coming true tomorrow...

120
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,664
as my dream was to become the Queen.

121
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,203
Tomorrow, my dream will come true.

122
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,473
Tomorrow, my dream...

123
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,683
will disappear.

124
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,583
What is wrong?

125
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,494
I am scared.

126
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,093
I am afraid...

127
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,833
I am afraid to live.

128
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,933
- Your Highness. - Do not call me that.

129
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,634
Call me by my name.
Even if it is just for today.

130
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,543
So that I do not forget who I am.

131
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,114
So that I do not...

132
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,043
let go of myself.

133
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,553
What on earth are you so afraid of?

134
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,854
I am not myself.

135
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:09,254
I have lived all this time
thinking I was myself,

136
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:12,164
but that was not true.

137
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,494
There is not a single
thing that is not a lie.

138
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,953
You are So Yong.

139
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,494
You are the woman I
have known for a long time,

140
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,693
secretly loved, and cherished.

141
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,104
I will not let go of you.

142
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,744
I will not forget you.

143
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:58,933
What on earth...

144
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,543
happened that night?

145
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,644
Please kill me now.

146
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,514
I called for a royal physician.
Please wait, Your Highness.

147
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:19,524
That quack.

148
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,674
I already have a headache as it is.

149
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,494
He'd better not show his face around here.

150
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,264
If he does,
I'll make sure he never gets to reproduce.

151
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,203
Then, please have some of your meal. Here.

152
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:42,073
It's making me nauseous. I
think I'm going to throw up.

153
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,125
How much did you drink last night?

154
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,514
This woman has no tolerance for alcohol.

155
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,323
I haven't blacked out like this for ages.

156
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,894
How did I come back last night?

157
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,444
Luckily, your cousin,
Young Master Byeong In brought you in.

158
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,894
You could have been in big trouble.

159
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,844
Thanks to him, I am the only one...

160
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,634
who knows that you went out last night.

161
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,274
My cousin?

162
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:10,303
How did I run into my cousin?

163
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,504
I am not sure about that.

164
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:17,224
By the way, he said that you
fainted because of some shock.

165
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,694
- Why were you so shocked?
- I didn't faint.

166
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:21,414
I passed out because I was wasted.

167
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,235
By the way, it's nice to be the queen.

168
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,005
They opened up the gate
when it was past curfew.

169
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:28,035
He is your cousin,

170
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,174
but he is the adopted
son of Lord Kim Jwa Geun.

171
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,423
Is that so?

172
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:38,314
I don't see Court Lady Choi.

173
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,534
Is she late?

174
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,025
Your cousin sent her out of the palace...

175
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,374
to make sure no one finds
out you got sick from drinking.

176
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,724
But she did not want to leave the palace,

177
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,713
so it was very difficult
to get her to leave.

178
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,154
By the way,
why do people hate leaving the palace?

179
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,683
Well, it is dangerous outside the palace.

180
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,823
And everything one would
need is already in the palace.

181
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,864
Has everyone here been hypnotized?

182
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,263
There's one thing you
can't find at the palace.

183
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,094
- What is it? - Freedom.

184
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,733
Well, it is not much
different outside the palace.

185
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:17,104
Anyway, it's nice that she's
not here. She always nags me.

186
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,743
Oh, my head.

187
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,094
When I'm hungover like this,
I should have some spicy ramyeon...

188
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,483
and sweat it out. That
would be the perfect remedy.

189
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:29,935
There's no ramyeon here.

190
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,084
And neither are hangover drinks.

191
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,164
But I've got power here.

192
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,634
My goodness.

193
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,664
Start the fire.

194
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,614
- Start the fire. - Start the fire.

195
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,733
I have no idea what she wants.

196
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,084
What is it?

197
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,354
So this meal is for Daejojeon Hall.

198
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,473
Okay.

199
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,243
What nonsense is that?

200
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:13,763
Is the boiled meat ready?

201
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,013
This isn't it.

202
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,584
All right, then. This time...

203
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,033
My gosh. Is this the best he can do?

204
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:58,374
What is the problem with my
dishes? What on earth is it?

205
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,094
Gosh. It tastes too healthy.

206
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,673
It's not spicy at all.

207
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,283
It's too spicy. Is he trying to kill me?

208
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:47,354
I quit!

209
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:50,005
If she is unhappy,
she can come down and cook it herself.

210
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,364
How frustrating. I'll cook it myself.

211
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,455
The furnace has strong firepower,

212
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,154
but it's hard to control
the fire precisely.

213
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,304
And the thermal conductivity
of the cauldron is quite high.

214
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,894
What if you hurt yourself, Your Highness?

215
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:13,195
You have never set foot in the kitchen...

216
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,864
after we stopped playing house.

217
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,183
Even if all I've done in the
kitchen was to play house,

218
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:19,354
I'd cook better than him.

219
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,205
It is dangerous, Your Highness.

220
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,033
Do you hold it like this?

221
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,294
Please watch your fingers.

222
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:35,733
Your Highness.

223
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,914
I'm not sure since this
is my first time cooking.

224
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:48,554
I feel like I should cut it like this.

225
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:52,743
Yes.

226
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:08,664
I am sure she just made it look pretty.

227
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:10,634
I bet it is not even seasoned properly.

228
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:12,864
Of course.

229
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,584
Yes. You are absolutely right.

230
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:16,743
Get off me.

231
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,195
I have been working in the
royal kitchen for 30 years.

232
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:23,144
Cooking is not an easy feat.

233
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:26,084
All right.

234
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:29,084
Let me taste it myself
to see how awful this is.

235
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,283
I doubt that it tastes any good.

236
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,933
My gosh.

237
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:56,914
Is it that awful?

238
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:00,814
I can smell shiitake mushrooms...

239
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:03,114
and green onions.

240
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:07,723
And there is a rich aroma of meat as well.

241
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,594
The aromas of the three ingredients
have come together. And this is...

242
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:28,743
"Sam" as in three, "hyang" as in fragrance,

243
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:30,914
and "ra" as in a small pot.

244
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:33,765
Three fragrances in a small pot,

245
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:35,554
so it is "samhyangra".

246
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:43,223
It is samhyang ramyeon!

247
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,124
That hits the spot.

248
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:16,023
It'd be perfect with a little MSG.

249
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,364
It's still better than nothing.

250
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:22,914
I have tasted all kinds
of delicacy thanks to you,

251
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,703
but I have never tasted
something that is amazing as this.

252
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,304
Have one more bite.

253
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:32,804
You should know that offering one
more bite of ramyeon is true love.

254
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,914
Do excuse me, then.

255
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,324
It is so...

256
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,374
I cannot believe that you,
who have never used a knife,

257
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:50,054
is better than the Royal Chef.

258
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,394
Is there anything you cannot do,
Your Highness?

259
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:59,003
Well, I used to be a perfect
person who could do anything.

260
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,933
But I can't do the most
important thing now.

261
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:06,003
The thing I was best at,
and I liked the most.

262
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:11,183
I see. Needlework?

263
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,354
Right. You were very good.

264
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,253
Yes.

265
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,804
If I touch it,

266
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,354
the flower would bloom and
butterflies would fly around.

267
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,164
It was something else.

268
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,733
All rise for His Majesty.

269
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,404
Why now out of all times?

270
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:37,044
Darn it. The noodles will get all soggy.

271
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:40,874
It's hot.

272
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:46,213
My Queen.

273
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,874
I visited the elders in the morning...

274
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:01,733
and wondered if you were doing
well last night, so I paid a visit.

275
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:04,834
Does he know about the night out?

276
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:07,433
There's no reason I'm not doing well.

277
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,304
Did you have a good night as well,
Your Majesty?

278
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:11,943
Let's change the topic.

279
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,844
She is changing the topic.

280
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,314
Thanks to you.

281
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,414
My Queen. Did you perhaps drink?

282
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,535
Me? No way.

283
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,953
Isn't it you who drank?

284
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:34,763
Is this a staring contest?

285
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,304
I did not know you were such a good liar.

286
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,814
Gosh, I'm sorry.

287
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:54,164
I'm usually pretty well-mannered,

288
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:56,213
but you came so close out of the blue.

289
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,953
It killed my nose already.

290
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,475
I have work to do. Please excuse me.

291
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,064
His Majesty.

292
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:09,933
I will go to Seonjeongjeon Hall.

293
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:11,334
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:18,844
There's no way he's actually busy.
But if he is, why did he come here?

295
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,114
Gosh, it's all soggy now.

296
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,505
Let me greet you, Your Majesty.

297
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,693
Brother.

298
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:39,545
Can you come close...

299
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,874
and tell me if my face smells?

300
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:43,134
Smell?

301
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,533
I cannot tell yet.

302
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,173
Prepare the item.

303
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,773
What on earth did My Queen eat?

304
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,973
What a disgrace!

305
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:08,055
Your Highness,
Young Master Kim Byeong In has come.

306
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,115
Oh, my cousin?

307
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,016
I owe you a lot for the last night.

308
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:18,385
I just did what I had to do.

309
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,177
As I have a guest,
I should have them bring some tea.

310
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,655
I missed you.

311
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,365
That came out of nowhere.

312
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,766
Whatever. Let's just go along with him.

313
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:34,105
I also missed you.

314
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,206
I am glad to hear that.

315
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,806
Hearing that eases all my worries.

316
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,627
Why is he so touched by that one word?

317
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,175
I heard belatedly...

318
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,786
that you had fallen into
the lake after you met me.

319
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,885
You said you were scared that day.

320
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,726
What is he talking about?

321
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:58,796
I said I was scared that day.

322
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,996
What I'm scared of is...

323
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,706
People are the scariest
things in the world.

324
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,365
Were you threatened?

325
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,627
The person who pushed
you into the lake to hurt you,

326
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:15,157
and the person who
tried to hurt you last night.

327
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,506
Do you know who they are?

328
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,716
Wait.

329
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,746
I know about the lake.

330
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:23,145
But the person who
tried to hurt me last night?

331
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,615
- What are you talking about?
- Do you not remember?

332
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,506
There an assassin tried
to attack you last night.

333
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,726
An assassin?

334
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,925
I almost died?

335
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,796
Who? Why me?

336
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:36,565
I wondered if you know,

337
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,095
but you do not.

338
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,536
What? Two people already tried to kill me?

339
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:45,936
Is this woman in danger?

340
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,506
The day you fell into the lake,

341
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,875
you said you were scared.
It might be related to that.

342
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:54,716
I think you don't know yet,
but my memory isn't all that good.

343
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:58,155
You would know what we
talked about better than I do.

344
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:00,855
Did you really...

345
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,355
lose all the memories of that day?

346
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,925
Yes. I remember nothing.

347
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,647
That's not important.

348
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,031
There was someone who was
trying to kill me. That son of...

349
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,105
What did that shameless person do to me?

350
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:22,946
It was a close call.

351
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,857
He was not an ordinary man
given his swordsmanship...

352
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,786
and the quality of his clothes.

353
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,186
I do not know how many,

354
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,655
but there were others helping him as well.

355
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:35,286
I would've been dead if it weren't for you.

356
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,026
I'm so glad we met last night.

357
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,466
Oh, no.

358
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,875
You...

359
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:00,516
Why did you come out
of the palace last night?

360
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,486
I just felt so bored that I
went out to get some fresh air.

361
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,256
If Grand Queen Dowager
knows that I left the palace,

362
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,726
I'll be in trouble.

363
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:15,577
Not only my freedom to move around
will be limited under surveillance,

364
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,266
but Hong Yeon's neck will be chopped off.

365
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,835
Can we just keep it between us?

366
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,536
But we must find the culprit.

367
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,875
You can do it quietly.

368
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,806
It will put me in big trouble. Okay?

369
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:31,375
I understand.

370
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:33,966
Who knows about your night out?

371
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,885
Hong Yeon is the only one.

372
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,915
I will have people watch her.

373
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,226
No. She's so loyal that
she would die for me.

374
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:45,741
She has nothing to do with that.

375
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,565
Your Highness,
you must not trust anyone anymore.

376
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:51,766
I have also seen her for a long time,

377
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,135
but sometimes the closest
people are the most dangerous.

378
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:58,306
Just because you are in the palace
does not mean you are safe. No.

379
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,405
Being in the palace
could be more dangerous.

380
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,845
Yes. I had forgotten where I was.

381
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,097
The palace which is filled
with all sorts of schemes.

382
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,385
A dangerous place where your life
expectancy is as short as in a war.

383
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:16,385
You need not be afraid too much.

384
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,996
I will protect you, Your Highness.

385
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,325
Thank you, but...

386
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,325
I'll protect myself.

387
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,895
It's not the time to enjoy the sights.

388
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,675
You do not need to
act strong in front of me.

389
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,355
You may have forgotten it,

390
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:51,925
but I will never forget...

391
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:55,565
the memory that has
been engraved in my heart.

392
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,936
I will do everything in my
power to find out who they are.

393
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,675
(General Store)

394
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,045
Is this the store that
sells the silk yarn...

395
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,016
from Qing?

396
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:39,106
I heard you have a valuable
item from Qing. So I am here.

397
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,615
Gosh, words travel fast.

398
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:51,885
This way.

399
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:13,135
Do you keep such a valuable
item in a filthy place like this?

400
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,575
It is because it is too valuable.

401
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,295
Here.

402
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,155
What is this?

403
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,436
So you close one of your eyes.

404
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,116
And turn it like this. This
is what you do with this.

405
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,456
Excuse me. Is anyone here?

406
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,675
Coming!

407
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,786
I believe you have misunderstood me.

408
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,146
I am here to buy the silk yarn from...

409
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,345
I wanted to buy the silk yarn.

410
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,985
What am I supposed
to do with this odd pipe?

411
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,886
Kim Byeong In told me not to trust anyone.

412
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,275
Then, how can I trust him?

413
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:23,991
There's no way Hong
Yeon would try to hurt me.

414
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,715
Or did Jo Hwa Jin try to harm me again?

415
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,366
A week is too long.

416
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,230
At this rate,
I might die without knowing why.

417
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,766
Let's just do what I'm good at.

418
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,186
I'll win them over with food.

419
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,155
My food can pierce through armor.

420
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,550
I'm sure it will work on the
Grand Queen Dowager too.

421
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,695
Hold on.

422
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:46,536
Is that the meal the Grand
Queen Dowager didn't finish?

423
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,806
Yes, Your Highness.

424
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,206
Let me see.

425
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,456
The unfinished meals of the royal family...

426
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,826
reveal important information such
as one's health and preferences.

427
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,496
So you are not allowed
to look at the meals.

428
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,646
Take it away.

429
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,686
What are you doing? I'm the Queen.

430
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,155
Please forgive me,

431
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,667
but everyone calls me the Royal Chef.

432
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:09,567
That means in the royal kitchen,

433
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:11,595
I am the boss.

434
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:15,266
Then, we should let our culinary
skills speak for themselves.

435
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,066
Let's see who's the boss here.

436
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,635
I beg you not to say such a thing.

437
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:26,075
I must prepare the royal meal now. Goodbye.

438
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:28,976
Gosh. You're scared that you might lose,
right?

439
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,590
To someone like me who had never
cooked except when playing house.

440
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:49,666
All right. How is the meal coming along?

441
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,525
Gosh.

442
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,417
- Go for it, Your Highness!
- Go for it, Your Highness!

443
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,286
- Go, Your Highness! - Go, Your Highness!

444
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,516
- Go, Your Highness! - Go, Royal Chef!

445
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,116
- Royal Chef! - Your Highness!

446
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,426
- Royal Chef! - Your Highness!

447
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,187
- Royal Chef! - Your Highness!

448
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,627
- Royal Chef! - Your Highness!

449
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:46,416
- Royal Chef! - Your Highness!

450
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,836
Hold on.

451
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,376
Oh, no.

452
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:08,905
Darn it.

453
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,646
In cooking,

454
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,366
speed is important.

455
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,237
But the flavors are more important.

456
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:20,456
Right.

457
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,846
- You. - Me?

458
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,246
Seeing how your robes are different,
I'm guessing you don't work here.

459
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,317
What is your position?

460
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:34,717
I am in charge of
handling the royal offerings.

461
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,821
I am the Head Inspector
at the Royal Cuisine Office.

462
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,635
- You'll taste the food. - Me?

463
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:41,826
Everyone here is his minion.

464
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,976
They won't be able to
evaluate the food honestly.

465
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:45,416
Come and taste it.

466
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:47,985
Yes, Your Highness.

467
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,755
All right, then.

468
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:02,756
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E03 'Mr. Queen'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

469
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,666
I have never tasted
anything like this before.

470
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,556
Like the name, yeolgujatang,

471
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,036
this dish does please my mouth.

472
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,075
In my entire life,
my tongue has never tasted anything so...

473
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,575
Well...

474
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:29,425
Who are you?

475
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,886
How dare a girl walk
into the royal kitchen?

476
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,865
That brat.

477
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,345
That was meant for me, right?

478
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,845
"How dare a girl walk
into the royal kitchen?"

479
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,686
No... Of course not.

480
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,626
Your Highness.

481
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,496
Shut it.

482
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:16,346
I was faster.

483
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,106
And my food tastes great.

484
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,746
As long as I'm in the kitchen,

485
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,916
I'm the boss here.

486
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,045
Everyone, work with me here.

487
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,326
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,516
That little...

489
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:40,226
From now on,
learn from this girl and do better. Okay?

490
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:47,066
Your Highness,
His Majesty is in Daejojeon Hall now.

491
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,545
Why are you here so early tonight?

492
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,816
I missed you, My Queen.

493
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:01,945
You're quite the funny guy today.

494
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,186
It's about time that you
head to the royal villa.

495
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,655
- "Special Forces". - What?

496
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,795
Is there anything you want
to tell me about that word?

497
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:14,195
- Is this some sort of word game? - Well...

498
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,766
Go away right now.

499
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,735
"Army cook".

500
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,566
What?

501
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,257
Gosh. You're the King, after all.

502
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:28,456
What if you kill me because of what I said?

503
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,706
Go ahead.

504
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,876
You're talking a load of nonsense.

505
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:40,297
You are foul-mouthed for no reason.

506
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:42,856
You really must be unhappy about the world.

507
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,476
Tell me everything that bothers you.

508
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,896
I will not be going to
the royal villa today.

509
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,166
No. Nothing is bothering me.

510
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,595
Lately, I've been thinking
of how perfect my life is now.

511
00:42:55,211 --> 00:42:57,365
Did you see anyone today?

512
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,156
What do you want to know?

513
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,706
How much of it did you hear?

514
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:04,715
I just want to know how your day was.

515
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,476
I will go after we exchange a few words.

516
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:14,856
Well, my cousin came by to see me.

517
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,667
Your cousin?

518
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,896
Was his name Kim Byeong In?

519
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:21,507
What was his reason?

520
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:25,166
Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated?

521
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,996
You are being overly sensitive.

522
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,087
I am only asking because I
am worried that there might be...

523
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,717
something wrong with my in-laws.

524
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:32,936
It's nothing.

525
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,056
He came to congratulate me on
the royal wedding and to say hello.

526
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,206
If that is the case, I am relieved.

527
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,746
May I ask why you hate
me so much these days?

528
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:46,215
Is she hostile to me because
she knows I am the assassin?

529
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,937
We're married now.

530
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,667
Even if you were madly in love,

531
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:52,456
once you get married that turns to hate.

532
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,695
Are you satisfied now? Go.

533
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,436
Listen here. Bring in the bedding.

534
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:03,336
What are you doing? This
isn't what you promised.

535
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:06,187
I am tired after our conversation,

536
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,646
so I do not have the energy to
go back to Huijeongjeon Hall.

537
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:15,916
I knew it. Win during
the day and fade at night.

538
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:25,151
No matter how much I think about it,
he's suspicious.

539
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,930
No matter how much I think about it,
she is suspicious.

540
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,606
Your Highness,

541
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:37,405
you must not trust anyone anymore.

542
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,116
Right. This guy is the
most untrustworthy person.

543
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,886
Regardless of time and place,

544
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,976
the prime suspect when a wife
gets murdered is her husband.

545
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,325
She may say something in her sleep.

546
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,786
What if he tries something while I sleep?

547
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:00,401
- I must not fall asleep.
- I must not fall asleep.

548
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,155
No.

549
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,695
No! No, you must not!

550
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,795
No, you must not! No.

551
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:13,336
No.

552
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,005
Hey. What's wrong?

553
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:18,005
Oh, my. He'll die at this rate.

554
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,706
Hey. Wake up. Wake up!

555
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,956
Hwa Jin.

556
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,226
You saved my life once again.

557
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,755
Thank you.

558
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,755
Have you lost your mind?

559
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,095
Gosh.

560
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,766
Hwa Jin.

561
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,766
- My Queen. - Darn it.

562
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,235
Do you think I would
die if you hit me like that?

563
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,826
You looked like you
would die if I left you alone.

564
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,246
You were writhing about so much.

565
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:03,715
I believe you hit me because
I said another woman's name.

566
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,916
Do not be worried.

567
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,737
That doesn't matter to me,

568
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:12,425
so let's just stick to no touching.

569
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:16,396
You said that again.

570
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,116
Now that you're up,

571
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,346
you should go to Huijeongjeon
Hall or the royal villa,

572
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,235
so you can sleep comfortably.

573
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:28,476
If I move so early in the morning,
those who serve me will suffer.

574
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,715
You are quite the gracious king.

575
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,016
Thank you, My Queen, for your compliment.

576
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,437
Goodness, My Queen.

577
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,755
You are being too selfish.

578
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,235
You are very strong.

579
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,036
Just sleep quietly and go.

580
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:01,806
Sharing is a virtue of a gracious king.

581
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,095
It is strange. Whenever I sleep
in Daejojeon Hall, my body is sore.

582
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,217
That is why we should
no longer sleep together.

583
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,516
It must be because I am
not accustomed to this place.

584
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,905
I should stay here until I
become accustomed to it.

585
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,345
I don't want to be forced to wake
up because of your nightmares again.

586
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:43,996
I do not know about any nightmares,

587
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,197
but I do remember being hit for
saying another woman's name...

588
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,885
when I woke up.

589
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,925
I will make sure that
I call out your name...

590
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,095
tonight, without fail.

591
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:00,496
Gosh, I lost my appetite.

592
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,706
If you aren't going to eat anymore,
you should go. I'm busy.

593
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,405
Why are you so busy?

594
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,345
Work.

595
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,215
I can't get anyone's phone
number or use SNS here,

596
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,416
so I have no choice but to work for it.

597
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,746
SNS?

598
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,456
"SNS".

599
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:25,056
Does that mean love is "soft not severe"?

600
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,325
I will treat you that way tonight.

601
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,115
Bull's eye!

602
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:49,096
Nice!

603
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,146
When did you learn how to do this?

604
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,956
You are embarrassing me.

605
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:57,425
Should I show off what I can do?

606
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:58,795
Okay.

607
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:11,135
So...

608
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,786
One thing led to another, and I ended up...

609
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,845
slept with the King a few nights in a row.

610
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,345
But I'm not really sleeping with the King.

611
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,615
We're pretending to sleep together.

612
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,720
You must know because he went
to the royal villa the other night.

613
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,507
But I don't know what
was up with him last night.

614
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:30,536
I told him to go to the royal villa,
but he refused to go.

615
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,377
But don't worry.

616
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,877
Nothing happened all night,
and nothing will ever happen.

617
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:39,336
Did you ask to see me so
that you can tell me that?

618
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,896
No, the thing is...

619
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,635
Is she really the person
behind the lake incident?

620
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,206
Even the second incident?

621
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,306
If that's the case, stop for a few days.

622
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,476
I have a hard time dealing with
being hated by a beautiful woman.

623
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,016
I would like it if you didn't hate me.

624
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,556
The wind must not have
been in your favor this time.

625
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,095
If you trust in me and
wait a couple days...

626
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,996
Do you know who the one person
I cannot trust in this palace is?

627
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,195
It is you, Your Highness. Therefore,

628
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,505
I do not believe in anything
you have just told me.

629
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:22,876
Therefore, if you are trying to
come between His Majesty and me,

630
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:24,476
you should give up.

631
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,246
I've completely turned over a new leaf.

632
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,340
Can't you tell that I'm a different person?

633
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,897
You have changed for the worse.

634
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,956
You act so kind to my face,

635
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,956
but behind my back,
you are framing me for the lake incident.

636
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:40,195
I have never framed you for that.

637
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,706
Since we don't know who did it,

638
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,925
you must be suspected
because of where you were.

639
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:47,266
You know who did it.

640
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:54,135
The person who did it...

641
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,405
was yourself, Your Highness.

642
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,255
You fell into the water on purpose...

643
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,956
in order to frame me.

644
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,436
Seeing as to how mad she got,
she's not lying.

645
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,036
I now know why she looked
at me with such a cold gaze.

646
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,775
The lake incident was fabricated.
What's left is the assassin.

647
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:33,715
Regardless, the fact that
someone is after me doesn't change.

648
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,816
Your Highness,
you should return to Daejojeon Hall now.

649
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,686
You should go to Daejojeon Hall,
Court Lady Choi.

650
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,107
If something happens, make something up...

651
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,666
and have Hong Yeon tell me.

652
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,877
I cannot do...

653
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,496
That is how you can save me.

654
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,336
Please do this for me.

655
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:57,666
Come here.

656
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,135
Royal Chef.

657
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,606
How many times do you serve
the Grand Queen Dowager a meal?

658
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,726
I do not know how many
times we serve her a meal,

659
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,445
but we serve her multiple times a day.

660
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,025
I wasn't going to say this,

661
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,095
There are many people in
Joseon who could be a royal chef.

662
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,016
I serve a jentacular meal,
breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea,

663
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,217
dinner, a nighttime snack,

664
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:31,806
and water in-between the meals.

665
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,357
And does she eat them all?

666
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:35,075
Once every three to four days,

667
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,646
she asks us not to serve lunch.

668
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,115
On a day like that,
she asks for honey and ginger powder.

669
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,607
If you see the food
that she hasn't touched,

670
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:53,325
they're cold or chewy food.

671
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,476
But she doesn't ask them to
take them out of the menu...

672
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,126
because she wants to hide it.

673
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,706
I mainly look at their physiognomy,
rather than skills.

674
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:05,575
They are all handsome, are they not?

675
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,806
- Bang. - Bang.

676
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:09,405
What are you doing?

677
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,996
Do you think the sound of
gunpowder is as quiet as that?

678
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,167
Say it louder. "Bang"!

679
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:17,186
- Bang! - Bang!

680
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,797
Gosh. Our dear Minister of War,
you must have been so startled.

681
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:22,626
Who do you think you are touching?

682
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:27,036
By the way, I heard you asked the King...

683
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,647
to place you in the Royal
Commandery Division.

684
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,817
The Royal Commandery
Division is not like the military,

685
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:33,547
so it is called Idle Division.

686
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,047
I heard people
gossiping about it like that,

687
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,246
so I thought this was it.

688
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,075
I do not like being busy.

689
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,806
- The item? - Is it tonight?

690
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,956
Yes.

691
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,547
It is fly mushroom powder.

692
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,487
It has no scent and no flavor.

693
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:12,575
If you mix it with alcohol,
it makes people confess anything.

694
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,587
But if the Queen knows something,

695
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:18,175
she cannot be this quiet.

696
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,600
She is either plotting
something behind our backs...

697
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,715
or waiting for the right moment.

698
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,916
We should make sure.

699
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,025
Prince Yeongpyeong
does not have big ambitions.

700
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:39,817
All he does is stick to His Majesty,

701
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:42,465
and gamble with Special Director Hong...

702
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,606
at night.

703
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:51,275
Special Director Hong...

704
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:54,746
is still a loafer who is
bumming off of the military.

705
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:57,967
The Royal Commandery
Division is in name only anyway.

706
00:55:57,991 --> 00:55:59,586
It would be better to let him be.

707
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,437
He lost not only his father and brother...

708
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:05,056
but also his mother and
grandparents in front of his eyes.

709
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,595
It must have taught him a lesson.

710
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,766
When will you be appointed as
the Royal Guard Commander?

711
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:15,187
Is there a problem?

712
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:18,536
It is because I want to sort
things out before he is appointed.

713
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,316
Did you play the interest game
with the military rice again?

714
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:28,516
Do not cross the line.

715
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,027
How many times have I told you...

716
00:56:31,051 --> 00:56:33,131
that an unstable military
poses the greatest danger?

717
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,816
Yes.

718
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:37,286
I will make sure everything is fine.

719
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,500
No matter how much I think about it,

720
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:45,166
I feel like some dangerous guys
are roaming outside the palace.

721
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:46,766
What do you mean?

722
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:49,936
On my way to Oktajeong a few days ago...

723
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,436
Did you say Oktajeong a few days ago?

724
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,886
Yes. I made a good friend.

725
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,416
He has a great name
as well. Lee Saeng Mang.

726
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:01,575
"Lee Saeng Mang".

727
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:03,586
Do you know him?

728
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,697
No. The name sounds familiar somehow.

729
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:09,885
He must be the son of
a famous noble family.

730
00:57:10,131 --> 00:57:11,655
But I have never heard the name.

731
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:16,447
So on my way to Oktajeong with my friend,

732
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:19,417
I took a blow of some sort
without realizing what was coming...

733
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:21,036
and fainted.

734
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,817
After I woke up,

735
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:29,045
I found my friend called Lee Saeng
Mang had disappeared like a ghost.

736
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,746
Do you remember his outfit?

737
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,775
- Sure. - Did he...

738
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,485
wear a robe made of this fabric?

739
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,056
No.

740
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,126
I see.

741
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,066
If you ever see your
friend that disappeared,

742
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,566
tell me what happened.

743
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,505
Does it mean...

744
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,127
you are giving me a special mission?

745
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:05,106
It is not as grand as a "special mission".

746
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,016
You.

747
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:13,016
You go to the palace every
day but have nothing to do.

748
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:14,956
What do you mean I have nothing to do?

749
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,107
It takes all day...

750
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:18,726
just to greet people I know.

751
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:24,766
There is a task you are perfect for.

752
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:27,036
An actual special mission.

753
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,235
Finally...

754
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:50,925
(No touch)

755
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,925
(No touch)

756
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:01,695
Your Majesty.

757
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,036
Prince Yeongpyeong has come.

758
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,306
Come in.

759
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,246
Do you know what this means,
Prince Yeongpyeong?

760
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:14,976
I beg your pardon?

761
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,416
Come and have a look.

762
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,437
"No touch"?

763
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:27,176
According to the Queen,
it means "Let us each be happy".

764
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,566
But what would be the origin of the word?

765
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,496
I have never heard of it.

766
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:39,436
Could it be from Buddhist texts?

767
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,885
I would like to have
some tea with my brother.

768
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,556
Yes, Your Majesty.

769
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,547
I am thinking of what the Queen said...

770
01:00:06,571 --> 01:00:09,865
as some of the weird words she
said might have some meaning.

771
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,465
I see.

772
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,005
This is the item you asked for.

773
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,246
Well done.

774
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,786
Is it today?

775
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:24,916
The quicker, the better.

776
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,522
That's right.

777
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,622
Put more mud there.

778
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:33,823
Yes.

779
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:39,102
It is your order,

780
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:41,213
but if you ruin the furnace like this...

781
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,702
I'm not ruining it. I'm upgrading it.

782
01:00:44,677 --> 01:00:46,443
What kind of pumpkin head...

783
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:57,852
You, pumpkin head, that stone is too small!

784
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:00,182
Why? Is it heavy?

785
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:03,022
Let me help you. This stone looks nice.

786
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:04,233
It is too big, Chef.

787
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:05,844
Why would you put that on it?

788
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,304
- Your Highness! - Is that the oil?

789
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:09,574
Yes. As you ordered,
I brought all kinds of oil...

790
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:11,374
including rapeseed oil,
sesame oil, perilla oil,

791
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:13,313
and basically everything I could find.

792
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,033
You did a great job.

793
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:22,083
It is such a valuable thing.

794
01:01:22,107 --> 01:01:24,843
Your Highness. That oil is a year's worth.

795
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:27,463
80 percent of cooking is
completed by the ingredients.

796
01:01:27,487 --> 01:01:29,082
My fate depends on this food.

797
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:31,563
Your Highness.

798
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,633
It has been long since His
Majesty entered Daejojeon Hall.

799
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,604
Tell him I'm performing my filial duty.

800
01:01:36,628 --> 01:01:39,062
Oh, no. She poured everything.

801
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,023
How can you bring all
the precious gifts we have?

802
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:03,653
I could have died if I had
not brought everything.

803
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:06,534
We can get more gifts
if we threaten people.

804
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:08,022
Why would you worry?

805
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:16,392
She did not even scale it.
What is she going to do?

806
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:24,403
That is such a precious ingredient.

807
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:33,213
Okay. It's done. Great.

808
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:39,034
Well done.

809
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:40,783
- Take this. - Yes.

810
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:42,993
- Put that deep inside it. - Pardon?

811
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:45,258
- I said put that deep inside it.
- Yes, Your Highness.

812
01:02:55,368 --> 01:02:56,673
This is it.

813
01:02:57,837 --> 01:03:01,073
She is burning the highest
quality croaker just like that.

814
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:04,042
It is such a bizarre...

815
01:03:22,228 --> 01:03:25,144
Your Majesty, please forgive
me for overstepping my bounds,

816
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,784
but Her Highness is at the Royal Kitchen...

817
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:30,932
to supervise the Grand
Queen Dowager's meal.

818
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:34,642
I understand. I will wait.

819
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:37,113
Please forgive me.

820
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:51,823
She is avoiding my company.

821
01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:31,043
Are you all right?

822
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:33,033
Gosh, I dozed off a bit there.

823
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:41,743
My fate is dependent on you.

824
01:04:57,657 --> 01:04:59,423
This will sting.

825
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:14,243
Tell her.

826
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:21,013
I said I do not need lunch today.

827
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:26,182
The Queen made it by herself.

828
01:05:30,328 --> 01:05:33,463
- The Queen cooked? - Yes, Your Highness.

829
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:37,892
She spent all night making it.

830
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:40,133
I am thankful for the effort,

831
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,973
but what on earth is this made of?

832
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:48,042
It looks different.

833
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:50,753
She cooked beef, pork,

834
01:05:50,777 --> 01:05:54,943
and croaker together.

835
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,082
It looks like embroidery rather than food.

836
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:03,053
I really do not have an appetite,

837
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:06,423
but you said she spent all night making it.

838
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:09,057
I am grateful for the effort,
so I will have just one bite.

839
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,593
Still nothing from her?

840
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:39,792
No.

841
01:06:44,998 --> 01:06:46,963
This won't do. I'll go myself.

842
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:49,932
The Grand Queen Dowager is here.

843
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:08,352
- Is it a success? - How could you?

844
01:07:11,357 --> 01:07:12,522
A failure?

845
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:18,263
Why did you hide such talent?

846
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:19,862
Pardon?

847
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:24,933
I do not know how long it has
been since I enjoyed food so much.

848
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:27,224
I was so touched by the food...

849
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:29,202
that it made me angry!

850
01:07:30,517 --> 01:07:32,072
It's a big success.

851
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,853
I am glad you liked it.

852
01:07:37,288 --> 01:07:39,483
Of course I liked it.

853
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:42,452
I think I could eat it every day.

854
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,652
How on earth did you make it?

855
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:47,804
The soft texture I have never felt before,

856
01:07:47,828 --> 01:07:50,063
and the rich flavor.

857
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:53,783
I cooked it in oil on very low heat...

858
01:07:53,807 --> 01:07:57,303
all night.

859
01:07:59,277 --> 01:08:01,554
I put oil-brushed fish in an
earthen oven with charcoal,

860
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,154
so it can be cooked
over low heat overnight.

861
01:08:03,178 --> 01:08:06,843
I wanted the skin to be crispy
and the meat to be tender.

862
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:10,434
For the chewier meat,
I put it deep in the oil in the cauldron...

863
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:13,383
and cooked it at a low heat overnight.

864
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:17,952
This method retains the nutrients
of the food as well as the flavor.

865
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:21,673
It is also good for health and anti-aging.

866
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,114
It is a very healthy food.

867
01:08:23,138 --> 01:08:27,563
This is called confit,
a French cooking technique.

868
01:08:27,868 --> 01:08:30,502
Not only is it delicious, but also healthy?

869
01:08:32,437 --> 01:08:35,303
Where did you learn such a method?

870
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:38,273
Shall I call it inspiration?

871
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:41,793
As I thought about how
to please Your Highness...

872
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,313
for many days...

873
01:08:47,227 --> 01:08:49,992
It's time for the final blow.

874
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,093
I will help you every day.

875
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,063
For the rest of your life,

876
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,723
you will be youthful,

877
01:08:56,538 --> 01:08:58,133
and healthy.

878
01:09:06,878 --> 01:09:10,843
I will let them fill the lake with water.

879
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:33,083
It will take forever to fill it this way!

880
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:35,662
It will take ten days at the earliest.

881
01:09:36,378 --> 01:09:38,554
No. Fill it right now.

882
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:40,542
Or I will chop off your neck.

883
01:09:40,907 --> 01:09:42,202
Move, move!

884
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,643
Move, move!

885
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:52,013
That just added two days.

886
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:54,383
Everyone, stop!

887
01:09:57,597 --> 01:09:59,923
I have a way.

888
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:03,133
Here comes the water!

889
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:06,014
- Here. - Okay.

890
01:10:06,038 --> 01:10:08,263
Here comes the water!

891
01:10:09,267 --> 01:10:12,283
Yes, yes, I did not know there
would be such a convenient way.

892
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:14,343
That is right. Great.

893
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:17,412
- Take it quickly. - Here.

894
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:29,934
What a revolutionary system it is!

895
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,393
Nice. Very nice.

896
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:34,904
Don't even think about
sleeping before filling up the lake.

897
01:10:34,928 --> 01:10:36,648
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

898
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:56,452
Hong Yeon, he said.

899
01:10:57,357 --> 01:11:00,122
If that kind face is a mask,

900
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:05,223
she can fool everyone but
these sharp eyes of mine.

901
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:21,902
It is indeed a rare fabric,

902
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,572
but I am not capable enough
to figure out where it is from.

903
01:11:31,258 --> 01:11:33,053
But...

904
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:36,423
I should try.

905
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:41,393
Would it not be right to try
my best if I am not capable?

906
01:11:41,628 --> 01:11:43,433
I like that attitude.

907
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:51,233
I was worried that His Majesty
does not care for the Queen.

908
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,942
I do not have to worry myself over it now.

909
01:11:56,147 --> 01:11:57,643
Is there any other news?

910
01:11:58,578 --> 01:12:01,724
While the Queen was spending...

911
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:03,853
the night at the Royal Kitchen,

912
01:12:04,088 --> 01:12:06,322
the King was desperately waiting for her...

913
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:09,423
alone at Daejojeon Hall.

914
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:13,862
I told him to go to Huijeongjeon Hall,
but he insisted on staying.

915
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:20,002
I cannot believe that His Majesty
is fretting over the Queen so much.

916
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:23,202
I understand. You may leave now.

917
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:25,773
Yes, Your Highness.

918
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,953
They must sleep together often...

919
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:33,742
to develop feelings for each other.

920
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:37,452
The Queen promised me with confidence.

921
01:12:38,057 --> 01:12:39,213
A promise?

922
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,983
She said she would make
sure to conceive a prince.

923
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:43,423
Goodness!

924
01:12:43,657 --> 01:12:45,434
Then does that mean our family...

925
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,763
will have a blood-born prince?

926
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:52,192
What is this?

927
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:54,233
Oh, right.

928
01:12:55,607 --> 01:12:56,803
Here.

929
01:12:57,178 --> 01:13:00,603
If you eat this, your skin will regenerate.

930
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,112
This is such a precious thing.

931
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,894
If you are satisfied after you have it,

932
01:13:05,918 --> 01:13:09,143
I will do whatever it takes
to bring you some more.

933
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:11,383
Thank you.

934
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:17,292
Goodness. I had no idea such
a wonderful day would come.

935
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:20,723
When the Queen fell into the lake,

936
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:23,032
I was so upset.

937
01:13:23,937 --> 01:13:25,474
She is such an innocent child.

938
01:13:25,498 --> 01:13:28,633
I am so proud that she is
able to endure her position well.

939
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:32,032
It brings tears to my eyes.

940
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:34,643
You must speak properly.

941
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:36,942
Honestly, she is not an innocent child.

942
01:13:37,147 --> 01:13:40,013
Our Queen is... How should I put it?

943
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,412
Clever?

944
01:13:44,657 --> 01:13:45,983
No, not quite.

945
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:49,622
- Meticulous. - No.

946
01:13:49,998 --> 01:13:52,553
There must be a more direct word.

947
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:55,523
- Then... - Fastidious?

948
01:13:55,968 --> 01:13:57,162
Why you...

949
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:01,862
Unique?

950
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:05,202
That is right. Unique.
She is a unique child.

951
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,883
She is perfectly suited to be the queen.

952
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:09,242
That is right.

953
01:14:09,618 --> 01:14:13,582
She reminds me of you in your youth.

954
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:15,442
That is not true!

955
01:14:23,298 --> 01:14:24,604
Are you crazy?

956
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:27,292
Did you see it with your
own two eyes? Did you?

957
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:30,173
Did anyone in this
palace see Her Highness...

958
01:14:30,197 --> 01:14:31,763
push the Queen?

959
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,344
Do we need to see it?
Everyone in the palace knows!

960
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:36,984
- That is right. - Right.

961
01:14:37,008 --> 01:14:38,083
Everybody knows this.

962
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:41,702
The guiltier you are,
the louder you behave.

963
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:43,973
Rumors do not spread for no reason.

964
01:14:49,788 --> 01:14:51,013
Why you...

965
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:54,304
Starting tomorrow,
a rumor will spread that you are bald.

966
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:55,604
You crazy wench.

967
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,474
Let go. I said let go.

968
01:14:57,498 --> 01:14:58,822
Let go!

969
01:14:59,597 --> 01:15:01,692
The Queen framed her!

970
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:03,474
When Her Highness was passing by the lake,

971
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:05,713
the Queen purposely jumped in.

972
01:15:05,737 --> 01:15:07,603
You should check the facts before you talk!

973
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:26,183
Tonight, I will surely...

974
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:55,513
Your Majesty. I thought you were
going to practice your calligraphy.

975
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:57,734
The other day, I went to Yejang...

976
01:15:57,758 --> 01:16:00,053
to play some tujeon with
Special Director Hong...

977
01:16:00,388 --> 01:16:02,553
when I saw something incredible.

978
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:09,692
It was stabbing something
from far away using this dagger.

979
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:14,832
I thought that I might
be able to do it as well.

980
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:18,114
It is dangerous.

981
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:20,002
What will you do if you get hurt?

982
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,782
How long have you and I known each other?

983
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:35,983
It is just over two years now.

984
01:16:39,798 --> 01:16:40,893
I see.

985
01:16:44,937 --> 01:16:48,684
In that short time,
you have figured out everything about me,

986
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:50,303
and you have become my hands and feet.

987
01:16:50,477 --> 01:16:53,173
It is as if we have known
each other for a longer timer.

988
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:57,473
It is only natural that I
do so as that is my role.

989
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,112
"Natural".

990
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:03,533
It may be natural to your role,

991
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:05,064
but when I look at your loyalty,

992
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,683
I can tell if you are doing it
because it is natural to do so...

993
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:09,622
or...

994
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:13,692
if you are doing it sincerely.

995
01:17:15,628 --> 01:17:17,532
I see your sincerity.

996
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,803
Thank you so much for recognizing that,
Your Majesty.

997
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,402
Do you trust me?

998
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:28,202
If I do not trust you, who could I trust...

999
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:37,252
It is harder than it seems.

1000
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:41,553
But do you not trust me enough?

1001
01:17:44,557 --> 01:17:46,792
Please forgive me.

1002
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:49,463
As I get older, I become more cowardly.

1003
01:17:51,468 --> 01:17:53,933
I will enter Daejojeon
Hall a bit early today.

1004
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:55,902
I will make the preparations.

1005
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:35,372
I am finally seeing you,
now that I came early.

1006
01:18:37,048 --> 01:18:38,912
You are quite the diligent type.

1007
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,024
You're making such an
effort to sleep together.

1008
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:43,353
We have prepared some
wine and food for you.

1009
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:45,963
What's with the wine and food?

1010
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,883
I know you enjoy drinking,

1011
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,822
so I asked them to prepare it for you.

1012
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:51,523
I quit drinking.

1013
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:55,593
I thought you might say that...

1014
01:18:57,267 --> 01:18:59,233
I have prepared some refreshments for you.

1015
01:19:12,218 --> 01:19:13,843
This is Arabian jasmine tea.

1016
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,594
If you drink this when you
have insomnia or worries,

1017
01:19:17,618 --> 01:19:19,152
it will relax you.

1018
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:28,192
Oh, jasmine tea.

1019
01:19:28,668 --> 01:19:30,633
It smells quite strong.

1020
01:19:40,477 --> 01:19:43,673
I smelled this that night
too. It filled the entire room.

1021
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:52,452
This scent was embedded
into his sleeve too.

1022
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,313
It was you.

1023
01:20:29,527 --> 01:20:30,822
You were...

1024
01:20:31,697 --> 01:20:34,023
It's dangerous to reveal the truth rashly.

1025
01:20:37,638 --> 01:20:42,862
Especially if it's in this palace
where everyone has secrets.

1026
01:20:55,088 --> 01:20:56,463
(Mr. Queen)

1027
01:20:56,487 --> 01:20:57,493
(This drama is fictional
and all characters, families, )

1028
01:20:57,517 --> 01:20:59,877
(dynasties, and events are
unrelated to historical events.)

1029
01:21:16,368 --> 01:21:18,814
Did I fall for the Queen's
lying eyes and words?

1030
01:21:18,838 --> 01:21:20,554
Make sure she reveals this too.

1031
01:21:20,578 --> 01:21:22,753
- Who sent this letter?
- It was the Queen Dowager.

1032
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:24,293
Just until the lake is filled with water.

1033
01:21:24,317 --> 01:21:26,694
I will endure it quietly
until then and then go back.

1034
01:21:26,718 --> 01:21:28,463
The person we are
looking for is a court lady.

1035
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:31,364
You must take special
care not to be caught.

1036
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:33,833
I found the source of this fabric.

1037
01:21:33,857 --> 01:21:35,104
It is the palace.

1038
01:21:35,128 --> 01:21:37,073
You are after the Royal Noble Consort,
not me.

1039
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:39,703
Wanting to return what
happened. That is revenge.

1040
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,162
- Just like I did to you.
- Do you think I can't do it?

1041
01:21:42,186 --> 01:21:44,186
