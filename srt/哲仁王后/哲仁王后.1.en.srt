(This drama is fictional and
all characters, organizations, )

00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,055
(and events are unrelated
to historical events.)

3
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,468
(Episode 1)

4
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,929
No matter how
fierce a beast may be,

5
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,848
it would never bite the
hand that feeds him.

6
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:30,217
It would wag its tail.

7
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,399
When I first started
cooking at the age of 13,

8
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:36,327
my dream was to work at
the Blue House no matter what.

9
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:39,628
I wanted to become the person
to feed the strongest person.

10
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,128
That's how I became a chef.

11
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,208
As you mentioned earlier,
you became...

12
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:47,379
the youngest chef
in the Blue House.

13
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,138
- I was the first. - Pardon?

14
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,708
Here.

15
00:01:58,012 --> 00:01:59,117
Here's the cod.

16
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,017
This is fine.

17
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,969
The ambassador is particularly
sensitive to fish bones.

18
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,398
Please pay attention to that.

19
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,327
My gosh.

20
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,848
If you say that one more time,

21
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,868
all he'll get is a fish head.

22
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:27,678
The chef is preparing
the fish personally,

23
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:29,129
so you don't need to worry.

24
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:31,178
Is he Emperor Qin Shi
Huang or something?

25
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,648
Emperor Qin Shi Huang?

26
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,547
Fish cakes were made because
of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.

27
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,969
Emperor Qin Shi Huang
abused his power so much that...

28
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,038
despite eating fish every day
because he loved it so much,

29
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,669
if there was a single bone,

30
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,228
he would cut off the head
of the chef who made it.

31
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:48,779
Every day, chefs would die,

32
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,603
but a new chef that
started working thought...

33
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,148
he would end up dead for sure.

34
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,618
He was lost in despair...

35
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,008
as he absentmindedly cut up
the fish on the cutting board.

36
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,038
Then, eureka.

37
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,278
He was very lucky.

38
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,618
You might be wondering how a
person could kill another over some food,

39
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,588
but it's not just some food.

40
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:15,757
A properly-made meal could
open up the most guarded heart.

41
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:20,458
You might even call it the
most charming bullet in the world.

42
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:26,238
So this is the mindset I have
when I cook in the Blue House,

43
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,608
"Cooking is politics."

44
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,989
Since we're on the topic,
let's hear some stories...

45
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,418
that everyone is
most curious about.

46
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:38,907
For example,
what are some secrets about the Blue House?

47
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,118
Before that,
let me make this clear.

48
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,287
My name will not be revealed,

49
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:47,217
and I will get paid
in cash. Okay?

50
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,379
Oh, that? There was a short
circuit due to a water leak,

51
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,727
and it's been broken for a week.

52
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,608
Did it get broken,
or did someone break it?

53
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:06,778
There are times when we need
to turn a blind eye to these things.

54
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,708
Thanks to that,
I get to benefit from it too.

55
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:14,499
But is it okay for
us to be like this?

56
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:17,098
If the main dish has been served,
it's game over.

57
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:20,157
Right now, the Chinese ambassador
is getting a taste of paradise.

(The Vibrant Republic of Korea)

59
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,917
Chef Jang! Find Chef Jang!

60
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:51,847
Chef Jang!

61
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:54,858
- Where are you? - My goodness.

62
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,488
It's tiring to be so good too.

63
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:00,508
The ambassador
loved my food so much...

64
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,667
that he wants to
compliment me himself?

65
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:04,879
I'll be right back, Sun Young.

66
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,368
My name is Hye Jung.

67
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,137
The name Sun
Young fits you better.

68
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:24,218
(Episode 1: Jang Bong
Hwan in Wonderland)

69
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:31,212
(Beware of Dog. If you interrupt,
you will be bitten.)

70
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,668
Oh, my.

71
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,767
Taek. You should do it.

72
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,059
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan.

73
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,323
It's the Jongno Police Station
Criminal Affairs Division.

74
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:56,129
Chef Jang,
that jerk's last name is Jang,

75
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,099
so he goes around calling
himself the best chef around,

76
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,257
so I feel like I'm losing
because of my name.

77
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:03,008
Once the business to
globalize Korean food starts,

78
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:06,728
the name that will spread
across the world is Bu Seung Min.

79
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,338
It's not Jang Bong Hwan.

80
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,508
Do a good job. Make sure
to keep everyone quiet.

81
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,668
Right.

82
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,337
They mustn't
mistake us for this.

83
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,207
We're clean.

84
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,532
(Beware of Dog. If you interrupt,
you will be bitten.)

85
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:28,198
Goodness. You scared us.

86
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,028
You must accompany
us to the station.

87
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,398
The fishing hook incident...

88
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,398
has been resolved as something
that happened while fishing,

89
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,039
and I took responsibility and
was removed from my post.

90
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,068
What else is there?

91
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:38,732
There's circumstantial evidence
for ingredient delivery corruption.

92
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,598
How much?

93
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,549
It was quite substantial
over a duration of two years.

94
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,368
And the circumstantial
evidence points to me?

95
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:47,749
Who said that?

96
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,588
We just wanted to get a
statement for our investigation.

97
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,608
Gosh, you're terrible at acting.

98
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,437
You should open the door now.

99
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,729
I'm sure you know
well as detectives,

100
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,929
but this is not something...

101
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,947
that a mere chef
can do by himself.

102
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,568
Bu Seung Min,
that jerk who will always be a sous chef,

103
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,739
has been in the Blue
House kitchen the longest.

104
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,099
He's the real enemy here.

105
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,638
He's in cahoots with
someone high up...

106
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,539
and is trying to put
all the blame on me.

107
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,879
Right. That's why we're saying
you should come to the station...

108
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:16,067
and tell us your
side of the story.

109
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,249
I was wondering why they were
going through so much trouble...

110
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,718
to make sure that I would quit,

111
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:21,868
but this must be it.

112
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,837
This is something only the
chief secretary or higher can do.

113
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,978
Is it Secretary Han?

114
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,707
What's with the
sudden monologue?

115
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,189
We're pressed for time.

116
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,207
Why do you think?
I'm trying to stall.

117
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,277
We don't have time.

118
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,147
What's this?

119
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,718
Gosh. Mr. Jang Bong
Hwan. Stop right there!

120
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,838
My gosh,
you guys are so impatient.

121
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,479
I'm going to hire an attorney...

122
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,778
and look into that jerk,
Bu Seung Min,

123
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,337
and go to you on my own accord.

124
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,218
You should
eliminate corruption...

125
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,837
and get a promotion,
don't you agree?

126
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,538
Let's stop this. Okay?

127
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,608
Did you hear me? Okay.

128
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,478
You can go home now.

129
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,377
My goodness.

130
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:18,728
Hey!

131
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,979
That crazy dog!

132
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,708
I told you to beware of dogs.

133
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:24,879
Don't come any closer.

134
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,468
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan!
Something bad will happen like this!

135
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,108
My gosh.

136
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,608
Oh, right.

137
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,129
I had an important
question. May I ask it?

138
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,317
What is it?

139
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,662
Why do you give people
sundae gukbap in the holding cell?

140
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,999
What kind of crazy
nonsense is that?

141
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,658
I really hate sundae gukbap.

142
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,539
Do you think this
is a transport cafe?

143
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,558
Is this a rest stop
on a highway?

144
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,838
Why are you complaining
about the menu?

145
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,067
I'm a chef!

146
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:59,049
Even in dangerous times like this,
I only think about cooking.

147
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,197
- I'm the best chef!
- You're really full of it.

148
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,277
Don't let go of me!

149
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,418
My gosh. I almost died.

150
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,358
It's beautiful, isn't it?

151
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:47,848
No.

152
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:51,588
There are so many women
I haven't been with yet.

153
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,738
Help me. I want to live.

154
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,377
I want to live so badly.

155
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:10,627
Is this paradise?

156
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,598
No. I'm going to live.

157
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,407
What's this cloth?

158
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,407
Am I in the morgue alive?

159
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:27,917
Oh, I'm not.

160
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:32,818
That makes sense. There's no
way I would end up in paradise.

161
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,538
I didn't do anything bad,

162
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,002
but I didn't do
anything good either.

163
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,557
What's with this
anachronistic location?

164
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,277
Am I at a hanok village?

165
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:00,377
I fell from such a high place,
so why is my body okay?

166
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,688
That's right. Lower body
exercises can save a man's life.

167
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,958
I'm fine, right? My precious...

168
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,958
What's this? Where
did all my muscles go?

169
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,502
What happened to my precious
babies that I made with the utmost care...

170
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:23,108
Darn it. I heard that when you
lose muscles it turns into fat.

171
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,938
How long have I
been unconscious?

172
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:28,877
What?

173
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:30,978
What's this?

174
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,588
Oh, this must be a dream.

175
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,728
I almost died,
but I'm still dreaming about women.

176
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,027
I'm fine.

177
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:24,408
But I should be dreaming of being
with a woman, not becoming one.

178
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:28,037
Gosh, there's a fine line between
a nightmare and a good dream.

179
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,007
But I saw this woman somewhere.

180
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,738
Did I see her on Instagram?

181
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,608
No. We had a deep
connection with physical contact.

182
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,448
Soo Yeon? Chae Young?

183
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:47,557
The water ghost!

184
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:49,709
Even my voice changed?

185
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,927
Your Highness!

186
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,379
You have finally woken up!

187
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,297
I knew you would wake up.

188
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:58,527
Thank you.

189
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,068
Thank goodness.

190
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:05,548
- Please do not move.
- Why? What is it?

191
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:08,907
You are not well yet, so I...

192
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,698
That's right. This is the kind of
dream I should have. How nice...

193
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,468
What is that? It
tastes horrible.

194
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:35,068
Is it that
uncomfortable to drink?

195
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:38,938
How is my sense of taste
so realistic in a dream?

196
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,673
I will ask them to add some
licorice and make it again.

197
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,647
Is this not a dream?

198
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,318
What on earth is happening?

199
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,088
It is all my fault.

200
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:00,257
I should not have
left your side.

201
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,379
I feel so regretful,

202
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:06,027
so I will not leave your side
for one moment from now on.

203
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,407
Your Highness?

204
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:35,927
Your Highness!

205
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,307
Your Highness!

206
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:49,807
Your Highness!

207
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,677
Your Highness!

208
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,948
Oh, my goodness.

209
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,387
Goodness, Your Highness!

210
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,088
Your Highness!

211
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,188
- Your Highness! - Goodness.

212
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:02,538
- Please stand up. - This is...

213
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,657
Your Highness!

214
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,112
Why are they following?
They're scaring me.

215
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,119
Your Highness! You
must not run like that.

216
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:17,438
Where are you going,
Your Highness?

217
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,819
Your Highness,
where are you going?

218
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:23,258
If you run like that,
it is dangerous... It is dangerous.

219
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,978
My goodness. Your Highness.

220
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,307
Your Highness!

221
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,277
Your Highness!

222
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,647
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

223
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,088
Your Highness!

224
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,588
Your Highness!

225
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,387
Darn it.

226
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:39,739
Wait, Your Highness!

227
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,438
It is not like she is Hong Gil
Dong. When did she get there?

228
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:42,479
Your Highness.

229
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,749
- Your Highness!
- Please do not run!

230
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,167
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

231
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,667
Your Highness!

232
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,738
Is this a palace?

233
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,489
- How weird. Everything is weird.
- Your Highness.

234
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,078
If this isn't a dream,
what is it?

235
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,459
What is all of this?

236
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,188
- Please stop. - Your Highness.

237
00:16:58,212 --> 00:17:00,129
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

238
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,748
- Your Highness! - Oh, my!

239
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,757
What's really strange is that...

240
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,157
I ran like this,
but nothing is bothering me.

241
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,027
It's gone?

242
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,127
Where did mine go?

243
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,568
- How unsightly. - Mine!

244
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,267
Where is it?

245
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,307
What are you looking for?

246
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,959
I will look high and low for it.

247
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,377
Don't come any closer!

248
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,417
I can't believe...

249
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,177
I'm impotent.

250
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:37,699
Your Highness.

251
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,887
If you run like this so suddenly,
something bad will happen!

252
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:45,358
What did you do to me?

253
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,938
In order to preserve your health,
Your Highness,

254
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:51,068
you must first get treated
by the royal physician.

255
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,319
Royal physician or not. If
he shows up in front of me,

256
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,738
I'm going to make
him impotent too!

257
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,637
This doesn't make any sense.

258
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,188
What kind of human trafficker
takes this much care into their job?

259
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:06,748
Why would they abduct a man
and perform surgery on him? Why?

260
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,698
Who hired you?

261
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,317
Is that jerk,
Bu Seung Min's grudge against me that deep?

262
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:14,918
Pardon?

263
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,628
Was it Secretary Han?

264
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:20,079
Is that why you performed
surgery on me like this?

265
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:21,579
If the chief
secretary tells you to,

266
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:25,428
can you change a
person's gender like this?

267
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,547
But why are you
all dressed like that?

268
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:43,347
It's like I've fallen
into a time slip.

269
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,458
What?

270
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,607
What year were you born?

271
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,908
I was born on May 31,
1988. I'm a Gemini.

272
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,918
Where do you live?

273
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,928
31 Sambong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul,

274
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:17,617
Seojeong Parkville,
Apartment number 302.

275
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,117
What are your parent's names?

276
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,539
My father's name is Jang Gil Yeong.
My mother's name is Lee Soo Jin.

277
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,238
One teaches Chinese characters
and the other, Korean history.

278
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:26,269
They're earnest educators,

279
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:28,228
and I'm their mutant,
crazy, jerk of an only son.

280
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,203
What? Do you want me to tell
you how big everything is inside too?

281
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:54,958
Can you tickle me?

282
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:58,857
Like this?

283
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:04,928
So I'm not dreaming.

284
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,698
This feels way too real.

285
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,478
Then, the only explanation is
that my spirit traveled back in time...

286
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,867
and slipped into her body.

287
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,837
I can wake up from dreams.

288
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:17,277
And my spirit can
ditch her body.

289
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,117
You.

290
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,948
Tell me everything you know
about what happened to this woman.

291
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,817
"This woman"?

292
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:27,817
I meant me. Tell me
what happened to me.

293
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,269
It is all my fault.

294
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,027
I did not know that
you left without me.

295
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,797
I deserve to be killed,
Your Highness.

296
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,948
I would do that
if killing you...

297
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:39,567
would solve my problem.

298
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:41,767
But it will not.

299
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,238
Calm down.

300
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,708
Stop crying. There you go.

301
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,547
When and where
did I go all by myself?

302
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,517
Well,

303
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,728
two nights ago,
you said you were tired.

304
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:59,047
So you told me to get the
room ready for sleep early.

305
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:02,688
And I definitely checked
that you were asleep...

306
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,728
before I went back to my work.

307
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,119
Why must we go
on a night patrol...

308
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,738
when this task is
below our status?

309
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:21,988
You only started working
at the palace two years ago.

310
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,577
Does that give you
such a high status?

311
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:25,388
You are the older
brother of His Majesty.

312
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,129
And I,
His Majesty's best friend.

313
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,648
There is a status we hold.

314
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:30,602
You do sound like one
of those royal politicians.

315
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:33,857
Oh, right. Have you heard?

316
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,787
Is it about a woman or a ghost?

317
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,688
Whenever you lower your
voice and get all excited,

318
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,327
it is usually one or the other.

319
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,297
It is about a virgin ghost.

320
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,797
So it is about both.

321
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,738
It is about a water spirit
from the lake over there.

322
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:04,569
They jumped into the
water and rescued you.

323
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,898
The physician took your
pulse and said you were fine.

324
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:08,069
But strangely,

325
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:12,388
you did not wake
up for a whole day.

326
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,057
And then I woke up just now?

327
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:18,797
Yes, it's the water.

328
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,019
This woman and I
both fell into the water.

329
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,797
Our spirits were
switched in the water.

330
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:26,307
Take me to the lake.

331
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:35,918
I said you don't have
to come with me.

332
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,529
I'm just going there
because I can't remember...

333
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:40,168
how I fell into the water.

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,357
Okay?

335
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,027
My gosh. Those darn tails.

336
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,698
I bet they'll stop me from
jumping into the water.

337
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,279
Are you sure we're
on the right path?

338
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,438
It's in the same
palace. Why is it so far?

339
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,867
We are almost there,
Your Highness.

340
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:59,867
The lake behind that
rock is the lake you fell into.

341
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,438
An ambush.

342
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,962
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

343
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,847
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

344
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,388
Your Highness!

345
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:13,087
Your Highness,
you cannot do that!

346
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:15,269
Your Highness!

347
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,287
Please stop!

348
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:19,527
Your Highness!

349
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,827
That is dangerous,
Your Highness!

350
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:29,498
Let's go back. Back to my
life and my precious body.

351
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,238
I'll do good deeds
from time to time.

352
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:35,037
Please, your Almighty,
Buddha, and Virgin Mary.

353
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,448
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

354
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,567
Are you sure you are all right?

355
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,198
Why is there no
water in the lake?

356
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:04,708
Was there a drought
overnight or something?

357
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,859
To prevent the accident
from happening again,

358
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:08,837
the water has been removed,
Your Highness.

359
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,248
You sure took your
time to tell me that.

360
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,398
I apologize, Your Highness.

361
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:14,859
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

362
00:24:14,883 --> 00:24:16,928
My gosh. That darn
"Your Highness".

363
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:18,787
I'm so sick of me that
it's making me vomit.

364
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:21,017
Why are you calling me that?

365
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:24,968
Her Destined Highness is
not feeling well right now.

366
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:27,057
Address her as a young lady.

367
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:28,398
- Yes. - Yes.

368
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,097
"Destined Highness"?
What do you mean?

369
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:36,138
You were selected,
but it is before your wedding.

370
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:38,408
So you are referred to
as Destined Highness.

371
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:41,178
"Selected"?

372
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,329
Then, does it mean...

373
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:47,148
You will become the queen.

374
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:53,757
So are you telling me that I'm
going to be the wife of the king?

375
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:55,817
Yes.

376
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:01,597
My gosh,
I'm going to lose it. Seriously.

377
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,708
- Please forgive us,
- Please forgive us,

378
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,327
- my lady. - my lady.

379
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,218
How could he be so handsome?

380
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:42,549
He is so handsome.

381
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,488
And his fingers
are so delicate too.

382
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:46,468
Goodness.

383
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,238
Your Majesty.

384
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:17,988
Two hours have well passed.

385
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,738
I am worried about your health.

386
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,238
I advise you to
stop here for today.

387
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:24,678
Head Eunuch.

388
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:27,948
As the king,
responsible for the kingdom,

389
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,728
my endeavor to
produce an heir...

390
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,587
must take first priority.

391
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:34,968
I am very tired,
and this task greatly strains me,

392
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:37,428
I cannot stop my studies.

393
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,037
Fine. I'll entertain the idea
that I can travel back in time.

394
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:49,567
But why am I a woman?

395
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:52,408
Not just any woman.
A soon-to-be queen?

396
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,988
I don't believe in marriage.

397
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:56,537
Why must I be the
wife of the king?

398
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,208
Hold on.

399
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,077
If I'm about to be the queen,
does it mean I come from a nice family?

400
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:06,218
Will you be taking a bath right away,
my lady?

401
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,827
Call me Your Highness.
Call me that all day long.

402
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,757
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

403
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:18,567
I am the queen. Am I not?

404
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,948
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

405
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,638
It means that I rule over you.

406
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,812
Gosh, I hated when you call me that,
but it's music to my ears now.

407
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,037
Listen.

408
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,059
Fill the lake with
water right now.

409
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,277
It's an order.

410
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:36,378
Why didn't I think of
such an easy solution?

411
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:40,347
We cannot do that,
Your Highness.

412
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:42,988
What?

413
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:44,509
Gosh.

414
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:48,357
You will come to your senses
when I go on a power trip.

415
00:27:57,272 --> 00:27:58,867
Please spare me, Your Highness.

416
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,109
I deserve death.

417
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,558
No, but still. Please spare me!

418
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:09,017
What? Why is she overreacting?

419
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,664
She is finally awake.

420
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,156
Seeing how she is
torturing her court ladies,

421
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,475
she must have
made a full recovery.

422
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,545
Bring her here.

423
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:24,545
Yes, Your Majesty.

424
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,455
Your Highness, His Majesty
wishes to see you at the pavilion.

425
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,795
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

426
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,265
"Your Majesty"?

427
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:51,005
The boss in this area.

428
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,634
She has boundless
energy as expected.

429
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,545
Gosh, Your Majesty.

430
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,644
What on earth happened?

431
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,436
- That's not important now.
- That is not important?

432
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,465
You should always dress
properly and keep peace of mind.

433
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,805
I get it,
but it's urgent for me.

434
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,164
A scholar...

435
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:47,576
should wake with the sound of a
rooster announcing the morning,

436
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,634
dress properly,
and should not love...

437
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,775
Should not lose...

438
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,074
Should not lose his conscience
and nurture his good nature.

439
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:02,074
Save the philosophy for
later. This is an urgent matter.

440
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,295
I need water so bad right now.

441
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,735
Head Eunuch. Bring
some cold water right away.

442
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,265
No,
no. What I'm talking about...

443
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,955
is water in the lake.

444
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,525
The lake is all drained now.

445
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,705
It means...

446
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,324
you want me to fill the
lake with water right away.

447
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,265
That's right.

448
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,465
I cannot do that.

449
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,205
- Why not?
- Grand Queen Dowager ordered it.

450
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:32,975
If I fill the lake with water,
it means I will be crossing her.

451
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,114
Aren't you the king?

452
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,245
What kind of king can't
even fill a lake with water?

453
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,566
I must be considerate of
the Grand Queen Dowager...

454
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,124
who was shocked and
worried about the accident.

455
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,624
I also think it is the right
thing to keep the lake drained.

456
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:56,765
Why is it the right thing?

457
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,904
Explain it logically.

458
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,616
Just because.

459
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,275
Is he kidding me?

460
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,235
How dare you put
your hand on me?

461
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,896
It seems like you see
yourself as quite the scholar.

462
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,406
Isn't it impolite to keep
plugging your nose...

463
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,924
in front of someone?

464
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,235
I am glad to see you are well.

465
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,235
I worried a lot.

466
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:34,674
Yes. I can feel the sincerity.

467
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,805
But did you always
talk like this?

468
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,215
After having a near-death experience,
I have so much anger.

469
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,975
How on earth did
you fall into the lake?

470
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:49,285
She does not have a
memory of that exact moment.

471
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:52,185
Just that exact moment?

472
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,884
How strange.

473
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,035
You're reading the "Four
Books and the Three Classics".

474
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,324
"Changes of Zhou"
is the best one.

475
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,435
I do not like it when
others touch my books.

476
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,805
My gosh. I already touched it.

477
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,426
It already got dirty.
Let me just see it.

478
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,545
Come now. They say the
wife should follow her teacher.

479
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,340
You mean the wife
should follow her husband.

480
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,995
That is what I said.

481
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,035
- You said "teacher".
- Come now!

482
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,005
Yin should not go against yang,

483
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,324
and the wife should
obey her husband!

484
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,894
Is this the Joseon
dynasty or what?

485
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,295
It is.

486
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,495
You must think you're
a king or something.

487
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,064
I am the king.

488
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:41,874
My goodness.

489
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,305
How obnoxious.

490
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:52,185
Let go.

491
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,384
Come now.

492
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,525
Come now. Why
are you doing this?

493
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,824
Something feels off.

494
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,265
Your Majesty!

495
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,564
It is time to attend
the royal conference.

496
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,305
Is it that time already?

497
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:17,555
A day of a king
who rules a country...

498
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,725
feels like one must
forever flutter one's wings...

499
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,945
Okay. You're busy.
Please excuse me.

500
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,126
Head Eunuch!

501
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,045
Yes, Your Majesty!

502
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,464
Head Eunuch.

503
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,774
You know how
much I cherish books.

504
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,856
I am getting
slower with old age.

505
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,274
My hand slipped, Your Majesty.

506
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:32,844
That book costs three times
as much as your monthly wage.

507
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,285
I deserve to be killed!

508
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,725
No, you do not.

509
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,276
No matter how
valuable a book is,

510
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,964
it cannot be compared
to the value of your life.

511
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,765
Thank you for your boundless generosity,
Your Majesty.

512
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,705
Your passion for learning
is as great as mine.

513
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,504
I will have them prepare
new books for you.

514
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,315
I have a royal conference, so...

515
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,114
Hear me.

516
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,855
Bring my palanquin.

517
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,995
Let me ride with you. This
place is bigger than I thought.

518
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,094
No, I do not want to. It is
too small for two people.

519
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,665
And you should wash up,
Destined Highness.

520
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,875
Go.

521
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,355
What? That rude jerk.

522
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,234
Your Highness,
you cannot sit on the ground.

523
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:59,364
My back hurts.

524
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,415
Memory loss, it is.

525
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:21,355
It is not just a
simple memory loss.

526
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,106
The illness of her mind became
more severe before the important event.

527
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,745
She is under the delusion
that she is another person...

528
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,134
to escape from reality...

529
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,565
The Grand Queen Dowager
and I are the only people here.

530
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,864
If I ever hear what you just
said uttered from another mouth...

531
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,875
It will never happen.

532
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,274
You must find a way to
cure the Destined Highness.

533
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,145
Yes, I will.

534
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,044
How can we make a girl who does not
even know her own name the queen?

535
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,425
We can tell her what her name is
and make her regain her memory.

536
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,145
Do not worry.

537
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,855
Would you like to
see her in person?

538
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,666
There are so many
eyes watching us.

539
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,736
We do not need to show them...

540
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,606
a girl who cannot even
recognize the elders of the family.

541
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,794
I will resolve it with as
few people as possible.

542
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,075
But why did the
Destined Highness...

543
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:11,665
go out by herself
so late at night?

544
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,065
Someone...

545
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,605
must have lured her,
pretending to pass the word of the king.

546
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,145
It is hard to ask a question
if it is the king's order.

547
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,714
But who?

548
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,085
She is awake?

549
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,165
Really?

550
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,234
I believe my
talisman has worked.

551
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:48,174
That shaman is good indeed.

552
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,515
Bring me interesting
news when you can.

553
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,085
This is something people
love to gossip about.

554
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:02,066
The woman selected to be...

555
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,415
the Royal Concubine pushed
the Destined Queen to the lake?

556
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,984
She will not be the
Royal Concubine.

557
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,006
Was her name Jo Hwa Jin?

558
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,154
Yes.

559
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,134
I needed an excuse.
It all worked out...

560
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,716
although the Pungyang Jo clan
has already declined in power.

561
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,504
One must be careful...

562
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:23,035
even with a dying fire.

563
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,186
Regarding the abolition of
the policy for public service,

564
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,396
the conservative and progressive
parties are split in opinion.

565
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,884
And I would like to report this to you,
Your Majesty.

566
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,815
In my opinion,

567
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,484
the progressive party...

568
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,754
The conservative...

569
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,625
What should I do with this?

570
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,615
The progressive party...

571
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,716
demands to abolish
the public service policy,

572
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,086
but that will lead to
enormous financial damage.

573
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,285
I advise you to follow the
conservative party's idea...

574
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:01,875
to gradually reduce the policy.

575
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,444
That is exactly what I meant.

576
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,865
The next agenda is
the most urgent matter.

577
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:12,585
It regards the royal marriage.

578
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,125
I doubt that you know that...

579
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,895
the Destined Queen
is finally awake.

580
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,446
Your Majesty,

581
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,816
there are rumors
within the palace...

582
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,605
that she is not herself
after waking up.

583
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:28,435
Is that so?

584
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,234
It is my first time
to hear about it.

585
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,986
I only found out that
she was awake...

586
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,875
because I ran
into her by chance.

587
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,815
Am I the only one to
get the news so late?

588
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,754
It is only a rumor.

589
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,265
We did not want to worry you,

590
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:49,294
so we decided not
to bring it up to you.

591
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,936
How thoughtful.

592
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,225
I do not believe...

593
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,565
it is just a rumor.

594
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,486
Upon seeing her,

595
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,705
she did seem a bit
different from the other times.

596
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,975
She said she cannot remember
how she fell into the lake.

597
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:09,315
She must have lost her
memories due to the shock.

598
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,526
That must mean the danger
she faced was serious.

599
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,595
"Danger"?

600
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:15,035
I do not believe her
falling into the lake...

601
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,154
was a simple accident.

602
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,236
What?

603
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,405
Around the time of her fall,

604
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,475
there is a eunuch who
saw a suspicious woman...

605
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:24,975
when he was passing by the lake.

606
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,464
- A suspicious woman? - What?

607
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,404
Who was that woman?

608
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,155
Upon checking the visitors' log,

609
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:45,515
there was only one woman who
entered the palace at that time.

610
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,455
It was Royal Secretariat
Jo Dae Su's daughter,

611
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,254
Jo Hwa Jin.

612
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,895
How dare you frame her?

613
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,265
She has no reason to
harm the Destined Queen.

614
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,565
She is selected to be
the Royal Concubine.

615
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:05,899
She must have wanted
to be the queen herself,

616
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:08,975
and harmed the Destined Queen.

617
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,605
She is being framed when she is innocent,
Your Majesty.

618
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:17,126
Jo Dae Su is well-known for
his transparency and loyalty.

619
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,984
And his daughter...

620
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:22,336
is well-known for
her noble character.

621
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,915
This is treason.

622
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,666
How dare you?

623
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,135
Why did Jo Hwa Jin
secretly enter the palace?

624
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:31,175
Did she not meet with
Queen Dowager Jo?

625
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,125
What is the accusation
you are making here?

626
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,716
You will face the
wrath of the universe!

627
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,864
Your Majesty.

628
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,335
You must get to the bottom of
this incident and find the truth.

629
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,274
Do punish the culprit severely.

630
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,625
My apologies.

631
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:11,964
This has put me in a tight spot.

632
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:14,875
Jo Hwa Jin...

633
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,745
was with me for the whole night.

634
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,745
- What is this about? - What?

635
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,026
Pardon?

636
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,296
Of course. As the wedding
has not taken place yet,

637
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,160
I have not declared her
as the Royal Concubine.

638
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,654
But you see, I am a young,
healthy man.

639
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,975
But I am sure you
already knew that.

640
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:38,055
You hear the news
faster than I do.

641
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,845
Now that it is out in the open,

642
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,575
we must expedite the marriage,

643
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,805
so I can select my
concubine. What do you think?

644
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,146
That is...

645
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,845
As for the truth
of the incident,

646
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:50,686
as soon as the Destined Queen remembers,
it will be resolved.

647
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,044
Let us not jump
to conclusions yet.

648
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:55,526
I cannot have my people,
attack each other.

649
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,574
We will not get any work
done if this continues.

650
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,884
Do you not agree?

651
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,405
If the wedding takes place,

652
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:12,895
the Kims will rule the palace.

653
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,845
Seeing how His Majesty
cherishes Jo Hwa Jin,

654
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,935
I am sure we will have
our chance to fight back.

655
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,574
The future of the
Pungyang Jo clan...

656
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,904
depends on Jo Hwa Jin.

657
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,674
First, we must make sure she
becomes the Royal Concubine...

658
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:32,585
and plan our future.

659
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,614
The wedding will
take place as planned.

660
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:38,725
But why do you look so sad?

661
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,355
This fight will be a hassle.

662
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:01,044
As I am lacking,

663
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,995
it forces me to rely
on your help too much.

664
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:06,484
- I apologize.
- I did not do much.

665
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:12,055
You are getting better
at handling the court.

666
00:45:13,729 --> 00:45:15,324
You are too kind.

667
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,436
I am barely managing...

668
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,565
with your help.

669
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:24,134
By the way,
I have failed to consider your vigor.

670
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,004
My apologies.

671
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,935
No,
let me apologize for overlooking that.

672
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,126
However,
balance is very important...

673
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,174
in treating women.

674
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,085
The Internal Court takes up
a part of the palace as well.

675
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,015
I urge you to remember...

676
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,384
that the queen is more
important than the royal concubine.

677
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,055
I will keep it in mind.

678
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:50,836
And I will find out the identity
of the suspicious woman...

679
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,165
the eunuch saw that night.

680
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,035
I must make sure she never
finds herself in such danger.

681
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,904
Yes.

682
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,134
You are right indeed.

683
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,705
I apologize, my lady.

684
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,134
Oh,
no. It took you so long to write that.

685
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:57,794
I have written this
poem with you now.

686
00:46:58,269 --> 00:46:59,995
It is more beautiful
thanks to you.

687
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,134
Goodness, my lady.

688
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:05,716
My lady.

689
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,705
You have received an
order from the palace.

690
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,214
Accept the order
from His Majesty.

691
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,135
Royal Secretariat Jo Dae Su's daughter,
Jo Hwa Jin,

692
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,966
will undergo the selection
process of the Royal Concubine...

693
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,635
right after His Majesty's
wedding tomorrow.

694
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:29,125
Come to the palace now.

695
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:38,335
This hits the spot.

696
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,435
We need more cold water.

697
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:47,205
We will add more water.

698
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:50,774
Keep pouring.

699
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,544
Yes, water.

700
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,585
That's the problem.

701
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,455
Wouldn't I be able to go back
even if it's in a different spot?

702
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,024
I fell into the swimming pool,
after all.

703
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:04,475
Is there another lake nearby?

704
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:07,294
There are two more
lakes just in this palace.

705
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,335
- Really? - Yes.

706
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,190
But the other lakes are not much
different from the one you saw.

707
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,074
What do you mean?

708
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,375
It is an order from
Grand Queen Dowager.

709
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,504
She instructed to remove the
water in every lake at the palace.

710
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,844
Every single lake?

711
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,515
Yes, Your Highness.

712
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,245
Until when?

713
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,984
Forever, Your Highness.

714
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,154
Then that means...

715
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:37,225
I have to live like this?

716
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:39,924
Forever?

717
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:44,864
Your Highness!

718
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:53,245
Water. I must try it out with
whatever water I can find.

719
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,915
I want to go back!

720
00:48:58,949 --> 00:48:59,966
Your Highness!

721
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,145
Your Highness!

722
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:03,936
Your Highness!

723
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,524
- Your Highness!
- It is dirty water! Your Highness!

724
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,924
Your Highness!

725
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,924
You must not do this!

726
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,995
Your Highness!

727
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,205
I can't move.

728
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:24,274
- Lower your bottoms!
- Yes, ma'am.

729
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:28,325
- Your Highness! Take out your head!
- Your Highness!

730
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,574
You must not do this!

731
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,484
I was right. It won't
work unless it's that lake.

732
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,194
How shocked must you be...

733
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,794
to change every
time you see water?

734
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:03,915
You're cute. What's
your name again?

735
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,614
Hong Yeon. It's Hong Yeon.

736
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,955
If you have forgotten me,
who took care of you since you were born,

737
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:16,254
how ill are you?

738
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,835
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart.

739
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,774
I am bringing in your medicine.

740
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,174
How dare you shed
tears in front of her?

741
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,400
The person who is suffering
the most is Her Highness.

742
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,685
I apologize.

743
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,055
That's right. I'm
suffering the most.

744
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,384
The two of you will
never understand...

745
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,855
the sense of loss I'm feeling.

746
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,234
Go collect yourself
and come back.

747
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,234
I won't be able
to go back quickly,

748
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:07,344
so if I want to endure my time here,
I need information.

749
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,074
I have a question.

750
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,960
What's the name of that jerk with
the bad personality I met earlier?

751
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,114
What's the name of the king?

752
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,555
How can I dare speak the
sacred name of the king?

753
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:21,955
Oh, right.

754
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,539
You're not allowed to call the
king by his name or speak of it.

755
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,905
What year of the Joseon
Dynasty are we in right now?

756
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:29,364
It is 1851.

757
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,134
It is the second year since Prince
Deokwan assumed the throne.

758
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,186
Prince Deokwan.

759
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,004
I'm sure I've heard
his name before.

760
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:39,944
Give me some more hints.

761
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:43,475
Hints?

762
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:47,995
Right. Then I'll sing a song.

763
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,166
Give me a sign if the preceding
king's temple name comes up.

764
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,355
Listen carefully.

765
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,936
Tae, Jeong, Tae,
Se, Mun, Dan, Se

766
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,324
Ye, Seong, Yeon,
Jung, In, Myeong, Seon

767
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,864
It hasn't come up yet? Okay,
so he's a later king.

768
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,615
Gwang, In, Hyo, Hyeon,
Suk, Gyeong, Yeon,

769
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,535
Jeong, Sun, Heon, Cheol, Go

770
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,335
Go?

771
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:16,114
Go, Cheol, Heon, Sun...

772
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,844
Sun, Heon...

773
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:24,754
Why is there a fly in here?

774
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,955
If he's the king
after Heonjong...

775
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,665
Cheoljong?

776
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:38,716
Cheoljong. Born Lee Won Beom.

777
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,946
When he became king,
he changed his name to Yi Byeon.

778
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,655
His entire family was
caught up in treason,

779
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:44,115
and they were exiled
to Ganghwa Island.

780
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:48,205
He is a Cinderella man, who became
king overnight because he was dumb.

781
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,256
He lived as the most ignorant
and incompetent puppet king,

782
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,145
and he made the people suffer.

783
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,520
Then he died in his 13th
year of reign due to a disease.

784
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,135
Gosh,
this is the importance of early education.

785
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:01,384
My mom is the best!

786
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:06,006
They say those who come
into sudden wealth are scary,

787
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,864
but he suddenly became king,
yet he tries hard to act the part.

788
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,864
I was heartless to you earlier
as I did not know your state.

789
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:17,475
Let me see.

790
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:20,504
What are you doing?

791
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,245
You do not need to be shy.

792
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:28,245
Come tomorrow you
and I will be married.

793
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,484
Tomorrow?

794
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,705
I told them to hurry up
and hold our wedding,

795
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:37,824
which was postponed
due to your accident.

796
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,895
Our wedding is tomorrow.

797
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:45,835
Oh, my god. I forgot about
the most important thing.

798
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,115
Cheoljong was negligent
in running the country...

799
00:53:47,139 --> 00:53:48,979
because he was obsessed
with women and alcohol.

800
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,935
He's Joseon's
representative sex maniac.

801
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,375
Hold on.

802
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,344
There's something
you must know first.

803
00:54:09,677 --> 00:54:13,413
I did as you wanted and told
everyone to keep their distance.

804
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:14,913
Are you satisfied?

805
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,882
So I know this
is hard to believe,

806
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,453
but I don't know
how to explain this.

807
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,252
This is difficult.

808
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:27,723
- There is something here.
- What? What is it?

809
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,632
It is a flower petal.

810
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:37,703
You might be shocked,

811
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,502
but try to accept it
as best as you can.

812
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:45,343
- To be honest,
- To be honest...

813
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:49,852
I'm a man.

814
00:54:57,557 --> 00:54:59,104
I'm a healthy man...

815
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:01,062
who lives in Korea,
about 200 years from now.

816
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:03,213
I don't know how this happened.

817
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:05,073
I thought I was dead
after falling into the water,

818
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:06,544
but when I woke up,
I looked like this.

819
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:09,854
In any case,
I'm not the person you think I am.

820
00:55:09,878 --> 00:55:11,533
What you see isn't everything.

821
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:16,593
You must be wondering
what kind of nonsense this is.

822
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:19,193
But you must make
the right decision.

823
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:21,913
Let's say that we get married,
but our first night...

824
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:24,082
That's really wrong.

825
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:27,152
I don't like men.

826
00:55:28,427 --> 00:55:30,733
This is a bigger
problem for you.

827
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:32,374
For me,
this is an issue about identity.

828
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:35,732
But for you,
this is marriage fraud. It's a crime.

829
00:55:39,407 --> 00:55:42,573
I understand what
you are saying.

830
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,873
Really? You are...

831
00:55:47,048 --> 00:55:49,873
a lot better than what
I've read in history books.

832
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,712
Look here!

833
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,463
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

834
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:56,363
Go tell the royal physician...

835
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,982
to identify the Destined Highness'
exact condition and inform me.

836
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:00,922
What?

837
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,393
Yes, Your Majesty.

838
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:06,303
Do not worry.

839
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:09,832
I will do everything I can
do to help you get better.

840
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:13,433
Do not forget.
You are not alone.

841
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:17,303
Regardless of how badly you
lose your mind and become mad,

842
00:56:18,978 --> 00:56:21,373
I will forever be your husband.

843
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:28,913
Oh,
my. You must still be unwell.

844
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,082
Look here.

845
00:56:30,717 --> 00:56:33,164
Hurry up and bring
her back to her room.

846
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:34,763
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

847
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:36,204
Do not worry.

848
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:39,163
Go in and get some
rest. You will be okay.

849
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,433
Everything will be okay.

850
00:56:43,998 --> 00:56:45,332
It is okay.

851
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,863
It will be okay.

852
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,703
Books never lie.

853
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:53,724
He might be dumber than
portrayed in history books.

854
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,143
Get plenty of rest.

855
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,812
Oh, okay. I get it.

856
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,712
Your Highness,
you must not walk with your skirt raised.

857
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,783
You must not show
the inside as you walk.

858
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,553
Your Highness,
you must walk slowly. You must not do this.

859
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:14,993
What is her hidden agenda?

860
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,383
No. I won't eat it.

861
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:21,902
Western medicine works better
for me than oriental medicine.

862
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:25,902
Please, open up.

863
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,073
No.

864
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,772
Open up.

865
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:31,812
Goodness.

866
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:39,582
I told you...

867
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,954
The energy of water
is filling her head.

868
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:02,143
I should fill it with the energy
of fire using sandalwood.

869
00:58:03,018 --> 00:58:05,513
Your Highness,
you must get your memory back.

870
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,564
You quack! You don't have a license,
do you?

871
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:11,913
Why are you smoking a person?

872
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:23,073
I will unblock the thirteenth
point of energy and blood...

873
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:24,192
that treats mental illness.

874
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:26,713
Okay. Do whatever you want.

875
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:28,402
It's not my body anyway.

876
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:43,913
I remember!

877
00:58:46,128 --> 00:58:47,823
I remember
everything like magic.

878
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:49,803
Hong Yeon.

879
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,823
My precious maid who grew
up with me in my parent's house.

880
00:58:57,637 --> 00:59:01,303
What is this person's surname?

881
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,902
You are...

882
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,203
Cho...

883
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:10,373
Choi! Court Lady Choi.

884
00:59:13,088 --> 00:59:16,752
Then what is my surname?

885
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:24,533
How would I know the surname
of a mere royal physician?

886
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:25,903
What are you all doing?

887
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:27,204
Hurry and hold Your Highness.

888
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:29,192
It will only make things
worse if she moves.

889
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:33,084
How can you use that
meat skewer on a person?

890
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:34,343
Are you crazy?

891
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,672
My main expertise
is acupuncture.

892
00:59:36,737 --> 00:59:37,983
Nothing is better than this...

893
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,323
to unclog the flow of blood.

894
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:41,772
- I will put this in the nape of...
- Stop! Stop it!

895
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:43,373
Please stop.

896
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:45,373
If I come back to my senses,

897
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:48,582
I'll be the queen
starting tomorrow.

898
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:53,022
What price will you pay...

899
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,123
for overtreatment?

900
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,774
Too much is
worse than too little.

901
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,962
I will finish my brilliant
medical performance here.

902
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,873
Yes, you're an amazing
physician. I'm fully recovered now.

903
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,902
I'm all good. I am.

904
01:00:15,548 --> 01:00:18,473
Fine. I'll become the queen
as you guys want it so badly.

905
01:00:18,878 --> 01:00:20,882
I'll be the queen of a country.

906
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,413
Filling a lake with water should be easy,
right?

907
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:48,743
Have you risen, Your Highness?

908
01:01:22,818 --> 01:01:23,973
Come in.

909
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,823
I have to wear all this?

910
01:01:43,338 --> 01:01:45,744
(Royal ceremonial garment)

911
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,343
Undergarment, bloomer shorts,

912
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:49,254
loose pants, underskirt,

913
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:51,113
breast cover, undershirt,

914
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:53,084
single skirt, double skirt,

915
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:55,224
triple skirt,
samhoejang jeogori,

916
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:57,743
and dangui.

917
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:01,124
The upper garment
is slim and tight-fitting,

918
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,193
and the lower garment is puffy.

919
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:06,033
It is to create the
perfect voluptuous figure.

920
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:08,852
(Small upper body
and big lower body)

921
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:13,163
I can't breathe.

922
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:44,953
Pendants of jade
beads cover the eyes,

923
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:48,192
and sapphire beads
cover the ears.

924
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,414
This signifies the king should
cover his own eyes and ears...

925
01:02:50,438 --> 01:02:52,692
and listen to his court.

926
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,473
Straighten your neck.

927
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:00,983
It's darn heavy.

928
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:03,643
You should bear that
suffocating weight.

929
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,493
I'm the first woman in
Joseon to not wear a bra.

930
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:03,772
Bow to one another.

931
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,712
- Your Highness.
- What do you want me to do?

932
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:50,193
We are not performing
an ancestral rite.

933
01:04:50,217 --> 01:04:52,652
A wedding is
basically a funeral.

934
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,733
How many times should I bow?

935
01:04:58,757 --> 01:05:00,223
Two more.

936
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:13,073
They are such a
beautiful couple.

937
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:17,653
Is it not all your work,
Grand Queen Dowager?

938
01:05:17,677 --> 01:05:20,243
Thank you for recognizing it,
Queen Dowager.

939
01:05:25,257 --> 01:05:28,022
Raise your glasses.

940
01:05:59,787 --> 01:06:01,783
Why... Cousin.

941
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,223
Are you crying?

942
01:06:07,427 --> 01:06:10,292
I am happy that she has
become the queen of this kingdom,

943
01:06:11,537 --> 01:06:12,792
but...

944
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:16,402
I feel like I am losing
my only daughter.

945
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:19,033
My goodness.

946
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:22,502
You are now the queen's father.

947
01:06:23,048 --> 01:06:25,672
Great Lord Yeongeun.

948
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:26,982
Is that so?

949
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:29,243
Right.

950
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,893
I announce that Kim So
Yong of the Andong Kim clan...

951
01:06:39,057 --> 01:06:41,962
became the queen of Joseon.

952
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:44,613
That's the first time I'm
hearing this woman's name.

953
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:46,703
You should love me.

954
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:07,922
I can't... I can't breathe.

955
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,893
A heart attack?

956
01:07:33,288 --> 01:07:35,243
Pay your respects!

957
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:40,283
- Long live the King and Queen!
- Long live the King and Queen!

958
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:49,463
There is no eternal enemy
and no eternal ally in the palace.

959
01:07:49,637 --> 01:07:53,703
Always keep your balance and empty
your heart so you do not get swayed.

960
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:55,744
Do not worry.

961
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:57,183
I am going to the palace...

962
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,743
only because I want to be
of little help to His Majesty.

963
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:01,102
My goodness.

964
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:08,523
Nanny, I am not going to die.

965
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,213
Do not cry like that.

966
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:14,052
You are too kind, my lady.

967
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:18,123
I do not know how you would
be able to survive in the palace.

968
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:22,163
I will serve her
faithfully. Do not worry.

969
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,463
I surrender. I surrender!

970
01:09:38,377 --> 01:09:40,602
I thought we would be
reciting poems at a pavilion.

971
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,743
You should have said it is
a training session, not a trip!

972
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:45,153
Is it not nice?

973
01:09:45,177 --> 01:09:47,094
To sweat like this before
this magnificent view.

974
01:09:47,118 --> 01:09:48,363
Nice?

975
01:09:48,387 --> 01:09:50,733
I am already dying because I have
to practice martial arts every day,

976
01:09:50,757 --> 01:09:53,403
which I do not even like,
because of my father, the Minister of War.

977
01:09:53,427 --> 01:09:55,222
What are we doing here?

978
01:09:55,328 --> 01:09:57,753
If I knew,
I would have never followed you.

979
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:03,092
Someone might think you
have an archenemy somewhere.

980
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:05,244
Why are you so mad
over the joyous occasion...

981
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,633
of your cousin
becoming the queen.

982
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,232
I am so happy that I do not
know how to contain this energy.

983
01:10:13,578 --> 01:10:16,613
If you do not like swordsmanship,
how about a hand-to-hand fight?

984
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:20,213
I changed my mind. I
am going back right now.

985
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:25,713
Go back after beating me.

986
01:10:30,028 --> 01:10:32,753
Quickly, quickly. I think
it is digging into my neck.

987
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:36,463
I thought I was dying.

988
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:39,692
A modern "studio photoshoot, dress,
and makeup" session is nothing.

989
01:10:53,318 --> 01:10:56,083
The room has been upgraded.

990
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:57,783
This is Daejojeon Hall.

991
01:10:58,757 --> 01:11:01,323
It is as big as the name.

992
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:04,592
It means you should
make a big contribution.

993
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:07,293
Do they want me to
save the country or what?

994
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:08,863
It means you should bear...

995
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:11,863
royal offspring.

996
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,902
Right. There's
the wedding night.

997
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:24,772
It's the biggest crisis of Jang
Bong Hwan's 33 years of life.

998
01:11:39,997 --> 01:11:42,793
There's always a way
out of every situation.

999
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:48,003
There must be a way.

1000
01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:50,333
Your liquor table is here.

1001
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,753
Yes. It's the liquor.

1002
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:08,982
Ancestors, you sure are wise.

1003
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,852
Let me pour you a drink.

1004
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:41,083
What liquor would
His Majesty like?

1005
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:43,722
I enjoy the accompaniment
more than the liquor.

1006
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,323
Why you...

1007
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:49,793
It's a special day. Don't eat
the food too much and drink.

1008
01:12:50,438 --> 01:12:52,892
Overdrinking harms your body.

1009
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:54,703
Why you little...

1010
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,833
Let's not get mad and calm down.

1011
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:01,203
There's no Korean who isn't
proud of how much they can drink.

1012
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:05,023
I see. You can't drink.

1013
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,442
I can tell you can't take
as much alcohol as I can.

1014
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:08,863
That is great.

1015
01:13:08,887 --> 01:13:11,312
All the liquor here is yours.

1016
01:13:12,057 --> 01:13:14,753
Is he wearing a
bulletproof vest or what?

1017
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:17,233
No attack gets through to him.

1018
01:13:17,257 --> 01:13:19,423
Okay. Do you want to
play a drinking game then?

1019
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:22,623
I know some games you
can play when drinking.

1020
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:24,633
You do?

1021
01:13:25,038 --> 01:13:27,014
3, 6, 9, 3, 6, 9,

1022
01:13:27,038 --> 01:13:28,863
3, 6, 9, 3, 6, 9.

1023
01:13:31,837 --> 01:13:33,823
When was the multiplication
table introduced in Korea?

1024
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:36,124
You don't know? Then,

1025
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:39,393
roll book, roll book, roll book,

1026
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,964
roll book, roll book.

1027
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:44,964
I guess the word "shame"
was made for this situation.

1028
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,283
Hey, why aren't you doing it?

1029
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,783
How do I do it?

1030
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:50,253
I was excited because
you said it is a game,

1031
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:53,762
but you are just shouting
"roll book". It is no fun.

1032
01:13:54,467 --> 01:13:56,022
How picky.

1033
01:13:57,337 --> 01:14:00,262
You indeed need music
and dance when drinking.

1034
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:07,584
Until when should I dance
to royal ancestral rite music?

1035
01:14:07,608 --> 01:14:08,754
Look at my shoulders

1036
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,424
They're moving up and down

1037
01:14:10,448 --> 01:14:11,754
The drink is going down

1038
01:14:11,778 --> 01:14:14,063
Down, down, down

1039
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:15,264
It keeps going down

1040
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,265
Down, down, down

1041
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:17,753
Are you that excited?

1042
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:25,222
Did "royal ancestral
rite music" work?

1043
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,092
Then shall we?

1044
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:42,503
No, I didn't mean that!

1045
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:57,052
I can't help but
take the last step.

1046
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:23,552
(Mr. Queen)

1047
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:42,283
What does it feel like to
greet the first day as Queen?

1048
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:43,454
- It feels like poop. - Oh, my.

1049
01:15:43,478 --> 01:15:46,454
What we are preparing for is a
fight for power and justification.

1050
01:15:46,478 --> 01:15:49,523
The only way for us to
punish those in power...

1051
01:15:49,547 --> 01:15:52,254
is to prove their corruption with
documents with clear evidence.

1052
01:15:52,278 --> 01:15:53,624
Now that I have
seen her in person,

1053
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:56,323
I could see that the queen
is not back to her full senses.

1054
01:15:56,347 --> 01:15:58,594
But for us,
who she should be is more important...

1055
01:15:58,618 --> 01:16:01,453
than who she is.
