00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,690
Why don't you cook for me?

3
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,580
Even though I've come to see you many times.

4
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,830
You never welcome me like...

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,000
you welcome him.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Someone like you

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,060
doesn't need to eat food,

8
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,270
you'd rather eat my feet!

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,030
Shhh.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,760
We have been together for...

11
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,220
66 years.

12
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,150
You just give me your feet?

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,670
I'd rather eat you whole.

14
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,670
Take good care of your people.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,390
Hey!

16
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,750
It's tomorrow...

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,580
Hey!

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,350
Hey, what's going on!?

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,630
Can you hear me?

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,850
Hey, please open the door!

21
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,470
Hey!

22
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,370
Thanu.

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,980
Thanu, can you hear me?

24
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,970
Thanu!

25
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,120
Wake up!

26
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,070
Thanu!

27
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,980
Damn. Wake up, Thanu!

28
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,110
Thanu!

29
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,200
Wake up!

30
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,550
Thanu.

31
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,510
Can you hear me?

32
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
Wake up, Thanu!

33
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,260
Thanu!

34
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,630
Lie down properly.

35
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,230
You are safe now.

36
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,660
Thanu.

37
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,390
Who did this to you?

38
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,400
Thanu!

39
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,050
I don't know what happened to me.

40
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,460
But if I survive,

41
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,180
I'll find a way to get your body out of here!

42
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,520
I promise!

43
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,270
Where are you?

44
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,650
Come out!

45
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,710
What do you want?

46
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,510
I told you

47
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,410
to take good care of him.

48
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,750
I won't even let you

49
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,020
touch his hand.

50
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,030
Let me ask you,

51
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,570
what do you want?

52
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,940
Your life is mine!

53
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,330
Remember this!

54
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,220
Why do you have to hurt my friend?

55
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,980
Friend?

56
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,130
Take it easy.

57
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,730
Are you sure he is your friend?

58
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,030
Even though his appearance is similar to your friend named...

59
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,930
What's his name again?

60
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,990
Oh.

61
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,250
Thanu.

62
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,660
But don't forget

63
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,200
how many lifetimes have passed.

64
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,450
Hasn't he been reborn twice already?

65
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,540
He became a stranger.

66
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,270
He doesn't know you anymore.

67
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,680
He doesn't know Chai Khun anymore.

68
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,040
But you have no right to kill anyone like this!

69
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,750
You have no right to stop me either!

70
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Don't forget

71
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,590
you owe me.

72
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,870
Don't you remember

73
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,470
who made you immortal?

74
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,410
But if you forget,

75
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,710
I'll remind you.

76
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,140
Are you sure?

77
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,820
Your wish will come true.

78
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,220
You will survive

79
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,950
forever.

80
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,230
So funny, right?

81
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,770
You dodged prison more times than I can count,

82
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,290
but now you're stuck with me forever.

83
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,870
Don't even think about escaping from here.

84
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,250
Tonight's just a warning,

85
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,620
Tomorrow, I finish this.

86
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,030
Don't you remember

87
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,450
who made you immortal?

88
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,710
No!

89
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,630
Don't do this to me!

90
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,630
Let me go!

91
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,910
Don't!

92
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,440
Don't!

93
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,760
Don't go.

94
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,340
What happened

95
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
just now?

96
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,460
Nothing.

97
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,310
You're just dreaming.

98
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm scared.

99
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,840
Hey.

100
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,460
You're feverish.

101
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,580
Are you okay?

102
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,600
Just take a rest.

103
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,820
Are you feeling better yet?

104
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,010
Yes.

105
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,700
Thank you so much.

106
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,470
But...

107
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,920
The dream just now

108
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,110
was so realistic.

109
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,100
You woke up so early.

110
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,310
I have to prepare breakfast for a special guest.

111
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,340
Who?

112
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,510
The guest in the room next door.

113
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,700
Okay.

114
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,300
Aero~

115
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,300
Have breakfast first.

116
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,070
Does it look delicious?

117
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,810
It looks so delicious.

118
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,660
Can I have some coffee too?

119
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,050
Sure.

120
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,410
I'll make you some coffee.

121
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,160
Hey.

122
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,660
Hey!

123
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,260
Hey.

124
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,870
Hey!

125
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,620
Hey, hold on!

126
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,020
Hey!

127
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,920
Hey.

128
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,200
Calm down.

129
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,820
Why did you take it?

130
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,660
Didn't I tell you

131
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,870
not to take it without permission?

132
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm sorry.

133
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,970
I just wonder what information is written about the blood moon.

134
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,050
Did you know? I'm drawing about...

135
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,230
Does he have to be this upset with me?

136
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,490
Even though everything was fine last night.

137
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,970
Hey.

138
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,130
I'm sorry

139
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,140
for taking your book without permission.

140
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,140
Hey.

141
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,310
I'm sorry.

142
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,520
Can you forgive me?

143
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,410
Can you hear me?

144
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,980
I'm sorry.

145
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,770
Hey.

146
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,720
We were still

147
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,120
good last night.

148
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,530
What happened to you today?

149
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,350
Fine.

150
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,370
I have a headache.

151
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,170
Please give me some medicine.

152
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,930
Hey, you!

153
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,640
Didn't you hear what I said?

154
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,350
Take your medicine and go to your room quickly.

155
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,850
I'll bring you dinner later.

156
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,410
Let me remind you again.

157
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,270
Never leave your room after sunset.

158
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,410
I forbid you from going anywhere after sunset.

159
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,880
How can you even say that!?

160
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,050
I came here because I wanted to see the blood moon clearly.

161
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,870
I want to see it with my own eyes.

162
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,930
Hey!

163
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,150
Wait!

164
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,300
Hey!

165
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,710
Why can't I leave my room at night?

166
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,210
What on earth is really going on here?

167
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,690
Hey!

168
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,310
[It's me]

169
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,760
Hey, you.

170
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,170
Let me ask you something.

171
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,130
Did you do anything to my stuff?

172
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,580
What do you mean?

173
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,020
Here.

174
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,370
Who wrote it?

175
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,970
Not me.

176
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,490
Huh?

177
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,050
If not you, then who?

178
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,990
I don't know.

179
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,250
You're serious about the Blood Moon, never change.

180
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,330
Both the drawing

181
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,030
and the notebook you stole from me yesterday.

182
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,180
What do you mean?

183
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,020
I am serious and never change?

184
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,460
Have we known each other before?

185
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,570
If there's nothing else,

186
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,450
you can leave now.

187
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,190
Oh.

188
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,840
It will be dark in a few hours.

189
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,450
Don't leave your room tonight, no matter what.

190
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,750
Hold on.

191
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,650
No matter what you hear,

192
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,040
do not leave the room.

193
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,980
If you do not want to encounter danger,

194
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,930
then do as I say.

195
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,730
What is the reason?

196
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,370
What you will encounter tonight

197
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,610
is beyond description.

198
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,110
Because I've been stuck in the past here for a long time.

199
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,450
I just pray that it will finally end

200
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,600
and be over.

201
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,100
It's here!

202
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,280
You came faster than I thought.

203
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,930
Do you miss me?

204
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,790
But tonight,

205
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,580
I didn't come to see you.

206
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,310
Now then,

207
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,380
where's my little prey?

208
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,800
Let's see who will survive and who will die tonight,

209
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,250
you or me.

210
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,920
You will know soon.

211
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,170
I, Thanu Ajitsara,

212
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,490
hereby offer my life to you

213
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,670
in exchange for a promise

214
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,790
to save my life.

215
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,570
Are you ready to go with me?

216
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,620
Hey!

217
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,520
Who are you?

218
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,100
Hey!

219
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:28,850
Go away.

220
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,430
Get out of here as fast as you can.

221
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,040
Run!

222
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,250
Chai Khun!

223
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:09,450
♬ It's not easy to explain every story ♬

224
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:19,520
♬ Describing the five rivers to the stars ♬

225
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:27,410
♬ No party lasts forever ♬

226
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:35,560
♬ Time has slipped away, leading us to a dead end ♬

227
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:44,679
♬ I wish the end would never come ♬

228
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:52,770
♬ Sorry, the ending is not like in the fairy tale ♬

229
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,290
Tonight will be longer than any night before.

230
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,660
Welcome

231
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,130
to the Blood Moon Night.
