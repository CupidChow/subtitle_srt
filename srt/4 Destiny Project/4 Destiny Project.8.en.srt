00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,740
Twist your body more.

3
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,940
Look at your opponent's face.

4
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,310
Punch.
Hold on.

5
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,140
Can't you stop smoking?

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,040
I stink.

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,640
If you don't like it, just go back.

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,290
It's not good for your health.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,320
My health or yours?

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,150
Your health!

11
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,170
Ouch, I have a cramp!

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,360
- What's wrong?
- I have a cramp!

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,990
Come on, stretch.

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,360
Stretch it out.

15
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,880
Properly.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,540
- It's hurt!
- Do you feel better?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,360
Flex your calf.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,600
Okay.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,810
Stay there.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,580
It's hurt!

21
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,690
My cramp!

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,290
I told you to stretch before practice, didn't I?

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,660
My cramp!

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Ouch!

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,010
What about my cramp!?

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,350
Help me first!

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,310
Good.

28
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,850
Up in the sky.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,380
Up!

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,270
Good. Stay.

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,220
Nom.

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,800
I'll right back.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,050
Yes!

34
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, dude! Hello!

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,580
Why did you come here?

36
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,350
You hang out at my house often as soon as you found out where I live.

37
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,770
I was worried you'd be lonely. You live alone, don't you?

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,190
That's why I'm here.

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,470
Am I lonely or are you lonely?

40
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,050
It's you.

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,440
Hey. Hey.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,950
This is my house.

43
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,000
I haven't allowed you to come in yet.

44
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,850
It's alright, I don't mind.

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
Come on!
Let's go.

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm the one who should mind.

47
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,930
Just go.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,210
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

49
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm the one who should be inviting you in.

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,290
Welcome.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,010
Yummy!

52
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,410
Where did you buy it?

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,090
I didn't buy it.

54
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,510
I made it myself.

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,630
Unbelievable.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,690
Are you bragging?

57
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,050
Huh?

58
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,010
I'm not bragging.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,110
I made it myself.

60
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,020
Even though it's not very good, I won't brag to you!

61
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,840
Give it back, don't eat it!

62
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,470
I put so much effort. (dialect)

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,950
Say what?

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,370
I put so much effort.

65
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,390
Don't eat it then!

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,930
Alright.

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm just kidding.

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,530
It's yummy.

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,020
So yummy.

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,580
Uh.

71
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,170
You're not doing deliveries today?

72
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,390
I didn't stop working.

73
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,760
I'll be heading out for deliveries in a bit.

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,010
Over there.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
The house spirits.

76
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,840
I told them to take care of the house.

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,540
Seriously?

78
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,830
It's my day off.

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,660
Can't you see that I'm free and chatting with you here?

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,900
You're talkative today.

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,290
And cracking jokes too.

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,620
Just say I'm not working today,

83
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,720
that's enough!

84
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,940
Why are you rambling so much?

85
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,650
So, what are you going to do today if you're not working?

86
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,630
I plan to give Khai Jiao a bath.

87
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,400
She's starting to get stinky.

88
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,320
Really?

89
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,390
Hey.

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,770
I'll help you. I'm free today.

91
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,220
It's fine.

92
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,580
Huh!?

93
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,640
I'll help you! I'm free today.

94
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,400
Okay?
No.

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,770
I'll help you. I'm totally free today.

96
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,260
Okay?

97
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,710
You don't have to.

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,610
I'll help you!

99
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,410
No.

100
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,390
Khai Jiao's about to get a bath~

101
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,060
Oh, wrong one?

102
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,580
Khai Jiao.

103
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,080
Yim.

104
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,910
Yim.

105
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,600
Umm.

106
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,730
You're awake?

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,150
I was just about to wake you up.

108
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,970
It's evening now, you can go home.

109
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,750
Your place is so comfy.

110
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,930
Can I keep sleeping?

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,520
No.

112
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,150
I'm just teasing, why are you taking it so seriously?

113
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,330
I'm gonna borrow your shirt and pants for now, okay?

114
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,630
I'll wash them and give them back to you later.

115
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,280
Yeah.

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,290
You can give them back to me later.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,980
Thank you. Bye.

118
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,700
Yim.

119
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,590
Huh?

120
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,160
What?

121
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,260
Next time, you can sleep over here.

122
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,290
You said it!

123
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,040
Don't be blaming me later.

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,450
Mark it.

125
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,770
Bye. See you.

126
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,650
Yeah.

127
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,150
Come whenever you want.

128
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,020
Okay.

129
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Bye.

130
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,150
Get home safe.

131
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,810
Hey.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,760
Here you are.

133
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,530
Here.

134
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,030
This is yours.

135
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,260
Drink something sweet. It will give you some energy.

136
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,800
What?
I didn't order it.

137
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,340
No thanks.

138
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,480
Then don't take it.

139
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,690
Just kidding.

140
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,700
I don't want to hurt your feelings since you got it for me.

141
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,620
Thank you.

142
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,170
See you this evening.

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,050
YES!

144
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,650
Left, right.

145
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
Left, right. Dodge!

146
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,570
1, 2 Dodge!

147
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay.

148
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,300
Straight punch.

149
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,810
Left, right. Dodge!

150
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,470
Left, right. Dodge!

151
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,210
Knee!

152
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,570
Nice.

153
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,080
Go for it!

154
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,030
Come on.

155
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,190
Left, right.

156
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,520
Left, right.

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,060
One more time.
Left, right.

158
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,160
Left, right. Knee!

159
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,770
Nice.

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,850
Hey, wait.

161
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,280
Do you know?

162
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,200
If I fight King again...

163
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,620
I can totally knock King over with a punch.

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,210
Yeah.
So what?

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,660
Huh?

166
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,120
That's all?

167
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,500
So, what do you want me to say?

168
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,180
Come on, give me a compliment!

169
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,400
If you want a compliment, you gotta pass the tryouts first.

170
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,740
Then get ready to compliment me.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,440
You're definitely giving me one!

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,700
- Come on.
- Come on.

173
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,630
- You got me fired up.
- Combo 3 hits.

174
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,880
Left, right.

175
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,450
Left, right.

176
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,900
Come on.

177
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,770
Thank you.

178
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,190
Kamphan.

179
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,870
Can I ask you something?

180
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,950
Yeah.

181
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,180
Why did you stop boxing?

182
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,890
A pro like you, it's obvious you're a former boxer.

183
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,920
I bet if you boxed again, you'd win without a sweat.

184
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,850
I really loved boxing when I was a kid.

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,850
I still remember my first visit to the boxing stadium with my dad.

186
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,020
Just think about it.

187
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,750
If there are hundreds or thousands of people waiting for our fight in the ring.

188
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,950
But the charm of boxing for me

189
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,280
is that you're fighting with only your body, nothing else.

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,180
If you train a lot, your chances of winning go up,

191
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,000
and you've gotta show everyone your skills in the ring.

192
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,790
But if you're weak, don't train, and aren't committed,

193
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,310
there's no way you'll win.

194
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,260
I think it's like an equal fight.

195
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,360
Just think about it.

196
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,080
Two people fighting like crazy in the ring,

197
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,580
but when the bell rings at the end of the round,

198
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,070
they apologize to each other.

199
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,980
You seem passionate about boxing.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Why'd you quit?

201
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,870
I killed someone.

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,410
Killed someone?

203
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,260
Are you fooling me?

204
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
Even though I didn't actually kill him,

205
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,840
but I ruined his chance of ever boxing again.

206
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,140
How is that different from killing?

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,730
What happened then?

208
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,830
I have a close friend named Tan Khun.

209
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,520
He is both my friend and my opponent.

210
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,830
He and I are about the same age.

211
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,680
So we were often paired up as boxing sparring partners.

212
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,180
Honestly, he's a better boxer than me.

213
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,120
Especially when I got into trouble with seniors or older guys,

214
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,500
he never left my side.

215
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,700
So you fought back and beat them, right?

216
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,950
Nah.

217
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,420
They stomped me into the ground, just like you.

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,260
Do you still want to listen?

219
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,650
Yes.

220
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,530
It was the youth championship that day,

221
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,960
Tan Khun and I were in the same competition.

222
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,790
So the two of us ended up facing each other in the final.

223
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,780
While we wait for the fight,

224
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,450
a group of boxers who had lost to me came at me.

225
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,840
They must have been really mad at me,

226
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,710
so they came to cause trouble for us.

227
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,299
They walked up and told Tan Khun and me

228
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,760
that we are husband and wife,

229
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,680
teasing us and calling us gay.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,360
I tried to deny it at the time,

231
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,280
but they didn't stop teasing us.

232
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,880
I couldn't take it anymore, so I punched them.

233
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,890
However, I was pulled onto the ring by the coach.

234
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,480
When I had to fight Tan Khun,

235
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,810
I tried to focus as much as I could.

236
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,010
But while I was fighting, voices from the side of the ring kept coming,

237
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,720
mocking and insulting me.

238
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,010
I...

239
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,390
I ended up pouring all my anger onto Tan Khun.

240
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,350
Before I realized it,

241
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,180
I saw him lying still in front of me.

242
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,180
If...

243
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,860
If I ignored what those guys said,

244
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,410
Tan Khun wouldn't be like this now.

245
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,330
I think that's ridiculous.

246
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,060
Why?

247
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,820
Even if you have feelings for Tan Khun,

248
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,380
it's not wrong at all.

249
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,210
Why?

250
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,830
Who made the rule

251
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,950
that women can only be with men

252
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,330
and men can only be with women?

253
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,270
People can love whoever they want.

254
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,520
It's totally fine, whatever the gender.

255
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,910
Fine,

256
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,860
you told me your secret,

257
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,760
I'll tell you mine too.

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,410
Actually...

259
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,030
Listen up.

260
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,820
My dream is...

261
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,530
I want to be the lead actor in a BL series.

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,580
Huh?

263
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,140
Look at this.

264
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,480
Just a sec.

265
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,320
Here. Do you see it?

266
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,150
P and Pan!

267
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,990
From AI No Kisetsu the series.

268
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,080
They went to Japan to film the series.

269
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,970
They became famous after filming ended.

270
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,930
They earned a lot of money.

271
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,320
Moreover, they have a lot of fans.

272
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,210
Damn, they are so fucking awesome.

273
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,130
How about this?

274
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,140
What if we made a clip together

275
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,370
as a ship?

276
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,150
How about this?

277
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,560
You and I should rehearse.

278
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,060
Wanna practice a kiss?

279
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,130
I'm tired. You can head back now.

280
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,600
Are you shy?

281
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,800
Are you shy?

282
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,250
Hey, give me a hand!

283
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Let's practice kissing,

284
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,939
so I can fulfill my dream of being a BL lead.

285
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,989
Come on. Let's practice kissing.

286
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,670
Yim.

287
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,470
Go back!

288
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm staying!

289
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,430
Yim.

290
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,910
Why're you getting shy?

291
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,560
One more time.

292
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,160
Okay.

293
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,510
Look at you, you can do it.

294
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,110
It's late today, let's continue tomorrow.

295
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,040
Are you coming to cheer me on tomorrow?

296
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,540
Hey.

297
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,550
Oh.

298
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,400
You guys are all here.

299
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,030
Yim, you bastard.

300
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,240
Come on, I like it. One-on-one fights.

301
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,080
Damn, so you think you're good?

302
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,550
Shit, you're cheating!

303
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,780
You think you're good? Damn.

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,270
You really think you're the hero?

305
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,530
Shit, he's hitting me back with the same move!

306
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,610
You think you're good?

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,700
Fuck.

308
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,300
Mr. Hero, who could possibly fight you?

309
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,850
You're gonna deal with me.

310
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,760
Hey, Yim!

311
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,550
YES!

312
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,709
I'm win!

313
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,870
You gonna be celebrating all day?

314
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,090
How about helping me first?

315
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,680
Damn.

316
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,560
You gonna keep staring at me all day?

317
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,940
Hey.

318
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,380
I really apologize to you.

319
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,810
You got screwed because of me.

320
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,070
Yeah.

321
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,310
It's alright.

322
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,960
We are friends.

323
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm glad too.

324
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,340
Glad?

325
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,260
What are you glad about?

326
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,910
Are you glad I almost got beaten up?

327
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,510
I'm glad to see your first victory.

328
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,670
Oh.

329
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,130
But what the hell kind of winner looks like this?

330
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,470
That's your look,

331
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,260
while

332
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm the spotless winner.

333
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,100
Your ego's getting out of hand.

334
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,570
Come on.

335
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,910
I'll clean your wound.

336
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,310
First, we need to disinfect it with saline.

337
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,850
And apply some Betadine.

338
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,700
You're good at this.

339
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,280
Of course.

340
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,150
I am an expert level.

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,380
You don't know anything.

342
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,280
I've been through hell!

343
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,400
Come on.

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,530
Dr. Yim's here to look after you.

345
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,510
Come on.

346
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,200
But... you're pretty tough.

347
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,150
You got hit with a bottle and barely got hurt.

348
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,180
I'm gonna apply it now.

349
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah.

350
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,000
What's wrong with you?

351
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,700
You're a big dude,

352
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,270
and this is making you act all dramatic?

353
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,630
Geez.

354
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,270
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,500
That hurts!

356
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,760
Sure thing! You hurt me first.

357
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,170
Huh?

358
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,470
I'm cleaning your wound.

359
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,300
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

360
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,360
I'll do it for you.

361
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,380
It's fine. I don't want to trouble you.

362
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,160
Let me do it for you.

363
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,270
Just trust Dr. Yim.

364
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,030
Stay still.

365
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,050
Be patient.

366
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,320
I don't trust this because of Dr.

367
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,310
Dr. Yim.

368
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,930
You don't know anything at all.

369
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,020
Before I could be Dr. Yim,

370
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,890
I had to take punches, kicks, knees, and elbows.

371
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,210
I've experienced it all.

372
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,700
So, you wanna take another elbow?

373
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,230
I'm good.

374
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,000
Here.

375
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,720
Thanks.

376
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,410
Uh.

377
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,000
I was gonna say this earlier.

378
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,110
You've got a full set of first-aid stuff.

379
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,690
You don't know anything.

380
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,690
I'm an expert at getting beaten up.

381
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,100
Are you happy now?

382
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,130
But I guess from now on,

383
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
I won't need them anymore.

384
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,980
Why?

385
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,860
I have you here.

386
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,640
Huh?

387
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,750
I have you here.

388
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,050
You are there to help me.

389
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,500
From now on,

390
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,680
if anyone comes to cause trouble for me,

391
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,130
I will punch them all.

392
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,030
Great.

393
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,210
I've got a new ring name.

394
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,470
I...

395
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,000
Two-Kampham-Yim.

396
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,010
What do you think?
Is it cool?

397
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,690
What two again?

398
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,240
Two. (song)

399
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,040
Boxers prefer to use the letter S.

400
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,050
Oh.

401
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,100
Does your S stand for bad luck?

402
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,280
Bad luck, my ass!

403
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,550
You don't know anything at all.

404
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,130
Two...

405
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,030
Two means two people, you and me.

406
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,700
You don't know anything.

407
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,160
Uh.

408
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,560
Send me the boxing gloves.

409
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,010
What are you going to do with it?

410
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Just send it to me.

411
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,920
Go get it for me.
Here.

412
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,540
The other one.

413
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,980
What are you gonna do with it?

414
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,820
Here.

415
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,830
Wait until I finish writing.

416
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,650
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,380
Hey, you writing shit about me?

418
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,740
You want me to write on your face instead?

419
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,120
I'll pass.

420
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,480
Here.

421
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,320
What the heck?

422
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,990
Check it yourself.

423
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,920
What the hell?

424
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,880
It's all wobbly.

425
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,750
Hammer?

426
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,270
Hammer?

427
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,730
Did you draw a hammer for me?

428
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,560
Kamphan. (fist)

429
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,230
Kamphan?

430
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,190
Yeah.

431
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,020
Kamphan?

432
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,840
Who taught you to draw?

433
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,130
Your drawing skills are seriously terrible.

434
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,160
Seriously...

435
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,950
Yim.

436
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,360
Yeah.

437
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,780
What you told me earlier,

438
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,170
were you serious?

439
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,940
Told...

440
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,940
What is it about?

441
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,000
What did I tell you?

442
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,700
Just...

443
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,150
You told me earlier that it's not only men and women who can fall in love.

444
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,400
Oh, this one.

445
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,880
It's true.

446
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,240
I really think so.

447
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,000
Love must be open-minded.

448
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,720
What if I told you

449
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,410
that I like you?

450
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,450
Oh.

451
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,610
Like me?

452
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,520
I like you too.

453
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,370
You're so nice to me, how could I not like you?

454
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,830
I'm not sorry.

455
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,520
I meant to do it.

456
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,100
So if I did this to you,

457
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,720
would you punch me?

458
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,550
What the hell?

459
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,160
It's kind of shaky.

460
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Hammer?

461
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,230
Did you draw a hammer for me?

462
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,120
Kamphan. (fist)

463
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,000
Kamphan?

464
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,920
Yeah.

465
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,650
Kamphan?

466
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,510
Who taught you to draw?

467
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,760
Your drawing skills are seriously terrible.

468
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,600
Seriously...

469
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,410
Yeah.

470
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,950
At least you'll feel me by your side during your fight tomorrow.

471
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,740
Oh.

472
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,790
You won't feel alone anymore.

473
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,350
Keep your guard tight!

474
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,580
Good.

475
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,110
Good.

476
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,550
Good. Good.

477
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,939
Quick! Strike him!

478
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
- Quick! Quick!
- Strike him!

479
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,770
Hey Yim, show some confidence!

480
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,769
Your boxing has gotten so much better!

481
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,040
Put on a confident face!

482
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,920
Keep your guard up!

483
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,640
Hey, calm down! Don't rush in yet!

484
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,190
Calm down! Don't rush in yet!

485
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,830
Back off!

486
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,570
Nice!

487
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,010
Attack again!

488
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,890
Attack!

489
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,320
Attack!

490
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,710
Attack!

491
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,840
Attack!

492
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,990
Attack!
Lock him up!

493
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,280
Lock him up!

494
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:12,890
Attack!

495
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,350
Quick!

496
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,290
Quick!

497
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,850
Hey, Yim.

498
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,880
Right on!

499
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,710
A real fighter keeps fighting no matter what.

500
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,890
Excellent.

501
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,180
Thank you, bro.

502
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,910
Hey.

503
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,670
Why are you here?

504
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,890
As you can see, I'm practicing boxing.

505
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,270
I know you're practicing boxing.

506
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,650
But how did you get in here?

507
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,840
I've told my dad already.

508
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,350
Your dad?

509
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,460
But this is a boxing gym.

510
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,940
Did you ask the owner for permission yet?

511
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,260
That's right.

512
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,450
I told my dad already.

513
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,270
Yeah, I know you already told your dad.

514
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,510
It's great that you let your dad know.

515
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,760
But this is a boxing gym.

516
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,500
You must ask permission from the gym owner first.

517
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,650
That's what I mean.

518
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,380
My dad owns a boxing gym.

519
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,230
Huh?

520
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,800
It's good that you're back training.

521
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,990
Yes, Fon.

522
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,250
Huh?

523
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,520
What are you confused about?

524
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,630
Will you practice?
Come on.

525
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,360
What the heck?

526
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,650
Come on.

527
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,870
Come on.

528
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,230
Do it properly.

529
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,760
Do you like my shirt?

530
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,370
No.

531
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,710
I don't have a shirt, so I just wear it.

532
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,890
Damn! I'm not hitting you at all!

533
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,070
I'm exhausted.

534
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,610
Alright.

535
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,260
You've improved so much.

536
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,330
Really?
Yeah.

537
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,020
Nice.

538
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,350
Just... I'm a little better than you.

539
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,960
Hello.
Tan Khun is back.
