JR is the only connection

542
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,264
of Jackie Bartolome to Legacy.

543
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,809
So, he's the one Renato Reyes was referring to.

544
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
He was already cleared.

545
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,479
Besides, why would he connive with Jackie?

546
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,898
He's a victim too.

547
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,608
There's no way out of this.

548
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,067
You need to find a scapegoat

549
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,861
if you don't want to get involved.

550
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:53,427
What the...

551
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,409
[BLOW LANDS]

552
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,535
[GRUNTS]
[BLOW LANDS]

553
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,662
- What's your problem?!
- Sir, that's enough!

554
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,707
You're not my friend and you're not my brother!

555
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,459
You ungrateful jerk!
