So if they don't come to us,

371
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,676
we will deliver our coffee
to them.

372
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,474
But there are already other
existing delivery apps here.

00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,017
Why would we compete with them?

374

well, most, if not all,

have diminished taste

because the ice has melted.

383
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,251
So you are suggesting that we
develop our own delivery app?

384
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,711
No, sir. My proposal is that
we introduce

our own delivery service through
our social media accounts.

386
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,009
That way, we will minimize
costs, and at the same time,

387
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,387
we'll be able to get
the word around right away

388
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,515
that this implemented project
is a done deal.
