00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,000
Maybe you'll click with him.
I think you'd make a great pair.

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Are you giving me away?

366
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,700
["HELLO MY LOVE"
INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING]

367
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:17,700
Why?

368
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,099
Are you mine to give away?

369
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,700
["HELLO MY LOVE"
INSTRUMENTAL CONTINUES]

370
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,599
Oh! Looks like she said yes!

371
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,900
Said yes to what?

372
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:01,700
Maxie's talking about that guy.

373
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,200
I know what you and JR
were talking about

374
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,599
during the meeting.

375
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,900
I hope you've
told her the truth.

376
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,599
Actually, on the way home,

377
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,999
I forgot to tell her.

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,599
Matteo, be honest with me.

379
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,200
Can't you tell her because
you're afraid to lose her?

380
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,900
You deserve to be happy.

381
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:26,000
You really do.

382
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,200
And I just want you to know,

383
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,799
I promise I will never
hold you back.

384
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,200
Oh, Matt...

385
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:37,499
Your future girlfriend
will be very lucky.

386
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
I just know it.

387
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,299
Matt is lying to me.

388
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,499
How can you be sure
that he is Online Matt?

389
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,099
Matt is low-key
setting me up with his friend.

390
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,599
Why all of a sudden?

391
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,599
Cha?

392
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,599
Hello, Matt?

393
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,599
I want to meet your friend.

394
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,099
You mean JR?

395
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,200
Yes.

396
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,900
I want to be introduced.
