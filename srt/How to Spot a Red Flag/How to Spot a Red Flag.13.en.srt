Sir Matt
is really handsome, right?

363
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,299
Such a snob.

364
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,099
Divine, you should have
your eyes checked.

365
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,599
I think your vision is starting
to get blurry.

366
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,200
I think JR is trying
to make it up to my daughter.

367
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,599
Or what if we help you
find a new place?

368
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,499
Because we have
a lot of associates

369
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
who are leasing
their properties.

370
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,500
Maybe even if we
find a new place,

371
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,700
we'll still struggle
with the operational cost.

Um...

373
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,099
The truth is
before the land was purchased,

374
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,400
we were already short on funds.

375
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,099
So, it will take a long time
before we can reopen.

376
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,900
But my husband has a game plan

377
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,499
so I think we're okay.

378
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,799
Especially now that Cha
is working,

379
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
it will help us recover.

380
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,900

for taking Argel's phone.

It's hot. I'm glad
he didn't scold us.

388

He's very professional.

389
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Well, why is he like that?

390
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:10,400
Is that his tactic to look good?

391
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,500
I think he's just nice.
