true to yourself,

364
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,799
you have to be brave.

365
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,426
I had to tell Cha the truth.

366
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,594
She deserved to know.

367
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,804
There's nothing I can do
about that now.

368
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,307
Yes, good. So let's move on
from what happened.

369
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,600
No.

370
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,810
I'm not going to move on.

371
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,312
I'm not going to give up on Cha.

372
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,230
I'll pursue her...

373
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,232
until from being haters,
we become...

374
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,484
Lovers?
