1
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,572
Stop!

2
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,251
Stop.

3
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,423
Calm down.

4
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:01,479
Bitch.

5
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:48,926
Island of Desire.

6
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,787
It's stuck.

7
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,292
Hey!

8
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,428
Tell it to shut up

9
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,063
before I shoot it!

10
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,523
Bastard.

11
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,977
I'll give it a push.

12
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,700
You should've done that already!

13
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,487
It's not working!

14
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:21,235
Hello?

15
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,286
Mr. Lee?

16
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,287
Where are you?

17
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,357
I'm on my way.

18
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:28,159
Let's talk face to face.

19
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,411
I'm leaving.

20
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,580
I have nothing to say to you.

21
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,085
Why are you coming here?

22
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,669
Damn it.

23
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,138
Listen.

24
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,431
Is this enough?

25
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,242
Something wrong?

26
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:23,181
Today sucked.

27
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:27,085
Two nobodies and one old man.

28
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,089
How can I make a living like this?

29
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,140
Damn it.

30
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:35,193
Excuse me.

31
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,862
Whatever's fastest please.

32
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,985
What's that smell?

33
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,707
Does she even clean this place?

34
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,624
Why is he drinking already?

35
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:09,344
No one came to fish today.

36
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,295
Whether the ship is full or not,

37
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,014
it still has to sail.

38
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,266
He just wasted a lot of fuel.

39
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,567
Excuse me miss.

40
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,354
Is there a towing company here?

41
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,688
Not here.

42
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,524
Go ask the mayor.

43
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,693
It'll come.

44
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:28,646
Enjoy.

45
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,872
Is that for hunting?

46
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:39,590
What?

47
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,127
Is there a good spot?

48
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,545
Let's see...

49
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,714
Some villagers said

50
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:50,551
they saw boars swim to the island.

51
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,721
But I'm not too sure.

52
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,230
Which island?

53
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,282
Seokdo.

54
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,903
But you shouldn't go there.

55
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,240
It's cursed.

56
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,411
Miss.

57
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:19,297
How can I get there?

58
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,633
That man just now...

59
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,837
Is taking some people close to Seokdo

60
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:27,088
for fishing.

61
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:29,307
Why don't you ask him?

62
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,676
Sure.

63
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,212
Do you take credit cards?

64
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,265
Of course not!

65
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,016
This is an island.

66
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,106
Dong-eun.

67
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,607
You need to pay.

68
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,114
What's taking so long?

69
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:54,615
Let's go!

70
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,203
He always makes decisions alone!

71
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:11,582
Miss.

72
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,353
Try to stop your boyfriend.

73
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:20,191
A lot of soldiers who trained in Seokdo

74
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,860
went mad and died.

75
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:26,597
That's why we don't go there.

76
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:40,828
Sorry!

77
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:43,498
Wait!

78
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:44,615
This way.

79
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,252
I have nothing to say to you!

80
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,420
Mr. Lee!

81
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:51,649
Which one should I pick?

82
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,234
This one!

83
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:54,652
Here, look.

84
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:04,245
Just like that.

85
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,801
You're good!

86
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,988
That's so gross.

87
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,659
That's why I didn't want to do this!

88
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,227
But we came all the way here!

89
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,808
Mr. Lee.

90
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,977
I came all the way here.

91
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,696
Please just...

92
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:12,980
Give me a chance to talk

93
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,816
and let it go.

94
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,489
Gross.

95
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,080
Miss.

96
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,665
What are you doing?

97
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,784
Why are you surprised?

98
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,386
I only wanted to teach you how to fish.

99
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,888
It's okay if you don't want to.

100
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,095
I hate that guy.

101
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:48,066
I want to get out of here.

102
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,527
Delicious.

103
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,363
Anyways...

104
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,699
Why are my customers today

105
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,984
not interested in fishing

106
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,921
when they're on a fishing boat?

107
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,047
Captain, you're too cruel.

108
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,300
You didn't even cover its eyes

109
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,670
when you're cutting its flesh.

110
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,180
Captain.

111
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,182
We're not catching anything anyways.

112
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,901
I mean...

113
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,737
No one's interested in fishing here.

114
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,906
Can you drop us off on an island

115
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,240
so we can take a look around?

116
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,996
We still need to talk about it.

117
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,297
Hey.

118
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,466
Are you gonna just

119
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,335
stare at the sea without

120
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,586
catching anything?

121
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,592
Don't worry.

122
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,011
It'll be so much better.

123
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,764
I'll make sure you have fun.

124
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:18,189
How do the rest of you guys think?

125
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:21,943
Okay!

126
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,661
Let's head to the island!

127
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,496
Yes, sir!

128
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,697
Let's go!

129
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,575
Beautiful.

130
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,829
Do you want a kiss?

131
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,667
Guys, come here!

132
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,452
Let's take a picture.

133
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,503
Get in here!

134
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,509
What a beautiful view!

135
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:30,345
Hey.

136
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:31,679
Smile.

137
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,297
Hey.

138
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,300
Give a sincere smile.

139
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:40,605
Nice.

140
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:44,776
Okay, you can go now.

141
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,778
I don't need you anymore.

142
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,147
Now, that's a nice view!

143
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:56,371
It's so windy, and I'm sea sick.

144
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,706
Why is he so excited?

145
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:01,259
I should tell Bongdoo to bite him.

146
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,428
Right Bongdoo?

147
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:05,880
I'm sorry.

148
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,715
Hang in there.

149
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,716
Whatever.

150
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,816
(Do not enter.)

151
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:35,860
Guys!

152
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,795
Don't go too far!

153
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,697
We'll meet here again later.

154
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,541
Bongdoo!

155
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:51,843
Bongdoo!

156
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,928
Moon-hee!

157
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:58,099
Let's go.

158
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:03,688
Are you cold?

159
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,490
Do you want some clothes?

160
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,158
I said I'm fine!

161
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:09,444
Nice view.

162
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,028
Amazing.

163
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,013
Bongdoo!

164
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,349
Bongdoo!

165
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:32,850
Bongdoo!

166
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:38,856
Bongdoo!

167
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:56,908
I knew that dog would be trouble.

168
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,610
If I can't find a boar...

169
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:02,497
Should I shoot that dog?

170
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,352
Wait.

171
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,195
Do you know what the most important thing

172
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:45,329
is when shooting an arrow?

173
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,281
Breathing.

174
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,618
This is...

175
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,538
The best way to practice breathing.

176
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,887
I think someone's watching us.

177
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,472
Stop.

178
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,725
No one lives here.

179
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,093
Who could watch us?

180
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,311
And so what?

181
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,097
It's fun.

182
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:46,591
Are you serious?

183
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:50,011
You were seeing him, while seeing me?

184
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:54,298
Ah-young.

185
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,435
I was wrong about you.

186
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:00,605
You cheated on me.

187
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,024
It's not that simple.

188
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:06,444
I don't know how I feel either.

189
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:12,450
Please just leave me alone.

190
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,205
You and I dated for so long...

191
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,425
You only dated him for 2 months

192
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,043
but that doesn't matter?

193
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,263
How could I understand that?

194
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:27,715
Would you?

195
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:30,835
Break it off.

196
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:33,971
Or make a choice.

197
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,724
Is that really necessary?

198
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:37,775
Then what?

199
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,345
What do you want me to do?

200
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,950
It's driving me crazy.

201
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:50,905
I know you went away with him last week.

202
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:55,576
But I still waited for you.

203
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:56,577
You know why?

204
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:02,366
I wanted to talk to you first.

205
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:11,008
Ah-young.

206
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:13,878
Listen.

207
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:18,766
I can die for you...

208
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,935
To prove that how much I love you,

209
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,439
I can jump from here.

210
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:31,279
Ah-young.

211
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:33,448
Watch.

212
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,901
Watch me.

213
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,677
Ah-young, I love you.

214
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,797
Please remember me.

215
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,135
Hey!

216
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:15,990
It wasn't me.

217
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:18,326
You saw it too!

218
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,827
I didn't kill him.

219
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,329
Of course.

220
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:22,380
I know.

221
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,832
Take out the arrow first.

222
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,341
What should we do?

223
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,010
I'm scared.

224
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:38,096
Let's get out of here.

225
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:09,043
Don't tell anyone about this.

226
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,212
Okay.

227
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:18,970
Did you see my Bongdoo?

228
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:39,574
Did you hunt?

229
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,126
No.

230
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,244
Then why...

231
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,662
Is there blood on it?

232
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:51,085
Anyways, where did the young couple go?

233
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:52,704
I know.

234
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:55,923
I bet they're having a good time!

235
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,213
Hey!

236
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,431
Wake up!

237
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,649
Miss!

238
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,684
What happened?

239
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:12,940
What?

240
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:14,225
Died?

241
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:16,327
Who killed him?

242
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:21,449
There's someone there?

243
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,284
He's the killer?

244
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,119
Say something!

245
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,454
Say something!

246
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:27,622
That's enough!

247
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,744
She's in a shock.

248
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,463
She needs to rest for a while.

249
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:49,594
Jong-soo.

250
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,979
Do you know them?

251
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,533
The thing is...

252
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,436
I was in that Forrest too.

253
00:26:58,653 --> 00:26:59,654
What?

254
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,441
I...

255
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:05,376
Was doing it with Geun-eh.

256
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:10,832
But it felt like someone was watching us.

257
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,836
I think there's a pervert in this island.

258
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:18,673
I had my bow

259
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:20,224
so he couldn't do anything to us.

260
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:23,728
But since they look young...

261
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,264
He killed her boyfriend...

262
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:28,933
So he can rape her.

263
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,018
Hey.

264
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:31,519
You took it too far this time.

265
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,856
You saw the blood on my arrow.

266
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,944
I shot that into the trees.

267
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:42,146
No one was there but...

268
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,199
There was blood on my arrow.

269
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:47,652
Isn't that weird?

270
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,537
Damn.

271
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,489
I'm getting scared.

272
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:53,825
Jong-soo.

273
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:55,710
Let's go to other people.

274
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,045
Hurry!

275
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,177
Where were you!

276
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:48,846
Don't talk to me.

277
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:52,683
Eat your damn fish.

278
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,941
It's so good.

279
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:00,992
Try some!

280
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,619
I don't want any.

281
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:14,706
From now on, I'm only eating

282
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,040
if it's still alive.

283
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:35,226
Hey.

284
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,310
Someone died.

285
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:37,595
What?

286
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:39,697
No one lives here.

287
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:40,932
Who?

288
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,819
I saw it.

289
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:46,738
It wasn't me.

290
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,991
I didn't do anything.

291
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:53,661
I didn't kill him!

292
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,662
Don't worry.

293
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:57,248
People here will help you.

294
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,668
Let's go look.

295
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,005
Let's go find...

296
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,840
Her boyfriend.

297
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,677
I'll wait here until our ship comes back.

298
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:12,096
We can call the police then.

299
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:14,515
Okay.

300
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,017
Since I work with medicine,

301
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:18,436
I'll stay and take care of her.

302
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,021
Medicine?

303
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:22,273
You're nothing but a fraud.

304
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:26,527
Why are you doing this to me?

305
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:28,446
What?

306
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,032
Whatever.

307
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,151
Dong-eun, let's just go.

308
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:36,120
Let's go catch that pervert murderer.

309
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,323
What are you waiting for?

310
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,541
Let's go!

311
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,045
Dong-eun!

312
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,330
Good.

313
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,332
Moon-hee, let's go.

314
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,051
You need to find Bongdoo too.

315
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:18,196
What's wrong with him?

316
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,297
I'm so scared!

317
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,915
Let's just follow him.

318
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:23,167
He's pissed off right now.

319
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:24,302
Why?

320
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:27,922
That guy saw him and Geun-eh having sex.

321
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,008
That pissed him off?

322
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,428
Why did he bring a hostess here?

323
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:34,846
She's...

324
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,214
One of the best.

325
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:38,983
What's wrong with your!

326
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,768
She's still a hostess.

327
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,271
I have to find Bongdoo...

328
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:44,772
But look at him!

329
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:48,559
Okay, I'm sorry.

330
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,321
Are you okay?

331
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:35,490
We can't keep going like this.

332
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:37,375
Hey!

333
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:39,210
Are you kidding?

334
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,245
We're looking for a murderer.

335
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,665
Wake up!

336
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,785
People like him die first in movies.

337
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,526
What are these

338
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:16,948
Maybe soldiers were stationed here.

339
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:44,068
Hurry!

340
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,973
Don't move!

341
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,360
Bongdoo!

342
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,991
(Wanted.)

343
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:26,995
What the hell?

344
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,384
What a pervert!

345
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,506
Don't!

346
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,227
I said don't!

347
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,437
I'll do it.

348
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:58,276
She needs to be able to breathe easily.

349
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,778
Don't listen to him.

350
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,246
He's a fraud.

351
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:05,867
Mr. Lee.

352
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,919
I know you're angry.

353
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,754
But you shouldn't talk like that to me.

354
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:11,706
What?

355
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:13,157
So?

356
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,928
Why did my wife from your medicine?

357
00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:18,596
Mr. Lee.

358
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,331
This isn't a medicine.

359
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:22,133
It's a supplement!

360
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,802
What happened isn't possible!

361
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:25,887
That's why

362
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,389
you should've read the instructions!

363
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:31,943
And our product...

364
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,180
Is organic and was approved by the FDA!

365
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:38,399
Fine.

366
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,352
Tell me the truth in front of that lady.

367
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:43,738
Stop!

368
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:46,157
Talk about that later.

369
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:48,693
Taking care of her is our priority!

370
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:56,918
Mr. Lee.

371
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,169
Mr. Lee!

372
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:05,977
Walk straight!

373
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:18,272
This fucker...

374
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:20,274
Was hiding.

375
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:25,947
Wake her up.

376
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:27,615
We need her to ID him.

377
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:31,536
I didn't do it.

378
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:44,966
It was him!

379
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:46,467
You bastard!

380
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,310
Bastard!

381
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:07,989
You need to go to prison!

382
00:38:11,326 --> 00:38:13,411
You're going to prison!

383
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:18,950
I'm sorry sir!

384
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,001
I'm on it sir!

385
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,170
I'm on it sir!

386
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,421
Right away sir!

387
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:37,402
Help me.

388
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,020
Help me.

389
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:42,357
You know the truth.

390
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,776
I didn't kill him.

391
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:52,116
Help me.

392
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:54,535
Help me.

393
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:15,840
Fuck!

394
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:17,558
How could you

395
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:20,061
let the murderer go!

396
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:26,617
Where is he?

397
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:31,906
Do what I do.

398
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,241
Slowly.

399
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:39,497
Breathe out.

400
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:41,466
Are you okay?

401
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,634
Take this, it could help her.

402
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,754
What are you doing?

403
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,876
Let's go find him.

404
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,762
He's stuck in this island anyways.

405
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:58,683
And...

406
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,601
I'll take care of her.

407
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,154
Damn it!

408
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:07,358
One of you has to come with us!

409
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,111
Why do I have to go and not him?

410
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:13,948
Didn't you beat him up too?

411
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:16,567
He ran away bleeding a lot.

412
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:19,504
You think he'll only try to get back at me?

413
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,240
Fine.

414
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,291
I'll go.

415
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:25,910
You're a fraud but you still

416
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,512
want to take care of a patient?

417
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:29,514
I'll see you when I get back.

418
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:31,182
Coward.

419
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:35,720
What about us?

420
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:38,639
Of course you have to come!

421
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:43,528
Geun-eh.

422
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:45,313
Take care of her.

423
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,232
Oh, and...

424
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,985
People who stay behind

425
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:53,538
should get weapons for protection.

426
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:02,780
Damn fraud.

427
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,185
Here.

428
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:27,305
Thanks.

429
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:54,892
Would he...

430
00:42:55,326 --> 00:42:56,861
Really hide here again?

431
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:58,896
He's probably in a cave.

432
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:00,898
Do you think...

433
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:02,734
He'll try to get back at us?

434
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,168
I...

435
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:05,953
Just kicked him once.

436
00:43:06,537 --> 00:43:08,072
I didn't beat him up that badly.

437
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:11,793
Hey.

438
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:14,462
We're on a same boat now.

439
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,798
Do you think the murderer

440
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:19,801
will let people go?

441
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,855
We have to catch him.

442
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:25,973
Or he'll have the advantage

443
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,358
since he knows this island better.

444
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:55,386
Excuse me.

445
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,340
What are you doing in this island?

446
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:01,092
Someone died.

447
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:03,961
There's a murderer in here.

448
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:09,350
What murderer?

449
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,519
We've been fishing here for a few days.

450
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,521
Didn't see a single living thing.

451
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:16,024
It's true!

452
00:44:22,447 --> 00:44:23,531
Isn't this blood?

453
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:13,364
I'll give you a lot of money

454
00:45:13,464 --> 00:45:14,916
to get me out of here.

455
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,584
We're camping on the other side

456
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:17,585
of the island.

457
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:19,470
If something happens,

458
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:20,972
come to us.

459
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:27,428
Mister!

460
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:39,891
Attention!

461
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,111
Private Kim Sam-soo!

462
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,395
At your service!

463
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:53,287
Dong-eun!

464
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:57,709
Behind you!

465
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:39,717
Dong-eun!

466
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:40,952
Dong-eun!

467
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:53,931
Dong-eun!

468
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:01,606
What's going on?

469
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:17,822
Let us leave.

470
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:19,874
I'm scared!

471
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:22,627
Shut up!

472
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:26,047
Don't try to run away!

473
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:28,132
Are you out of your mind?

474
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:29,834
What revenge?

475
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,335
We have to get out of here!

476
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:32,970
Fuck!

477
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:35,673
What's wrong?

478
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:40,311
If anyone moves without my permission,

479
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,147
I'm going to shoot you first.

480
00:48:28,276 --> 00:48:29,894
Damn it!

481
00:48:31,446 --> 00:48:33,731
Why is he in here!

482
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:35,233
That scared me.

483
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:38,953
What do we do now?

484
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:44,409
Don't worry.

485
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,045
I'll protect you.

486
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:48,679
Let's

487
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,466
make weapons to protect ourselves first.

488
00:48:56,387 --> 00:48:57,805
I don't care anymore.

489
00:48:58,089 --> 00:48:59,640
I'm just trying to survive.

490
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:15,873
I have to get out of here.

491
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,784
Good work guys.

492
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:30,788
I think that lady is stable now.

493
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:32,507
Oh.

494
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:35,343
Give me a weapon too.

495
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:40,465
Or...

496
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:44,902
This will help you relax.

497
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:45,937
Drink up.

498
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,531
What are you doing?

499
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,132
Where are you going?

500
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,421
Me?

501
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:58,142
You guys fight with that crazy person

502
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,143
okay?

503
00:50:59,177 --> 00:51:00,178
I'm...

504
00:51:01,012 --> 00:51:02,930
Gonna give this to the fishermen

505
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,482
and get out of here.

506
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,100
Bye!

507
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:08,936
Hey!

508
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,392
Come back...

509
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:21,232
A fraud?

510
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:24,001
I'm here because of you.

511
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,904
That's why I asked you to forgive me!

512
00:51:28,506 --> 00:51:30,792
Why is your wife's death my fault?

513
00:51:31,576 --> 00:51:32,960
It wouldn't have happened

514
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,412
if she read the instructions.

515
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:35,463
Right?

516
00:51:35,747 --> 00:51:36,748
Do you know...

517
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:39,133
How I got to where I am?

518
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,469
I can't stop here.

519
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:43,254
I'm getting out of here

520
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:44,756
and you're gonna die.

521
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:47,225
Die!

522
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,905
Ready for battle!

523
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:02,991
Forward!

524
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:39,277
No!

525
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:41,029
Go away!

526
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,531
Fuck.

527
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:26,684
Die!

528
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:29,137
Die!

529
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:40,064
Wake up already!

530
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:07,842
Take your time.

531
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:12,597
Then I'll tell you where

532
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,798
you can get a cell service.

533
00:55:14,132 --> 00:55:15,633
Call me if something happens.

534
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:19,604
There's a rock on the 9 O'clock side

535
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:20,605
of the dock.

536
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:22,023
Your phone will work there.

537
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,191
Okay!

538
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:26,310
Then don't come until I call you.

539
00:55:29,981 --> 00:55:31,699
Something doesn't feel right.

540
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:37,205
Whatever, he'll call.

541
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:22,333
Stop right there!

542
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:23,868
Fucker.

543
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,255
You're dead.

544
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:29,757
Shoot for 5 seconds!

545
00:56:33,478 --> 00:56:34,479
Forward!

546
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:52,448
You're not done yet, are you?

547
00:57:56,002 --> 00:57:58,588
Of course not...

548
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:21,194
Can I?

549
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:25,365
Sure...

550
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:34,791
Where's your boyfriend?

551
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,543
He died...

552
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:41,130
That sucks.

553
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,111
Do you like it?

554
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:47,613
You have to get me out of here, okay?

555
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,542
Where are you going?

556
01:00:34,327 --> 01:00:35,995
Where are you going?

557
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:54,063
This is it.

558
01:01:08,277 --> 01:01:09,862
Stay still.

559
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,865
Then I'll get you out of here.

560
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:03,583
Hey...

561
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,335
Let's hurry up and get out of here.

562
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,805
Stop talking to me.

563
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:10,673
I said okay already.

564
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:13,676
When I get out of here...

565
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,378
I'll treat you well, okay?

566
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:18,264
I'm very good.

567
01:02:23,886 --> 01:02:25,822
I'll think about it.

568
01:02:55,418 --> 01:02:56,419
Not her!

569
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:57,920
She's sick.

570
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:02,141
Buy one and get one free.

571
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:04,026
My boat is small.

572
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:05,812
I can't take all of you.

573
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:09,532
I should take the one I like, right?

574
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,401
Move, bitch!

575
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:14,370
What's wrong?

576
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:15,438
You have me!

577
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:19,542
Just wait!

578
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:22,161
She has a choice too!

579
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:25,498
Open up.

580
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:27,450
Open up!

581
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:30,053
Open bitch!

582
01:03:30,503 --> 01:03:31,838
I said, open up!

583
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:34,290
Open bitch!

584
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:35,842
Open up.

585
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:19,052
No!

586
01:04:25,224 --> 01:04:26,225
Please...

587
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,845
Mister, please...

588
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:33,516
You don't have a choice.

589
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,953
You want to live, don't you?

590
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:02,045
I didn't kill him!

591
01:05:18,444 --> 01:05:19,779
You bitch!

592
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:25,118
You'll pay for this!

593
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:28,621
What did you just say?

594
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:35,011
How dare you to talk to me like that?

595
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:36,629
Bitch.

596
01:05:43,252 --> 01:05:44,253
What?

597
01:05:45,188 --> 01:05:46,189
Who are you?

598
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:47,924
Joon-soo!

599
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:57,483
We caught a big one!

600
01:05:58,267 --> 01:06:00,653
You can't get out of it.

601
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:02,605
The more you move,

602
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:03,906
deeper it'll stick.

603
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:10,997
You'll be in a lot of pain until you die.

604
01:06:22,258 --> 01:06:23,626
Look at this fucker.

605
01:06:26,846 --> 01:06:27,847
Guys.

606
01:06:28,014 --> 01:06:30,016
Please, he's my brother.

607
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:32,802
Your brother?

608
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:34,354
He's my brother...

609
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:37,573
Brother my ass.

610
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,742
Do you think I'm a fool?

611
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:41,978
Do you do this...

612
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:44,647
With your brother?

613
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:53,456
Were you the bastard

614
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,158
who was in the trees?

615
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:00,797
Look.

616
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:03,299
Your arrow did this to me.

617
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:06,269
I almost died bitch!

618
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:13,476
Please...

619
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:14,844
Don't kill him.

620
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,280
I'll do anything.

621
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:19,348
Anything?

622
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:20,983
Really?

623
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:22,952
Fine.

624
01:07:23,286 --> 01:07:24,287
Then...

625
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:26,239
A partner change?

626
01:07:26,406 --> 01:07:28,658
Great idea!

627
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,411
The strongest owns everything

628
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:32,912
in an island like this!

629
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,632
I'm really good.

630
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,084
What the hell?

631
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,003
Wait.

632
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:43,873
I need some rest too.

633
01:07:44,924 --> 01:07:45,925
Hey.

634
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:47,844
Why don't you two fight?

635
01:07:48,261 --> 01:07:49,595
We'll only take the winner.

636
01:07:50,213 --> 01:07:51,214
Or...

637
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:53,015
I'll take you to that crazy person.

638
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:55,935
Fight!

639
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:57,019
Come here!

640
01:07:57,854 --> 01:07:59,939
Come here.

641
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:23,629
Nice!

642
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,798
Good!

643
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,052
Fight!

644
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:13,730
Mount!

645
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:18,518
Stop...

646
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:20,853
Don't.

647
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:22,939
We can both live!

648
01:09:23,523 --> 01:09:24,524
Please!

649
01:09:25,692 --> 01:09:27,910
Die!

650
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:29,245
Die!

651
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:30,980
Die.

652
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,031
Die!

653
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:34,367
Hey.

654
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,369
When did I tell you to kill her?

655
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,988
Are you out of your mind?

656
01:09:49,716 --> 01:09:51,667
Attention!

657
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:54,003
Murderer!

658
01:09:54,137 --> 01:09:55,471
He's going to kill us all!

659
01:09:56,139 --> 01:09:57,724
Forward!

660
01:09:58,224 --> 01:09:59,776
Battle formations!

661
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:05,231
Jong-soo...

662
01:10:05,565 --> 01:10:06,566
Are you okay?

663
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:12,739
So he was the rat in this island.

664
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:15,191
Army uniforms drive me crazy!

665
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:18,361
It reminds me of my idiot superiors!

666
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:20,913
No...

667
01:10:22,799 --> 01:10:23,800
No...

668
01:10:27,537 --> 01:10:29,038
I'm tired...

669
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:49,776
Kill him!

670
01:10:52,195 --> 01:10:53,613
Good!

671
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:04,407
Why are you hitting me?

672
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,459
I'll save you.

673
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:17,587
Stop...

674
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:57,343
I'm sorry.

675
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:00,096
I really am...

676
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:15,028
I'm sorry.

677
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:18,114
I wasn't able to protect you.

678
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:24,871
Jong-soo!

679
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:26,089
Jong-soo!

680
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:43,606
Die!

681
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,391
Die!

682
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:47,730
Die!

683
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:16,492
Even if...

684
01:15:17,627 --> 01:15:18,628
I'll die soon...

685
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:31,774
I didn't kill him!

686
01:15:34,177 --> 01:15:35,728
I didn't kill him!

687
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:33,619
Miss!

688
01:16:33,786 --> 01:16:34,787
Miss!

689
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:35,955
Drink some water!

690
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:39,375
Drink some water and tell me what happened.

691
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:10,440
What are you doing!

692
01:17:10,707 --> 01:17:12,542
Hold still.

693
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:15,078
You have blood all over you!

694
01:17:15,161 --> 01:17:17,280
What are you gonna do if people see you?

695
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:20,500
Look at all this blood!

696
01:17:24,337 --> 01:17:27,123
You liked what I just did.

697
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:46,025
Stop!

698
01:17:55,118 --> 01:17:56,869
Stop!

699
01:17:58,204 --> 01:17:59,205
Stop.

700
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:05,128
Calm down.

701
01:18:09,499 --> 01:18:10,833
Fuck!
