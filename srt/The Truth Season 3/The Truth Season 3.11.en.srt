00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,880
February 25, 2025

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,520
With the death of Tan Qian,

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,880
the truth hidden behind the Tuitian Confectionery Factory

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,120
finally came to light.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,240
This seemingly harmless candy factory

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,560
was actually a place filled with hidden dangers,

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,120
serving as a livestreaming base.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,760
After finding the real culprit

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,040
who killed Tan Qian,

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,880
An Wenche, who had appeared flustered that morning,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
showed up at the factory again.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
He returned to the factory.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,120
He claimed to have invested a large sum of money in the candy factory

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,680
and said he knew nothing about Tan Qian's death.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,960
He announced

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,440
that he would take over the full operation of the factory

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,240
and immediately end all livestreams.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,280
Everyone could only accept the reality for now.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,840
That night,

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,280
everything seemed to return to normal.

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,000
The six of them went back to the dormitory and slept as usual.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
But none of them expected

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
When they woke up the next day

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,840
they found themselves tied up

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,960
in the main hall of the second-floor streaming room

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,480
The factory's front and back doors were completely sealed

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,120
cutting off any hope of escape

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
The six of them worked together to find a way out

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,920
Three, two, one

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,600
Kick

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Who is this

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,360
But in the second-floor stairwell

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
they discovered An Wenzhe's body

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,200
He

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
died from electrocution

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
collapsed near the circuit breaker

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,280
The truth was once again shrouded in mystery

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
An Wenzhe's death

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
was carefully orchestrated by someone

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Murder

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
The killer must be among us

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
It's definitely not the two of us

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Right

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Because we were both tied up here since yesterday

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
After an initial investigation

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,360
the people involved in this case have been identified

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's search him first to see if he has anything on him

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,960
Does he want

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,360
this?

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,440
And this is his

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Hurry up

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,680
Get the stuff

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,320
We have to

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,680
take this

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,560
out

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,880
I want to ask

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
can you bring those

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
up here for us

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,320
so we can put them together up here

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,880
Sure

61
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,920
Hurry up, hurry up

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,640
What

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
What is this?

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
As the detective for this case,

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
I will remember

66
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,560
whoever I catch lying, I'll immediately identify as the culprit.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
We need more evidence.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Now, one by one,

69
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
we'll search the rooms of you suspects.

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,760
Let's go.

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
Because he said he was scared,

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,320
but he changed into such a nice suit.

73
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Who could, in a state of extreme fear,

74
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
still iron a suit and change into it?

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
And even dye their hair a bit red?

76
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,520
What time did you go?

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,960
Who are you? I'm the one questioning here.

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,440
And who are you?

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Alright, stop joking around.

80
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,160
So many murders have happened,

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
and you're still joking and laughing.

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Everyone, sit down properly.

83
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,120
Did I say you could stand?

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
It feels like we're at a boarding school,

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
getting scolded by the teacher after dinner.

86
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,480
"Innocent" is written all over my face.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
I have an idea.

88
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's leave someone here.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,120
If you want to stay, just say so.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
No, I think this way has a higher chance of success.

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,960
Then you stay here.

92
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm going to look.

93
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,880
No matter how hard it is, I have to find them.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,880
You go look. You go first.

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
I just got out.

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
You're a man, you go out and run.

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
Ning, I can be a woman.

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Right now, I...

99
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Bai Hanzi, I've never liked you.

100
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,840
Explain yourself.

101
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
This is

102
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,240
lit

103
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
missing

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,480
That one was torn off

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,360
I just wanted to say something.

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,040
He just said that I

107
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
am a very evil person.

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
But I just feel

109
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,000
very

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
And I want to say something.

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
You tricked us, the ignorant ones,

112
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,400
And you,

113
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,160
I am

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
also advertising to us.

115
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,680
Just to get those two

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
cheap skins worth a few bucks,

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,080
And you,

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
did so many bad things.

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,880
Without you,

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
no one would have lost their families.

121
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
No one would have lost so much money at home.

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
I can't get a word in anymore.

123
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
If I catch anyone lying, I'll immediately lock in the culprit.

124
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't bite your tongue, speak more slowly.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Lock in the culprit right away.

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
I've already given birth.

127
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Go out and take good care of my son.

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
We're working to earn money to support your child.

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,840
Is that what you mean?

130
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,560
It's up to you now.

131
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Okay.

132
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
It's obvious the culprit heard this.

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
They learned about the plan.

134
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
Then, when we woke up,

135
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
he was pretending too.

136
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Actually, he wasn't.

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
At first, he wasn't familiar with us.

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
But he

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
decided that we were

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
so he decided to kill us.

141
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Right.

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
Deep down, he actually hates this.

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes.

144
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah.

145
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
Alright, the case is solved.

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,120
Be careful.

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Impressive, that's some strength.

148
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
Pull-ups.

149
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,520
I only met this guy for the first time yesterday.

150
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
You don't know him.

151
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
That day he ran, and you didn't stop him.

152
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,520
Right.

153
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Wait, what kind of logic is that, man?

154
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
When I noticed it,

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
I only untied myself.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,920
I only untied myself.

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
That's a stretch, now everyone's starting to dance.

158
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,680
There's only one person's story left untold.

159
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
I really don't have a story.

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm just an ordinary person.

161
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,280
When I came in, I thought

162
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,000
I just wanted to make a living.

163
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,520
We won't need to

164
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
have one person carry another up, right?

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
But everyone's wet, how can we carry each other?

166
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
We can have Bai and He

167
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
pull you up.

168
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
Then we'll support you from below.

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
And it has to be the two of us.

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Because we're both tall.

171
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
Today's game is

172
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,520
Quick-fire balance questions

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
Please stand on a

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
fully opened newspaper to answer the questions

175
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,080
You have fifty seconds to think about each question

176
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
Read it again

177
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,040
What?

178
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,480
Read it again

179
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,320
You have twenty seconds to think about each question.

180
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
If you run out of time, it's considered a wrong answer.

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
For each wrong answer,

182
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
the newspaper must be folded in half once.

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
When you can no longer stand on the newspaper,

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
the quiz ends.

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
The challenge fails immediately.

186
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,240
If you answer ten questions correctly within three minutes,

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,400
you succeed in the challenge.

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,600
Understood.

189
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Please guess which player this is based on the partial image.

190
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,960
Whose else have I seen?

191
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,320
Zhou Keyu.

192
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,040
Liu Yuning

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
I haven't folded yet.

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,640
I haven't folded yet.

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,960
Then you fold twice.

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,760
Fold twice.

197
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
Please look at the following photos

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
and identify which one is Bai Yu.

199
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
How would I know?

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
I wasn't part of their childhood.

201
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
How am I supposed to know which one is Bai Yu?

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,200
A

203
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,600
Please speak.

204
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,360
Who is this?

205
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
May I ask who this is?

206
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
I really can't tell.

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,320
Is this Bai Yu?

208
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,160
This is—who is this?

209
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Liu Yuning.

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
This is Liu Yuning.

211
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,880
Encyclopedia.

212
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
How would I know what the encyclopedia says?

213
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,960
One hundred eighty-nine (centimeters).

214
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Correct, that's the right answer.

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Really?

216
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes.

217
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
That's too much.

218
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,320
Zhang Linghe

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,000
Correct answer.

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,640
Which one is not Dilraba?

221
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
That's cheating, C.

222
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,840
I can't even recognize myself in this.

223
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
I can't see.

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Help me a bit (bring it closer).

225
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,040
C

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
Liu Yuning

227
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,840
Correct answer.

228
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,760
Will I...

229
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,480
...get too many questions right?

230
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,360
Excuse me, at this moment...

231
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,160
Zhou Keyu said...

232
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,720
No, what did the canary say?

233
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,880
Zhou Keyu, you have this hobby?

234
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,120
Wrong.

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
What is this?

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
So perverted.

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Wrong.

238
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,880
So dirty.

239
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Lost.

240
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Which player is this?

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,800
Dilraba

242
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,160
Wrong

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
Liu Yuning

244
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Wrong

245
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,920
A

246
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
Okay, correct

247
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,880
Because that photo is the oldest

248
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,040
This is Liu Yuning, right?

249
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
Baike's height is

251
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
One hundred eighty-nine (centimeters)

252
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Correct

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
This is Zhang Linghe

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Let me think.

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
If it's A or B,

256
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
it should be...

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,400
C

258
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
Correct.

259
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Please find it among the following AI-generated children's photos.

260
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,440
It's made using Jin Jing's AI image.

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,880
C is generated by AI.

262
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Please sing a line.

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
of the song sung by Ba Zimei in "Tui E Lake".

264
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Wrong.

265
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,200
Please say which player is shown below.

266
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
Zhang

267
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
Zhang Linghe

268
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm nearsighted, I can't see clearly.

269
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,360
Please use the partial image

270
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,000
to guess which player this is.

271
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,840
For me,

272
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
what is he wearing around his neck?

273
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I can't see any of it.

274
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,520
Bring it over here.

275
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Just give it to me.

276
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
Let me take a closer look.

277
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,480
Zhou Keyu

278
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Announce the answer

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,400
Bai Yu

280
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
That's really interesting

281
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,280
Tell us whose photo this is

282
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,840
and which player's childhood photo it is.

283
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,400
Ning

284
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Wrong

285
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Wrong again

286
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Zhou Keyu

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Fold it again

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
This is really fun.

289
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Figure out which one is Bai Yu.

290
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
Are you kidding me?

291
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,720
It must be A.

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
Correct.

293
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Congratulations.

294
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm really impressed.

295
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,360
It seems like someone is starting to go easy.

296
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Please state the name of the player in the picture below.

297
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,760
And the player's height according to the encyclopedia.

298
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
Who is this?

299
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,240
Ning.

300
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
One meter ninety.

301
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,760
The correct answer is 189 centimeters.

302
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,680
Okay.

303
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,920
How would I know his height?

304
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
I can only rely on my own feeling.

305
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,760
I can't stand anymore, I lost.

306
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
Challenge failed.

307
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay.

308
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
Whose collarbone is this?

309
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,800
Zhou Keyu.

310
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
He also has this kind of...

311
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
...exaggerated moment?

312
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Okay.

313
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Whose childhood photo is this?

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,280
This is obviously Zhou Keyu.

315
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,760
Right.

316
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Which one is Bai Yu?

317
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Bottom right, D.

318
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,320
Wrong.

319
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,720
Alright, go ahead.

320
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
This is me.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
Liu Yuning.

322
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,360
Yes.

323
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
Let me take a look myself.

324
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Height is 189 centimeters.

325
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,720
Please use the facial features below

326
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,800
to guess which player it is.

327
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,520
This one.

328
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Zhang Linghe.

329
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,840
Yes.

330
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,640
His mole is quite noticeable.

331
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
Among the following photos,

332
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
find the one who is not Dilraba.

333
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
Top right, B.

334
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,480
Wrong.

335
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,320
Wrong.

336
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,320
Okay.

337
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,200
Wait a moment.

338
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Getting older, my balance isn't as good.

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Alright, come on, hurry.

340
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,000
"SuperStar"

341
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Eleven

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
Whose hand is this?

343
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
This is obviously my hand, right?

344
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Wrong.

345
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
I give up, I can't stand anymore.

346
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,400
Just say I lost.

347
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,360
I can't do this anymore.

348
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,000
Alright, thank you.

349
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,280
Which one is Bai Yu?

350
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,360
A.

351
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Correct.

352
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
You can tell it's from a different era.

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
This childhood photo.

354
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Zhou Keyu.

355
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,520
One meter eighty-eight.

356
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,840
Wrong.

357
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Which one is not Dilraba?

358
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,680
A

359
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,560
Wrong, it's C.

360
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Just take a wild guess—B.

361
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,680
That's not right.

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Pick C.

363
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,480
This is—

364
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,040
I don't know.

365
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
I don't really understand songs.

366
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,440
No.

367
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,680
Alright, then it's a failure.

368
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Liu Yuning

369
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,200
Zhou Keyu

370
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,880
This one's a bit hard.

371
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,200
D

372
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Incorrect answer.

373
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,360
This is Liu Yuning, right?

374
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
Liu Yuning is probably

375
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,880
one hundred eighty-nine (centimeters).

376
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Correct answer.

377
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,680
It's not Dilraba.

378
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,600
C

379
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:38,920
A

380
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,120
You used to like playing this.

381
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, pretty much.

382
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

383
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
You like playing this game.

384
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,280
You like playing this game, right.

385
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
Please look at the following picture.

386
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Name the song that was being performed at that time.

387
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,760
"Let's Watch the Meteor Shower Together"

388
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,040
That's not correct.

389
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:02,880
Time's up.

390
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Time's up.

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,360
Alright, you failed.

392
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,680
Failed.

393
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
And you forgot to fold it.

394
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Teachers.

395
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm done, right?

396
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Come on, let's take a look.

397
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,320
This is...

398
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,240
Alright, everyone.

399
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Please say whose hand is in the picture.

400
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
This collarbone...

401
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
You have to watch him every day.

402
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,000
Only by looking like this can you guess who it is.

403
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
And this one.

404
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,480
Whose childhood photo is this?

405
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
Please answer the following brain teaser.

406
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,360
The white balloon hit the black balloon.

407
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,320
What should the black balloon do?

408
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Pop.

409
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,520
Confession Balloon.
