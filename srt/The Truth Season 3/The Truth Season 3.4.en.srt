2
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,260
An unknown mist shrouds the city of Tui.

3
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,180
Players will experience

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,660
Each investigation, the six players will be divided into

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,100
detectives, suspects, and the real culprit.

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,940
The real culprit's task is to hide their identity

7
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,620
and avoid being discovered by the other players.

8
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,900
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie.

9
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,300
If the real culprit passes a challenge,

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,540
they can choose one detective

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,380
to turn them into X.

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,380
Once blackened, X joins the real culprit's team.

13
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,300
During the rest of the investigation,

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,340
X will help the real culprit escape.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,540
After the investigation, players vote for who they think is the real culprit.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,820
If the real culprit receives fewer votes than the other suspects,

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,620
the real culprit and X win the golden key.

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,420
Otherwise,

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,900
the other players who voted correctly win the golden key.

What is this thing?

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,300
What's going on?

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,820
Did something explode?

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,300
How did it explode?

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,180
Don't panic.

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,060
Do you still remember your mission?

39
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,660
I don't remember.

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,540
Where are we?

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,220
What are we supposed to do?

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,620
Do we have a mission?

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,700
Your mission

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,380
is to find a very important person.

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,900
This person is very dangerous.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,220
Is it the person we just saw?

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,380
The person in black from earlier.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,700
It must be the one from before.

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,980
The one in black we couldn't catch.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,060
It's him.

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,740
You came here to deal with him.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,580
To fix the trouble he caused.

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,220
But he set off the amnesia gas.

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,780
Your mission failed.

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,940
But it's okay.

56
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,220
There's still a chance.

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,940
Didn't you find

58
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,540
the places related to him?

59
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,380
He showed up in several other places.

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,700
I can

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,860
let you go to those places by rebirth.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,140
Go to those places.

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,780
You must

64
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,340
stop him.

65
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,220
There's been a murder.

66
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,300
There's been a murder.

67
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,580
Someone's dead.

68
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,340
There's been a murder.

69
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,820
Boss

70
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,700
The boss is dead. Who's going to pay our wages?

71
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,060
Go call Tangshao.

72
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,780
She's cooking.

73
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,980
She's still stir-frying.

74
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,940
Golden ladle

75
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,460
Ladle

76
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,340
Golden ladle

77
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Here it comes

78
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,540
I'm coming

79
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,660
Come

80
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,740
Come here, ladle.

81
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Someone's dead.

82
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,300
Is he dead?

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,140
He's dead.

84
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,420
I'm going to identify the culprit.

85
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,140
I want to—
If you keep doing this—

86
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,660
Now the boss is dead.

87
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,300
That's right.

88
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,580
But—

89
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,860
This morning—

90
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,540
Dengpao and I, Bai Huanzi,

91
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,580
the two of us just got back.

92
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,020
So—

93
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,380
the two of us aren't suspects.

94
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,220
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

95
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,500
The first case officially begins.

96
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,500
It is now February 25, 2025.

97
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,740
8:20 AM

98
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,100
The victim in this case is Tan Qian.

99
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,860
After a preliminary investigation,

100
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,140
the suspects have been narrowed down to

101
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,940
Ba Fen Tang,

102
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,620
Jin Tang Shao,

103
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,420
He Ni Ba,

104
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,100
Ke An Kan.

105
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,460
Among these four,

106
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,780
Ning Deng Pao and Bai Han Zi

107
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,340
were together the whole time

108
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
and have alibis for each other.

109
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,780
They are completely cleared of suspicion.

110
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,420
Therefore, you are the detectives for this case.

111
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,740
Now, detectives, please lead the suspects

112
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,300
and begin collecting evidence.

113
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,980
First, each of you please state

114
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,260
your relationship with the victim.

115
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,700
Is that okay?

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,300
First, I am at this candy factory—

117
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,980
as everyone knows,

118
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,260
I am the electrician here.

119
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,460
That's right.

120
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,460
This morning,

121
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,780
Bai Han Zi and I

122
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,380
went out together to buy supplies.

123
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,380
We just got back.

124
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:02,980
I am

125
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,500
the star welder at this factory.

126
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,860
Although I haven't been here long,

127
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
But because of outstanding

128
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,780
professional skills,

129
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,500
he was highly valued by the boss.

130
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,020
My relationship with him was also

131
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,740
just that of employer and employee.

132
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,260
We weren't close and didn't interact much.

133
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,820
It's very simple.

134
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,020
He hired me to work here as a security guard.

135
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,740
So I came here to protect his safety.

136
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,620
So you work here,

137
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,180
and then he died here.

138
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,780
Can I vote now?

139
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,740
It's not that simple.

140
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,220
It's really not that simple, okay?

141
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,500
Right.

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,540
The main thing is, just now there was a very suspicious person

143
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
who ran over and found the "body".

144
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,700
And he didn't even stop him.

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,300
I did stop him.

146
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,660
I immediately pulled out my stun baton.

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,460
Didn't you notice?

148
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,580
That person doesn't even work at our factory.

149
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,500
He was so suspicious, and yet he just...

150
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,820
Actually, we should talk about you.

151
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,140
I...

152
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,820
At the time, I was in the security booth.

153
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,060
You were right in front of him.

154
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,220
I'm the investigator.

155
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,900
As the investigator, you should have stopped him even more.

156
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,700
No.

157
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,140
I've already done my best.

158
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,500
I even pulled out my stun baton.

159
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,460
Right?
Alright.

160
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,900
Come on, Xiao Jin.

161
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,820
Hello everyone, I'm Jin Tangshao.

162
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,020
With just one shrimp,

163
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
I can make a whole Manchu Han Imperial Feast.

164
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,300
Seafood rice.

165
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
This skill

166
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,380
got me into this influencer company.

167
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,980
I joined three months ago.

168
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,500
Wait a second.

169
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,140
Why are you talking like that?

170
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,020
That's just how I am.

171
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,220
My name is Ba Fentang.

172
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,980
I'm twenty years old.

173
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm from this candy factory.

174
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,020
I'm a candy packer.

175
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,100
And with the boss,

176
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,220
it's just a normal employment relationship.

177
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,460
My name is He Niba.

178
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,260
And that's also my boss.

179
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,780
I'm just an ordinary employee.

180
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,940
Right now, all four of you are suspects.

181
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,260
So first, let's

182
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,180
check this "body."

183
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,180
Cell phone.

184
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,700
8888

185
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,100
There's a password.

186
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,540
Could the password be 8888?

187
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,580
Really?

188
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,740
Really?

189
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,660
Really?

190
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,020
You're very suspicious.

191
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,180
It says 8888 on it.

192
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,220
Yes.

193
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,340
That's right.
What is this thing?

194
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,380
Someone sent him a message, right?
That's right.

195
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,420
Boss An Wenzhe

196
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
7:59 in the morning
Sent him a message saying

197
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,940
Why can't I reach you?

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,300
I can only text you now.

199
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,180
I've already arrived.

200
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,540
Arranged to meet him at this place.

201
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,180
Isn't that the one from just now?

202
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,740
He killed someone.

203
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,340
The one in black is Boss An Wenzhe.

204
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,620
Boss An Wenzhe

205
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,300
This is very likely his boss.

206
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,340
There's also a video.
Play it.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,620
A person dressed in black

208
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,620
the process of committing the crime

209
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,500
Why is there a camera set up here?

210
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,140
Right, he recorded himself

211
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,940
Why did he do that?

212
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,700
Is he recording a video log of himself?

213
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,540
There's a timestamp

214
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,660
February 25th, 7 a.m.

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,580
Yes

216
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,300
What were you doing at 7 a.m.?

217
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,060
What were you doing?

218
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,180
Yes

219
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,820
What was I doing?

220
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,540
I was having breakfast. What was I doing?

221
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,700
I was also eating at that time

222
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,500
At 7 o'clock

223
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
What were you doing at 7 a.m.?

224
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
I was delivering breakfast

225
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,780
Okay, what about you?

226
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,860
At 7 o'clock, I was eating

227
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,820
Everyone says they were eating

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,420
Look, there’s still hair on it.

229
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,540
So this means that this is

230
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,900
what was used to hit the back of his head.

231
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,300
That’s right.

232
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
Let’s take a look.

233
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,740
It’s this one.
Right here.

234
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,620
Yes, there’s still blood here.

235
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,940
Fatal injury.
Lethal.

236
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,860
Why was he sitting here? Look.

237
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,260
He was already unconscious.

238
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Then someone walked over.
Saw that he was unconscious.

239
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,460
And hit him with a hammer.

240
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,180
So your deduction is

241
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,740
he wasn’t dead yet when he was lying here.

242
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,700
That’s right.

243
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,900
He was killed by it.

244
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Yes.

245
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,980
So let’s deal with the body first, okay?

246
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes.

247
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
Check the pockets.

248
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Security, get to work.
Yes.

249
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
Do your best.

250
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,820
Take off your shoes.

251
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,740
Why do you always...

252
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,460
...always tell others what to do?

253
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,740
Because I am...

254
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,620
the esteemed detective.

255
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,180
There's a key.

256
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,860
This key has "141" written on it.

257
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,100
Whose room is 141?

258
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,220
I don't know.

259
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,700
It's fine, just keep the key for now.

260
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,100
Hold onto it.

261
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Your job, you...

262
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,740
That's it, just a key.

263
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,780
Why is there a black cloth here?

264
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,180
Isn't this a cloak?

265
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,700
It's the one the person in the video was wearing.

266
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,420
The person from the video?

267
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,060
He even left his clothes here when he left.

268
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Right.

269
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,780
Who would just throw it there so conveniently?

270
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,300
You.

271
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,900
You dare hit the detective?

272
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,100
I'm just offering a possibility.

273
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,460
Let's keep searching.

274
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,020
This is the assessment score sheet.

275
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,420
This is Ning's lightbulb.

276
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,380
You only make 2,400 a month.

277
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,140
Why is that the lowest in the whole factory?

278
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,620
I'm an outsourced worker.

279
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,180
And I only work two days a week.

280
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,940
Ba Fentang gets 6,600.

281
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,500
6,600.

282
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,820
I get 6,400.

283
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,460
Ke An gets 7,000.

284
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,860
Why?

285
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,620
You have so little work.

286
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,420
And it's still that high?

287
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,580
I work so hard.

288
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,820
I'm here watching every day.

289
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,940
You can't even catch a guy in black.

290
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,740
And you get 7,000?
What's so hard about your job?

291
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
You don't do anything, you just stand there.

292
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,300
He's the one out in the wind and sun.

293
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,660
Yeah.

294
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,140
Out in the wind and sun?

295
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,260
Wait a moment.

296
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
There's a body beneath me.

297
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,820
I'm a security guard.

298
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,700
There's one more.

299
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Wait a moment, you guys take him away.

300
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't.

301
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,820
Catch him.
Hold him.

302
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,860
It's okay.
It's fine.

303
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,900
If we're going crazy, let's all go crazy together.

304
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,540
Or not, is that okay?

305
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,940
Wait, you're even scarier.

306
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,140
Really?

307
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,300
Where is the person?

308
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,900
Gone.
Where is the person?

309
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,340
There was a woman yelling nonstop.

310
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,220
Turns out it was her.

311
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,820
Then another one showed up.

312
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,620
I said, let's all go crazy together.

313
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,900
Ning has gotten braver.

314
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,420
I don't feel any fear anymore.

315
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,620
No fear at all.

316
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,140
That's right.

317
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,260
That's right.

318
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,140
He's become the boss now.

319
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,300
He's here to protect us.

320
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
You're the one protecting us.
Yeah.

321
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm going to follow you.
So cool.

322
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,740
I'm going to follow your super topic.

323
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,380
Okay.

324
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,060
Alright, sign me in.

325
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,220
Why are there these things?

326
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,700
That means there are some wronged spirits.

327
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,420
The boss probably isn't a good person.

328
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,460
I always felt something was off about our factory.

329
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,700
In our factory,
there's definitely something wrong.

330
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,940
Next, we'll go to the area where the four of you

331
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,500
suspects work

332
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,340
and conduct a search.

333
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,660
Please don't call us that.

334
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,460
Okay?

335
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,660
You four "prisoners,"

336
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,100
murderer.

337
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,220
How about we search the security guard's room first?

338
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,820
Okay.
Security guard's room.

339
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,340
There's a computer here, right?

340
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,340
What does a security guard need a computer for?

341
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,100
Of course, I use it to monitor the cameras.

342
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,940
You watch the surveillance footage?
Isn't that surveillance?

343
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,420
Check the computer first.

344
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,900
Access records.

345
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Workshop hall and living area.

346
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,300
There was an unusual door opening.

347
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Workshop hall.

348
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,540
Over there, that way.

349
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,780
We work here every day.

350
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,180
You need facial recognition to enter from the living area.

351
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,460
Right.

352
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,500
The person who just ran out,

353
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
his name is An Wenzhe.
Boss An Wenzhe.

354
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,860
He entered through the main gate first.

355
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,900
After coming in,

356
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,900
he walked there at 8:06.

357
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,140
He broke this when he went in.

358
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,860
Only then did he get inside.
Yes.

359
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
When he ran out the door,

360
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,860
it was 8:09.

361
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,940
So now this door is broken.

362
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,300
We don't need to scan anymore, it opens for everyone now.

363
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,860
Right.

364
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,220
No.

365
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,380
What are you security guards even doing?

366
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,660
This person keeps coming and going,
and you don't see it, do you?

367
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,020
We need to search thoroughly.

368
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,420
This is my workstation.

369
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,660
Yes, this is your workstation.
This is my workstation.

370
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,660
This is so heavy.

371
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,700
This one's heavy too.

372
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,060
These two are really heavy.

373
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,060
Is this syrup?

374
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,380
Is there something inside?

375
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,060
Syrup.

376
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,740
Okay.

377
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,060
You don't have a single clue or piece of evidence.

378
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
Because I'm innocent.

379
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,380
You're so clean.

380
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,580
That actually seems a bit suspicious.

381
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,860
You didn't eat all the evidence, did you?

382
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Swallowed it all.

383
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
My daily job

384
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,780
is to be responsible for

385
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,540
taking the empty packaging bags upstairs.

386
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,060
Then
I watch my Bafen candy

387
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,860
as it gets filled with candy.
Then the candy

388
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,140
Your what?

389
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,580
Another touching love story.

390
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,540
Your what?

391
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,020
My Bafen candy.

392
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Exchanging glances full of affection.

393
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,860
Put the bag on.

394
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,780
You two are at the factory.

395
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,620
You know what I mean.

396
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,660
You're no longer part of this story.

397
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
You're not in this story.

398
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,420
I want to ask.

399
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,140
Have you two made your relationship official?

400
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,740
That's right.

401
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,580
Our company has rules.

402
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,300
Coworkers aren't allowed to date.

403
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,580
Yes, employees can't date each other at the company.

404
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,540
But the boss is dead now.

405
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,740
So it doesn't matter anymore.

406
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,220
How could you do this?

407
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,300
So?

408
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,340
And?

409
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,580
Then let's go to our packaging workshop first.

410
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,620
This is the area for Ba Fen candy.

411
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,180
Okay.
Come.

412
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,900
Let me introduce everyone.

413
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,020
Over there is a workshop where candy is produced.

414
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,820
Yes, it's a sterile workshop.

415
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,180
It's not open to the public.

416
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
Is there a password?

417
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes, there is a password.

418
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,780
We can't enter the sterile workshop right now.

419
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,900
This is my work area.

420
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,460
Heniba will toss this net bag to me.

421
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,900
Just like this, toss it over to me.

422
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,820
Then I'll be over there, and those—

423
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,580
Heli, Mo, Jinyu's candies

424
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,500
will all be packed into the net bag.

425
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,580
Then I'll send them out.

426
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,060
This one is called Jin candy.

427
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,540
This one is called Li candy.

428
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,060
And also,
three types of Yu candy.

429
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,700
And one He candy.

430
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,260
After that,
he'll pack them into boxes.

431
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,180
Then they'll be shipped out.

432
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,940
Or go to

433
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,460
supermarkets and shopping malls.

434
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,140
Cockroach

435
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,060
What does this mean?

436
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,500
Why are there so many cockroaches?

437
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,420
I really feel wronged, you know?

438
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,380
What's going on?

439
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,100
What are you upset about?

440
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,460
This is my workplace.

441
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,580
Cockroaches often fall down like this.

442
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,020
That means our candy factory

443
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
has food safety issues.

444
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,620
Yes.

445
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,340
And while you were packing here,

446
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,620
Right.

447
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,740
Cockroaches like this often fall down.

448
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,420
They mess with me from time to time.

449
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
And also the one just now.

450
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
What is all this stuff?

451
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,500
I really feel wronged.

452
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,780
Does this happen a lot too?

453
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,100
Someone's messing with me.

454
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,340
Who's messing with you?

455
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,460
And also,

456
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,300
What did I do wrong?

457
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,700
You have to bully me like this

458
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,660
for being too beautiful

459
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,340
I understand.

460
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,660
Do people target you just because you're pretty?

461
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,860
No.

462
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,900
So your desk is usually right across from hers?

463
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,220
You—
Her, this...

464
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,580
I haven't seen it.

465
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
I've never seen it before.

466
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,300
You can't even see this.

467
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,540
I really haven't seen it.

468
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,940
You two are so close together.

469
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,540
There's a hollow space in the middle.

470
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,900
I've never seen it before.

471
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,060
I haven't seen it.

472
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,300
I've never seen it before

473
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,900
She's the only one I see

474
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,700
Got it.

475
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,260
Even if you're covered all over

476
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,820
with cockroaches,

477
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,940
you still can't take your eyes off her.

478
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,980
And she has blonde hair,

479
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,860
so the cockroaches stand out even more.

480
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,780
Like hair clips on her head.

481
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,060
He must think my head is always

482
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,780
full of fancy hair clips.

483
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,060
Someone is definitely playing a prank on you.

484
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,580
Is it you?

485
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,780
Are you the one pranking her?

486
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,620
I just love you.

487
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm not a bad person.

488
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,260
I'm very jealous.

489
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,340
What does this number mean?

490
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Four hundred and five.

491
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,140
Is it the sound of screaming?

492
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,380
You didn't go over 450.

493
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,100
This is a candy production workshop.

494
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,460
What does this mean?

495
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,740
Why are there so many cockroaches?

496
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,260
What are all these things?

497
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,660
And also,

498
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,700
Just now, was it...

499
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,940
Did this 450 score go up?

500
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,500
Really?
Yes.

501
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,940
Every time she gets pranked, the score goes up.

502
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,140
Is that for real?
It's possible.

503
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,860
Try it again.

504
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,660
Come on, spray me once.

505
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
Stand a bit closer.

506
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,620
Really?

507
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,900
It's really possible.

508
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,060
It's five hundred and four now.

509
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,620
It will increase.

510
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,860
Really.

511
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,940
Is that so?

512
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,820
So that means...

513
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,260
The boss has this kind of quirk, right?

514
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,220
Playing tricks on people.

515
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,580
This boss is so weird.

516
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,980
So only the boss can control the scoring.

517
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,380
But the boss is dead now.

518
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,740
Then let's look for other clues.

519
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,260
Okay.

520
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,660
Are there any other clues?

521
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,260
You look around here.

522
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Check the shelves carefully.

523
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
You're so tall, you...

524
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,980
Wait, there's something here.

525
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,460
This

526
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,460
Don't let me find any

527
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,700
Something related to you

528
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,180
What is this?

529
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,620
Crystal slipper

530
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,300
You are the brightest star in my heart

531
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,180
Meeting you

532
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,380
Ke An looks

533
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,820
What are you stepping on?
Wait a moment.

534
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,380
What are you stepping on?

535
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,580
Ke'an, look.

536
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,140
This

537
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,740
Every time I see you

538
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,460
it sweeps away all my fatigue from the day

539
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,580
My life is rich and wonderful because of you

540
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,580
Bai Huanzi

541
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:40,860
Say something

542
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,380
Bai Huanzi

543
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,100
Bai Huanzi

544
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,380
You guys

545
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,500
are amazing

546
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,740
You gave a spittoon as a gift

547
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,700
This is a drinking cup

548
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,220
Bai Huanzi

549
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,700
And it even has the "double happiness" character

550
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:01,900
Yes.
Bai Huanzi

551
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,220
Who did I write this for?

552
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,740
That must have been written for our Bafentang.

553
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Not me.

554
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,700
Ke Ankan

555
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,060
Who did you give it to?

556
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,220
I don't know either.

557
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,700
Let's talk about these two first.

558
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,260
What's going on?

559
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,020
I'm a heartthrob.

560
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,580
You're all chasing after me.

561
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,180
There should be some love triangles today.

562
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,220
Strange things.

563
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,620
My Bafentang.

564
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,580
Your what?

565
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,340
There are only a few men in the factory.

566
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,660
Ke Ankan

567
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,740
Bai Huanzi

568
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,180
You're no longer in this story.

569
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,940
Why does my heart hurt?

570
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,660
You might just be one of them.

571
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,580
So basically,

572
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,980
these two men both like you.

573
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,420
And this one too.

574
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,020
And this one too.

575
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,100
Did you give any gifts?

576
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:16,820
You?

577
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,980
You only talk.

578
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,020
You never actually do anything.

579
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,100
The other two gave gifts.

580
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,300
The other two gave gifts.
The other two gave gifts.
The other two gave gifts.

581
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,180
You do nothing.

582
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,500
You liar.

583
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,220
Actually, he has done some things.

584
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,660
Some rather sweet gestures.

585
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,820
Compared to the cheesy gifts the other two gave,

586
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,620
He thinks the two of us are tacky.

587
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,260
He would take this net bag

588
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,860
and turn it around for me like this.

589
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,260
So after he turns it around,

590
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,940
he writes something on it.

591
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,340
Or draws little hearts or something.

592
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
Because of this, we get complaints from customers.

593
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,180
They complain about us.

594
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,860
So I have to wipe it off.

595
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,500
And put on a new one.

596
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
He's just causing you trouble.

597
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,180
What do you know?

598
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,500
You're causing trouble for others.

599
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,220
You really...

600
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,820
Who do you like?

601
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,380
Doesn't trouble bring about feelings?

602
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
I don't have anyone I like.

603
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,620
Because

604
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
it hurts.

605
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,900
My heart isn't in this.

606
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,460
"Player"

607
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,540
I'm not interested.

608
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
"Player"

609
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,140
How does this make me a "player"?

610
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,300
So not liking someone makes me a "player"?

611
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,620
Soon, others will see

612
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,940
your "player" side.

613
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,100
She doesn't love you.

614
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,820
Wait, what's this?

615
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,500
Bracelet

616
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,220
The first issue of "Tui City Weekly"

617
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,380
Popular streamer Da Tianjie

618
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,020
Deeply embroiled in the "Runny Mooncake" public controversy

619
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,780
Who is this person?

620
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,660
Da Tianjie is a streamer

621
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,060
I know

622
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,460
No

623
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,060
Might as well not have said anything.

624
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,500
This is my older sister.

625
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,940
She's your sister?

626
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,140
Yes, she's my sister.

627
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,300
Her name is Quantang.

628
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,500
The two of us grew up supporting each other.

629
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,780
My sister is also very good-looking.

630
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,980
She's also very eloquent.

631
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,660
So she became a livestream host.

632
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,860
She made a lot of money.

633
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,340
And then she...
Started selling products online, right?

634
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,820
Yes, selling products.
Okay, a product-selling host.

635
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,300
Then...
After making a lot of money,

636
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,340
she got carried away.

637
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,860
She wanted to start her own business and open a factory.

638
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,700
She started making those "Tangxin Mooncakes."

639
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,340
Yes.
But...

640
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,380
Even though she's my sister,
I still have to say,

641
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,340
she's lost her conscience.

642
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,700
Because as she made more and more money,

643
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,420
she started thinking

644
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
she could use the lowest costs

645
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,260
to make the most money.

646
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,700
So she used some

647
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,740
not-so-great ingredients

648
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,540
to make these "Tangxin Mooncakes."

649
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,860
Then some customers started complaining.

650
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,980
So
she then

651
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,500
was sentenced to prison.

652
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,540
She was in prison for three years, then she was released.

653
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,420
She’s already out of prison.
Yes.

654
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,060
But during her time in prison,

655
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,740
she developed some mental issues.

656
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,500
What’s going on with this photo?

657
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,540
It’s from a report.
That’s the boss in the background.

658
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,820
The boss is standing behind her.

659
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,420
What does this mean?

660
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,260
This is a reporter.

661
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,060
That’s not my sister.

662
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,140
It’s a reporter.

663
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,460
Yes, it’s a reporter.

664
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,620
She was interviewing at this sanatorium.

665
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,060
A mental hospital.

666
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,660
And that’s our boss in the background.

667
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,900
Why would he be there?

668
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,420
Why do I have this photo?

669
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,060
Why?

670
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,620
I mentioned earlier

671
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,860
that my sister had some mental health issues.

672
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,060
Her condition

673
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,220
was actually slowly improving.

674
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,260
But just at that time,

675
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,420
bad news came.

676
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,780
They said she jumped off a building.

677
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,020
My sister jumped.

678
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,260
Your sister jumped?

679
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,100
Yes.

680
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,220
Yes, my sister is already dead.

681
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,260
She already jumped.

682
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,380
But because of her jumping off the building,

683
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,540
I found it very

684
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,820
suspicious.

685
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,300
Then I asked for a screenshot.

686
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,460
Then I got this screenshot.

687
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,900
I saw this boss.

688
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,060
And I recognized him.

689
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,060
He is my sister's top supporter.

690
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,260
So the reason you came here is to

691
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,780
investigate

692
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,940
Yes

693
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,620
So this is

694
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,780
Because he was my sister's top supporter,

695
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,420
he also sent my sister

696
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,260
a gift by mail.

697
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,860
The address was this candy factory.

698
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,620
That's how I found this place.

699
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,580
I've been here ever since,

700
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,700
able to secretly watch

701
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,460
the boss entering the password.

702
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,740
So you know

703
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,020
the password to the boss's office, right?

704
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,580
Yes.

705
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,980
After I learned his password,

706
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,860
I snuck into his office.

707
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,900
I found out

708
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,460
he was hiding my sister's magazine

709
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,380
and this bracelet

710
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,940
and the bracelet was already broken

711
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,540
so my thought is

712
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,260
maybe at that time

713
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,980
when he pushed my sister down the stairs

714
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,340
during the struggle

715
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,740
he pulled my sister's bracelet

716
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,820
then I

717
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,980
went to his

718
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,580
that platform

719
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,220
to check out his profile and stuff

720
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,820
he posts things like luxury cars

721
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,500
and big watches

722
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,820
and some pretty girls

723
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,220
videos of pretty girls

724
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,820
I feel like he's some kind of pervert

725
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,540
so the prank he played on her was

726
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
making it a livestream

727
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,660
a livestream

728
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,260
did he prank her and send her tips?

729
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,660
that's possible, it could be

730
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,220
so all of us have

731
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,140
this rating system

732
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,380
so is everyone being livestreamed?

733
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,300
Alright.

734
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,980
Then let's go to the next place.

735
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,420
Let's go.
Next.

736
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,780
Then we should go to the boys' dormitory.

737
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,620
Okay, let's go.

738
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,620
Come on, to the living area.

739
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,460
Whose dorm should we visit first?

740
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,860
The boys' dorm.

741
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,020
This is the dorm of real men.

742
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,060
A real man's dorm.
My dorm.

743
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,620
Let's search Ke'an's place first.

744
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,740
Wait a second.

745
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,500
You stand by the door for now.

746
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,620
Why?

747
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,820
To avoid suspicion.

748
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,540
Alright.

749
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,540
His wall is covered with

750
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,460
all games.

751
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,500
Tell me.

752
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Since I was a child, I've had a

753
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,500
dream of becoming a gaming expert.

754
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,540
I want to go pro.

755
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,580
Go pro in gaming? Okay.

756
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,540
But my grandma

757
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,500
has always thought that playing games

758
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,740
can't really bring anything

759
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,100
of real value to your life.

760
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,420
Yeah, being a security guard is more promising.

761
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,340
No.

762
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,739
How can you say that?

763
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,500
Maybe older people prefer stable jobs.

764
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,100
Like social insurance and benefits.
Right.

765
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,340
But let me tell you,
I've been through it.

766
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,300
I'm an electrician now.

767
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,139
I'm telling you,

768
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,860
when people are fifty or sixty,

769
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,380
their final goal is to become a security guard.

770
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,340
So you skipped thirty years of detours.

771
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,420
You're already a security guard now.

772
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,179
You should say that to my grandma.

773
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:53,980
That's right.

774
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,219
What is this?

775
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,980
Broken sword.
So scary.

776
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,580
This is the bed Ke'an looked at, right?

777
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,100
Yes, that's right.
Come on, let's take a look first.

778
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,739
Let's check his bed.

779
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,659
Sleep with me.

780
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,100
How can he be like this?

781
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,340
Nest
Sleep in my nest

782
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:18,500
What do you mean, sleep with you? Sleep with him.

783
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,139
Sleep in my nest

784
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:22,139
Sleep in my nest

785
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,140
Lie down for a bit

786
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,740
I'll do it

787
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,660
Push and check

788
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,220
How can they make us do this job?

789
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I'll push and check, I have to

790
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,100
Lie on it

791
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,420
Lie on it

792
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,500
Hit someone

793
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,460
I'm afraid there might be some prank

794
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,340
There definitely is, there's a scoreboard here

795
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,140
Will just sleeping once really help?

796
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,460
It's not that simple.

797
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,860
Hurry up and say it.

798
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,020
You just need to imitate it.

799
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,740
This hero's line.

800
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,140
The sword of the great river descends from the heavens.

801
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,780
The sword of the great river descends from the heavens.

802
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,020
There's a secret passage.

803
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,500
We can go in.

804
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,700
The score went up.

805
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,700
Finally did the job a deduction detective is supposed to do.

806
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,180
I won't go out for now.

807
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,060
Hurry.

808
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,500
It's like a bug inside.

809
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,340
What is it?

810
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,420
Is that his promotional photo?

811
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,020
So handsome.

812
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,580
This refreshing young man.

813
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,980
What is this?

814
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,940
You tell me what's going on first.

815
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,300
What do you mean, what's going on?

816
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,780
What do you mean by "what's going on"?

817
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,780
Inside here,

818
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,540
I accidentally discovered a space.

819
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,580
How did you find it?

820
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,460
I have a lot of these posted on my wall.

821
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,500
Heroes I like to play.

822
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,740
Usually, I lie here.

823
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,260
I like to imitate their lines.

824
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,300
One day, when I was shouting,

825
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,100
it suddenly triggered this mechanism.

826
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,140
That's how I got inside.

827
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,660
This is his phone.

828
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,940
There are also some videos.

829
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,380
If you could ease up on the lava a bit, big bro.

830
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,340
Didn't a while ago there come out a

831
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,140
really good movie called "Nezha"?

832
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,100
Big bro is already prepared.

833
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
What kind of pose is that?

834
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,660
If you could ease up on the lava a bit, big bro.

835
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,740
If you could ease up on the lava a bit, big bro.

836
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,700
We are willing to serve loyally.

837
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,700
You're amazing.

838
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,060
It's like being back in the cinema.

839
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,940
You do one.

840
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,580
Mature woman's voice.

841
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,740
If you could lower the intensity of the magma a bit, big brother,

842
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,940
We are willing to serve with utmost loyalty.

843
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,980
Not bad either.

844
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,660
That works.
Alright.

845
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
Take a look at this, everyone.

846
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Game sharing group.

847
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,020
Kean says, guys,

848
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,380
let's share good stuff.

849
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,260
Just reposting
Someone in the next group said

850
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,260
Are there any new skins lately?

851
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,220
Ke An said, I just finished reposting

852
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,580
Let me show you my big treasure

853
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,860
What kind of big treasure are you showing people?

854
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,020
Skins

855
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,620
Hello

856
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,820
This is NZL Esports Club

857
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,340
You have received

858
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,100
NZL reserve player qualification

859
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,780
After approval, we will have a video call with you

860
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
to conduct the final interview

861
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,980
If the video call is not connected

862
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,140
it will be considered as giving up this opportunity

863
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,500
Got it

864
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,700
The account is woshiyewang

865
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Yewang

866
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,940
Yewang

867
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,260
Confidentiality agreement

868
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,340
Read it out

869
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,340
Party A, the commissioning party, is Tuitian Food Factory

870
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Party B, the receiving party, is Ke Ankan

871
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,940
Tuitian Food Factory Confidentiality Agreement

872
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,220
Party B must not disclose

873
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,860
any information within the above scope

874
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,540
and is strictly prohibited from

875
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,260
conducting any recording activities in the factory work area

876
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,340
Otherwise, it will be considered a business leak.

877
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,220
You will have to compensate the company one million.

878
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,620
That one million was crossed out, right?

879
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,940
Why did you take that one million?

880
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,500
Here's what happened.

881
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,820
We're not allowed to bring phones as employees.

882
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,740
The club replied to me.

883
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,460
They wanted to video call me.

884
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,940
So I secretly,

885
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,380
brought my phone while on duty.

886
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,580
As a security guard, you—

887
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,300
No wonder people could get in.

888
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,860
Not doing your job.

889
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,980
Slacking off at work.

890
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,820
At that time, the boss

891
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,620
thought I was recording a video.

892
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,180
But actually,

893
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,260
I was on a video call with my club.

894
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,660
I also passed their interview and assessment.

895
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,500
Right, but they had one condition—

896
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,180
If you want to play professionally at our club,

897
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,060
as a player,

898
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,580
you can't have any personal legal disputes.

899
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,820
So you killed the boss.

900
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Because you owed him one million.
That's right.

901
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,980
How about that?

902
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,700
There's your motive for murder.

903
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,900
First, for the money.

904
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,100
Second, for your dream.

905
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,900
You had to do it.
Yes.

906
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,100
Isn't that right?
Yes.

907
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,380
You know I had to do it too.

908
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,260
You agree, don't you?

909
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,540
That I should have done it.

910
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,220
Alright.

911
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,100
Alright.
Let's start searching.

912
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,180
Heniba.

913
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,780
I want to ask what this is.

914
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,820
This is mine.

915
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,860
This week's goal.

916
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,060
What does five times ninety-nine mean?

917
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,820
That red fitness ring

918
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,780
can only be done ninety-nine times

919
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,100
no more, no less, for five rounds

920
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,740
there's a counter

921
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,820
it has a counter on it

922
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,900
Can you do it or not?

923
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,740
Don't you think I look really energetic like this?

924
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,180
Like this, faster.

925
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,060
Yes, squat down.

926
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,180
I'm flying!

927
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,700
Can you do it or not?
I can.

928
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,780
Like this, faster.

929
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:48,940
Yes.

930
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,020
You passed.
Passed.

931
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,340
If you pass one, you have to start over.

932
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,300
Really?
Who said that?

933
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,380
It's true.
Yes.

934
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,820
Then let's do it again.

935
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,220
You're amazing.

936
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,060
Impressive.

937
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,220
You can tell you work out regularly.

938
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,780
Look at some people.

939
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,660
So impressive.

940
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,500
A security guard is really something.

941
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,260
Truly extraordinary.

942
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,300
It's done.
Quick, let me send it to you.

943
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,940
Send.
I've done two.

944
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm a welder.

945
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,180
My arms can't get too tired.

946
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,820
Why can't a welder's arms get tired?

947
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,180
I'm a skilled worker.

948
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,860
Then why can a security guard's arms get tired?

949
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,900
Because you need to train your arms.

950
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,820
Okay.
Impressive.

951
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,620
Very rhythmic.
About to take off.

952
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
You're about to take off.

953
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,380
It feels like you're on a motorcycle.

954
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,660
You're pedaling over there.

955
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,100
You need to keep the rhythm.

956
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,340
I'm telling you, the more you talk, the faster it gets.

957
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,460
Give a couple more words of encouragement.

958
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,580
So strong.

959
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,220
Awesome.

960
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,420
Yuning, Yuning.

961
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,020
Really the best.

962
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,180
Okay.
Ninety-nine.

963
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,180
The light sign is here.

964
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,060
It's just to find out that you like her.

965
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,780
So all of us were busy for so long,

966
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,580
just to help him confess his feelings.

967
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,540
Passionate and sweet, like candy.

968
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Always in love.

969
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,780
The evening breeze carries your smile, so innocent and naive.

970
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,700
A tiny part of my heart is reflected in your eyes.

971
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,060
What?

972
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,860
This is so cute.

973
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,300
This is so cute.

974
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,340
Let me tell you,

975
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,780
this man is so unreliable.

976
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,620
He uses this crappy cardboard

977
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,060
to try and fool us girls.

978
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,580
No.

979
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,220
Some people buy into this.

980
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,420
Some people don't buy into this.

981
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,420
It really depends on the person.

982
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,100
Okay, got it.
Do you buy into this?

983
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,140
I'm asking you, do you?

984
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,340
I don't buy into anyone's tricks.

985
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
What?

986
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,860
I do.

987
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,380
I want to.

988
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,660
Check your phone.

989
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:31,940
Employment contract.

990
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,820
Why are you taking a picture of my employment contract?

991
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,700
He took a picture of my employment contract.

992
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:39,780
Work.

993
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,580
Is he helping you terminate your contract?

994
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,260
There's another order form.

995
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,780
Supplier: an unlicensed factory.

996
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,300
An unlicensed factory.

997
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,020
An unlicensed factory refers to

998
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,780
This boss

999
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,060
The candy he sells

1000
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,860
is not the candy we produce.

1001
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,780
Instead, it's from an unlicensed manufacturer.

1002
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,780
He ordered a batch of unlicensed candy

1003
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,740
and sold it to consumers.

1004
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,460
It was packaged as Herlimu Jinyu candy.

1005
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,980
Because once I noticed

1006
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,740
there was a very suspicious person outside.

1007
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,820
He wasn't an employee of our factory.

1008
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,900
But he was transporting our goods.

1009
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,540
He took our packaged candy

1010
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,460
and separated the packaging from the candy.

1011
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,220
The candy was sent back to the factory.

1012
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,620
The packaging came back to me.

1013
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,380
They asked me to repackage it.

1014
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,300
So the candy and the packaging

1015
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,220
kept being reused over and over.

1016
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,260
Our factory is actually operating fraudulently.

1017
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,460
The factory is falsifying its accounts.

1018
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,660
In a fit of rage,

1019
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,700
I tore this thing apart.

1020
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,740
Then I discovered that the box I used to make the support sign

1021
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,940
had a hidden compartment.

1022
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,540
Inside was a box for "Tangxin Mooncakes."

1023
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,500
So, at that time, the "Tangxin Mooncakes"

1024
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,500
during Sweet Sister's livestream,

1025
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,860
the mooncakes involved in the incident back then

1026
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,300
were made by this boss.

1027
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,460
It's all connected now.

1028
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,140
Yes.

1029
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,180
So it wasn't your sister's fault.

1030
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,100
You didn't know about this?

1031
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,820
You've been investigating the boss for so long.

1032
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,740
You don't know about the "Tangxin Mooncakes"?

1033
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,660
I don't know.

1034
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,740
Your sister was wrongly imprisoned.

1035
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,300
Yes.

1036
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,140
Three years ago,

1037
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,380
I dropped out of school to start a business.

1038
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,420
I was looking for a job that suited me.

1039
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,460
Then I found Sister Datian's livestream.

1040
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,220
And then I saw her

1041
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,020
"Tangxin Mooncakes"
were selling really well.

1042
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,500
So I stocked up on a lot of them.

1043
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,380
But right after I stocked up,

1044
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,020
the "Tangxin Mooncakes" were found to be poisonous.

1045
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,940
Did you buy so many because you like eating them,

1046
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,860
or were you planning to resell them?
I wanted to resell them.

1047
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,740
Then Sister Datian got arrested.

1048
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,180
And all the mooncakes I stocked up on

1049
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,620
couldn't be sold anymore.

1050
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,660
So I lost a lot of money.

1051
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,420
So you used this to threaten him.

1052
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,660
You wanted the boss to give you money.

1053
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,020
What?

1054
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,060
No, I didn't.
Not yet, at least.

1055
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,620
Yes.

1056
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,940
What? There is?

1057
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,180
This was found inside his doll.
It was discovered there.

1058
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,500
There's also another order form.

1059
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,700
Supplier: an unregistered factory.

1060
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,660
Someone told him,

1061
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,740
Heniba, let me tell you,

1062
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,580
don't think you can avoid paying back just by hiding.

1063
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,900
Our patience with you has run out.

1064
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,060
It's been three months—are you going to pay or not?

1065
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,020
If you don't pay within ten days,

1066
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,100
the interest will keep piling up.

1067
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,220
This is called Gaolidai Company.

1068
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,860
Then he borrowed from Gaolidai and still couldn't pay it back.

1069
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,180
So he was forced to work at the factory.

1070
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,100
As a result, a lot of young girls really liked me.

1071
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,940
But I only liked her.

1072
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,540
I sent her pictures of my muscles every day.

1073
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,380
And videos of me dancing.

1074
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,380
So gross.

1075
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,540
He even sent muscle photos.

1076
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,660
Right, so he owed money outside.

1077
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,260
Then he discovered the company's secret.

1078
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,020
He used the secret to threaten the boss.

1079
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,180
Blackmail.

1080
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,260
It's true that I threatened the boss.

1081
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,540
But I threatened the boss to save her.

1082
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,660
It wasn't for myself.

1083
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,340
Didn't you ask for money?

1084
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,460
You asked for some money while you were at it.

1085
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,020
You wanted both money and to save her.

1086
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,660
Hello.

1087
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,340
You're so greedy.

1088
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,340
You want both money and love.

1089
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,700
Money and love.

1090
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,100
If I don't have money,
how can I support her?

1091
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,740
So did you get the money?

1092
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,860
No, I didn't.

1093
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,660
He died.
So you killed him.

1094
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,020
I didn't even get the money.

1095
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,380
Why would I kill him?

1096
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,820
Out of anger and humiliation.

1097
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,700
There's also a tablet here.

1098
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,300
So handsome.

1099
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,100
How could I do it again and again?

1100
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,620
I'm stunned by how handsome you are.

1101
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,660
Check your WeChat.

1102
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,060
Bafentang

1103
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,500
He sent it to Bafentang.

1104
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,660
What did he say?

1105
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,180
Street dance boy
Let me take a look.

1106
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,660
No, that's him.

1107
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,020
Yeah.
That's me.

1108
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,420
Street dance boy.
It really is you.

1109
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,980
This is what I'm most proud of.

1110
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,180
A dance video.

1111
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,940
Taming my limbs.

1112
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,740
This is for the person I like.

1113
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,940
It's meant for them to see.

1114
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,980
Why should you get to see it?

1115
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,780
You don't deserve to see it.

1116
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,340
We're just trying to learn.

1117
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,180
How you go after girls.

1118
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:21,700
No way.

1119
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,100
Go play somewhere else.

1120
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,500
Did you notice his details?

1121
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,620
So, the five of us stand in a line.

1122
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,340
Then we all jump together.

1123
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,500
Then let him see how it goes.

1124
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,420
First, you have to keep a straight face.

1125
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,220
Second,

1126
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,940
Second, you need to pout your lips.

1127
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,660
You actually looked pretty cool at the end.

1128
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,220
You need to step down.
Right.

1129
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,340
Pretty cocky, too.

1130
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,100
Come on.

1131
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,900
One, two, three, four.

1132
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,300
Five, six, seven, eight.

1133
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,900
What about the last one?

1134
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,340
Yeah.

1135
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,580
Okay, three, two, one.

1136
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,700
Done.

1137
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,860
I did it.

1138
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,580
Let's just end it.

1139
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,580
He sent this to Bafentang.

1140
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,060
Expressing love through dance, right?

1141
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,220
Like a peacock showing its feathers.

1142
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,980
Bafentang praised me.

1143
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,620
Said this place is pretty weird.

1144
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,500
How about we both quit and leave this place?

1145
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,660
I suggest that when you talk to others in the future,

1146
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,260
just speak properly.

1147
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,580
Don't send videos, okay?

1148
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,020
There's something even crazier, look.

1149
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,260
Then Bafentang said,

1150
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,380
If I don't work, will you support me?

1151
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,540
I can't leave this place.

1152
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,980
You should stay here with me too.

1153
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,060
I can't either.

1154
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,660
Did I say that?

1155
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,820
What year is this?

1156
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,740
This year.

1157
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,340
What else is in here

January 31, 2025

1162
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,060
About to be drawn

1163
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,580
This period's winning numbers are

00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,460
Number 1

1165
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,380

This period's special number is

1170
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,820
Number 52

1171
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,860
What does this mean?
What are you doing?

1172
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,420
Gambling.
He buys lottery tickets every day.

1173
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,060
He likes to gamble.
Gambler.

1174
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,220
Even though I'm a muscular porter,

1175
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,260
but I am

1176
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,660
the only one in our factory

1177
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,260
who graduated from Tuizhen University.

1178
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,460
And usually,

1179
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,740
I take some people from the factory

1180
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,100
to make some investments.

1181
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,820
This is called investing.
This is called speculation.

1182
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,340
I manage these things.

1183
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,220
Over time, I became

1184
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,540
a gambler.

1185
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,780
A small-time bookie.

1186
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,460
You're the bookie?

1187
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,940
You...

1188
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,260
Impressive.

1189
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,180
I just help out.

1190
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,140
I just take a small cut.

1191
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,060
There are muscle photos.

1192
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,820
January 10, 2025.

1193
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,780
Twelve o'clock.

1194
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,100
Bafentang takes the initiative to talk to Heniba.

1195
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,100
Hello, Heniba.
I'm Bafentang.

1196
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,580
The sweetest one in the factory.

1197
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,420
Take a look.

1198
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,380
This damn charm

1199
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,620
Then on January 25, 2025

1200
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,100
at 6 p.m.

1201
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,300
She said, Heniba

1202
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,260
You look so cool moving goods with one hand

1203
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,380
Can you make your biceps even bigger?

1204
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,300
Then I’d definitely like you even more

1205
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,500
Then he went to practice.

1206
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,340
Next

1207
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,380
Ke Ankan

1208
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,220
Is this how you play detective?

1209
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,260
Is this how you spank him?

1210
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,820
Why do you always want to spank me?

1211
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,580
No

1212
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,780
No

1213
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,060
That was amazing
Stop playing, go sit down

1214
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,500
Okay, Ke Ankan

1215
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,140
Tell that Heniba

1216
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,420
You better stay away from Bafentang

1217
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,020
She's the woman I like

1218
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,460
Stop hitting

1219
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
Don't think just because you have some muscles

1220
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,780
you can beat me

1221
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,580
If you have the guts, let's spar

1222
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,500
Did you send this?

1223
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,700
Ke Ankan, did you send this?

1224
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,660
I don't remember this

1225
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,780
You don't remember this?

1226
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,620
I beat you up and you don't remember?

1227
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,700
I remember you hit me.
But it was because of this.

1228
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,540
You don't remember.
No.

1229
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,500
After you hit me, you just...

1230
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,900
No.

1231
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,420
You two fought because of me.

1232
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,580
You don't remember.

1233
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,020
No.
When you don't remember...

1234
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,780
Listen to me.

1235
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,580
Why did you start fighting?

1236
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,380
Because of you.

1237
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,580
Because of you.

1238
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,500
Because of you.
Wait a second.

1239
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,820
Wait a second.

1240
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,740
He really did hit me.

1241
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,060
Don't look so smug.

1242
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,540
And say something so pathetic, okay?

1243
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,380
He really did hit me.

1244
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,140
Alright, fine.

1245
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,940
Because the two of us have always

1246
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,700
been pretty well-behaved.

1247
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,780
We've never crossed the line.

1248
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,060
Well-behaved.

1249
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,620
Why didn't you join this duel?

1250
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,020
You even gave me that

1251
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,380
phlegm.

1252
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,900
I honestly have no idea

1253
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,380
why he hit me that day.

1254
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,220
I think he's got issues.

1255
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,340
I'll spar with him another day.

1256
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,020
That's what I meant.
What he means is

1257
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,780
he doesn't know he sent that message.

1258
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,340
Yeah.
What?

1259
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,380
Did a lot of you

1260
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,860
not even know you sent those texts?

1261
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,860
I know.

1262
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:11,620
No.

1263
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,220
Do you know you sent it?

1264
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,460
But you don't remember.

1265
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,740
You said something like that to him.

1266
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,900
I don't really remember.

1267
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,420
So someone could log into our account.

1268
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,380
And send messages.
That's right.

1269
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,700
Now that's suspicious.
Exactly.

1270
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,460
Okay.
Alright.

1271
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,700
So what was your motive for murder?

1272
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,300
You guys are asking me?

1273
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,140
What's a good person's motive for murder?

1274
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,820
Your voice is cracking.

1275
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,580
What's wrong with you?

1276
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,900
It's all clear now.

1277
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,660
He stockpiled

1278
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,140
500,000 worth of this Gaolidai.

1279
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,340
It made him miserable.

1280
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,300
It's this "Tangxin Mooncake".
That "Tangxin Mooncake" boss.

1281
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,300
I'm not miserable either.

1282
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,900
There are still lots of young girls who like me every day.

1283
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,700
Why would I be miserable?

1284
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,700
Your happiness is so simple.

1285
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,340
Yeah, girls like me every day.

1286
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,900
I dance at home every day.

1287
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,180
It's so relaxing.

1288
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,740
Okay.

1289
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,940
Doing street dance every day feels great.

1290
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Maybe I got hurt by him by accident.

1291
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,460
Got hurt by mistake.

1292
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,700
Go out, bro.

1293
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,860
Bro was practicing dance in the hallway.

1294
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,140
At that time, he slapped me twice.

1295
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:09,820
No.

1296
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,260
He might have been walking forward with headphones on.

1297
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:11,660
Like this.

1298
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,020
Yes.

1299
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,860
Isn't that exactly the move?

1300
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,220
Alright, that's one way too.

1301
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,580
Even I don't know myself.

1302
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,020
So ruthless.

1303
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,660
So your motive for killing is

1304
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,860
because you wanted to save her.

1305
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,180
And then you killed that boss.

1306
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,540
No.

1307
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,700
Actually, I don't love her that much anymore.

1308
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,860
Alright.

1309
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,900
His happiness is very simple.

1310
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,660
Anyway, lots of young girls like him.

1311
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,060
You're not special.

1312
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:38,540
Yes.

1313
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,460
No.

1314
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,300
He already hated this boss.

1315
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,700
Because that's his past.

1316
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,140
Yes.

1317
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,980
It made his life turn out this way.

1318
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,900
Yes, his whole life became like this.
It ruined the rest of his life.

1319
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,460
Alright.
Actually, it's all of them.

1320
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,380
All of them.

1321
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,380
Forget it.

1322
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,420
It's too late.

1323
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,940
I don't fall for anyone's tricks.

1324
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,220
Alright, our next evidence search location is us.

1325
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,260
The Golden Ladle's kitchen.

1326
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,460
This is the cafeteria, this is your place.

1327
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,860
That's right.

1328
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,260
Everyone, feel free to look around.

1329
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,540
Why is your kitchen not warm at all?

1330
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,420
Could you cook us a bowl of noodles?

1331
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,020
Or maybe...

1332
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,260
I'll heat it up for you in a bit.

1333
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,060
There's a secret passage.

1334
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,140
Where does this passage lead?

1335
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,620
Sneak out and kill someone.

1336
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,500
Then sneak back in through here.

1337
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,380
This is the food delivery hatch.
Let me explain.

1338
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,980
We have a sterile operating room.

1339
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,860
That's a place we can't access.

1340
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,740
There are staff there too.

1341
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,300
I have to cook for them every day.

1342
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,100
So their meals

1343
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,380
I just put them in here.

1344
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,060
And send them over.
Have you ever been there?

1345
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,140
Have you ever sent yourself in?

1346
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,220
Occasionally.

1347
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,340
Then I get sent back.

1348
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,660
Because she has germs.

1349
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,420
The door up ahead should be locked.

1350
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,620
So how do we open this door now?

1351
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,540
Let Bai Dadan do it.
I'll give it a try.

1352
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:28,660
Be careful.

1353
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,460
No.

1354
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,420
It's locked. The outside is locked.

1355
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,580
There's a possibility.

1356
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,940
Maybe after this door is closed,

1357
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,380
the other side will open.
It's possible. Let's try.

1358
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:42,980
Wait a moment.

1359
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,100
Push the probe up there.

1360
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,140
Push the probe.

1361
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,300
I can't do it. You try.

1362
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:48,940
I'll do it then.
Just in case.

1363
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,940
I can't climb up. It's too high.
You guys do it.

1364
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,420
Done.
Come.

1365
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,460
It's closed.

1366
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,540
Is it open?

1367
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:04,900
Is it open?

1368
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,100
Is it open?

1369
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,740
It won't open.

1370
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,180
It won't open.

1371
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,100
Look.

1372
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,820
Try moving it up, down, left, and right.

1373
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,500
It's no use.

1374
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,060
There must be some kind of trigger mechanism.

1375
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,020
There must be some kind of trigger mechanism.

1376
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,620
I just put their food in here.

1377
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,100
Put a serving of food inside.

1378
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,460
Put a serving of food in.

1379
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,860
Try putting a serving of food inside.

1380
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,140
You carry a bowl.

1381
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,300
Are you okay?
You hold it.

1382
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,940
Letting Bai do something this silly.

1383
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,700
Putting food in doesn't work.

1384
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,820
There must be a mechanism.

1385
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,380
There's no mechanism, it doesn't exist.

1386
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,100
The question is, what kind of mechanism?

1387
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,300
How about this then?

1388
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,940
Let's search around first, okay?

1389
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,860
Okay.

1390
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,540
This garbage bag

1391
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,500
This garbage bag is so big

1392
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,660
So what if the trash bag is big?

1393
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,380
It could fit a person inside.

1394
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,780
Get in there.
Let me see if I can drag you away.

1395
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,980
Remember to put everything back after you're done.

1396
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,060
We're about to quit.

1397
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,340
And you still want us to put things back for you?

1398
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,260
And also

1399
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,580
What

1400
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,100
What is it

1401
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,500
What is this

1402
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,540
That voice recorder

1403
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,300
What?

1404
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,460
What does it mean to "turn the tables on him"?

1405
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,300
What does it mean to look for Tan and counterattack?

1406
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,020
Play it again.

1407
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,540
What a beautiful scene.

1408
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,380
Go find him.

1409
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,140
Look for him, Bold Tan.

1410
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,140
Look for Bold Tan.
Bold Tan.

1411
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,380
Bold Tan.

1412
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,260
What is this?

1413
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,780
There's something inside.

1414
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,660
Where did you get it?

1415
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,460
It's Boss Tan's.

1416
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,340
Why do you have it?

1417
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,860
I stole it.

1418
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,660
What's the password?

1419
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,340
I don't know.

1420
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,620
I can't open this box.

1421
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,220
This can't be taken out.

1422
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,740
Whose room is 141?

1423
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,140
There's a key.

1424
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,940
This key has 141 written on it.

1425
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,260
Excuse me.

1426
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,540
Key.

1427
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:10,660
Key

1428
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,140
Is this the key?

1429
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:13,620
Yes.

1430
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,940
It can open it.

1431
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,980
But this phone isn't mine.

1432
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,220
This is the boss's phone.
That's right.

1433
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,780
She has the boss's ID card.

1434
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,300
Let me bring the food over to you.

1435
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,140
You go ahead and analyze.

1436
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,340
I’ve brought you something to eat.

1437
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,500
This is your lunch.

1438
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,180
I made a Manchu-Han Imperial Feast for you.

1439
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,020
Okay.

1440
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,980
Let me talk about this box first.

1441
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,380
I found it in Boss Tan's office.

1442
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,380
I picked it up inside.

1443
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,100
I sneaked in and picked it up.

1444
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,460
This box, and inside there is a...

1445
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,380
A plant unique to Tui City is called the Gluttonous Yam.

1446
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,340
The Gluttonous Yam looks and tastes similar to a purple sweet potato.

1447
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,660
It is a toxic substance.

1448
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,620
Consuming a small amount of Gluttonous Yam often causes vomiting and diarrhea.

1449
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,260
It can cause symptoms such as green nasal bleeding.

1450
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,700
If consumed in excess,

1451
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,420
effective treatment must be administered promptly.

1452
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,900
Otherwise, it can be life-threatening.

1453
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,580
This is a type of food.

1454
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,500
Maybe some people don't know what it is.

1455
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,620
But if I mention one thing,

1456
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,940
you'll remember what it is.

1457
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,780
It's our "lava mooncake."

1458
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,220
Toxic substance

1459
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:48,580
Yes

1460
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,460
The "soft-centered mooncakes" from back then

1461
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,700
Why did people get poisoned?

1462
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,700
I've been investigating all along

1463
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,460
Later, I discovered that in the "soft-centered mooncakes"

1464
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,180
this substance was mixed in

1465
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,060
Gluttonous yam
Yes

1466
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,460
It looks a lot like a purple yam

1467
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,700
What is this?

1468
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,460
This, in our cafeteria

1469
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,940
every single thing you eat

1470
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,060
is my responsibility

1471
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,140
So it's impossible for anyone

1472
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,620
to accidentally eat anything bad

1473
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,660
But one day

1474
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,340
my beloved Bai Huanzi

1475
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,100
my beloved Bai Huanzi

1476
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,580
was actually convulsing there

1477
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,300
I realized he was poisoned by this gluttonous yam

1478
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,460
Yes

1479
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,780
But I know the gluttonous yam's

1480
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,740
antidote for this poison

1481
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,020
I immediately made soup for him.

1482
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,540
He still couldn't drink it.

1483
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,820
I told him, "Come on, don't be afraid."

1484
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,940
Here comes the little airplane.

1485
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,180
Only then did he do it.

1486
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,420
Here comes the little airplane.

1487
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,380
That's right.
Later, I threatened him and said,

1488
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,260
"Chug it all down, drink it up!"

1489
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:43,740
He gulped down two bowls.

1490
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,140
And then he was fine.

1491
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,260
After that, I think he probably

1492
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,060
started to have some feelings for me.

1493
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:49,740
That's right.

1494
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,540
Here's a phone.

1495
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,820
Let's take a look at this phone first.

1496
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,660
Bai Hanzi, can you come over for a moment?

1497
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,140
Bai Hanzi.
What is it?

1498
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,740
Bai Hanzi, are you confessing to me?

1499
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,180
You sent a message to Jin Tangshao.

1500
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,140
You said, "Jin Tangshao,"

1501
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,180
"Recently, my welding torch has been having some issues."

1502
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,060
"I can't weld iron anymore."
She asked you why.

1503
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,340
You said,

1504
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:10,300
"Because I only want to weld together with you."

1505
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:10,500
That's right.

1506
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,700
Why would you say something like that?

1507
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,500
None of your business.

1508
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,300
Bai Hanzi kept messaging her, saying,

1509
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,620
"My biggest dream in this life"

1510
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,420
"is to become the spoon in your hand,"

1511
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,580
"so I can see you every morning."

1512
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,980
You guys,

1513
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,460
There are only a few men in the factory.

1514
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,060
Who do you really love?

1515
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,420
Let me say this

1516
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,460
this phone

1517
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,260
has two screenshots of chat records inside

1518
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,700
This is the boss's phone

1519
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,100
The screenshots are from August 29, 2022

1520
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,540
Boss Tan and a

1521
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,140
close friend's chat record

1522
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,660
I didn't know about this

1523
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,460
because I couldn't open this box

1524
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,340
The first screenshot of the chat record

1525
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,380
Boss Tan said
Three days ago

1526
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,660
The new product from "Tangxin Food Factory"

1527
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,700
"Soft-centered mooncake" sample

1528
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,180
My father-in-law got sick after eating it.

1529
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,980
That's when I found out

1530
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,900
that the new, cheap ingredient we switched to

1531
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,460
called "Greedy Starch"

1532
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,100
is toxic.

1533
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,100
I also used this ingredient to make a batch of

1534
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,300
soft-centered candies.

1535
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,300
Now I can't sell them, they're just piling up.

1536
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,220
Boss Tan said, "Buddy,

1537
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,300
with our friendship, you have to help me."

1538
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,460
I have to find a way out of this.

1539
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,460
Now I want to change the legal representative of the company

1540
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,180
to my business partner who does the sales.

1541
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,940
My sister.

1542
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,140
She just used some

1543
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,020
not-so-great ingredients,

1544
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,820
and she was sentenced to prison.

1545
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
Anyway, she was the one selling the pre-ordered goods.

1546
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,860
When the time comes, I'll still ship the goods as usual.

1547
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,220
If anyone gets sick from eating them, it'll be her responsibility.

1548
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,020
Then he sent

1549
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,540
both sides of Quan Tang's ID card.

1550
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,940
The earlier the change date, the better.

1551
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,380
Also, get me a fake ID.

1552
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,140
So this is

1553
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,380
Boss Tan's real name.

1554
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,100
His name is

1555
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,260
Tan Dadan.

1556
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,860
He caused your sister's death.

1557
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,420
Boss Tan's real name is Tan Dadan.

1558
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:54,700
It wasn't me.

1559
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,620
It was all done by Tan Dadan.

1560
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,620
If something happened after receiving the goods, it's her fault too.

1561
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,780
He caused your sister's death.

1562
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,460
It was all done by Tan Dadan.

1563
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:02,780
Is that your sister's voice?

1564
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,260
Yes, that's my sister.

1565
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,180
Yes, it's your sister's voice.

1566
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,580
I can tell, I've watched her livestreams.

1567
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,900
The second top supporter.
Yes, the second top supporter.

1568
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,060
So this person went to find her for revenge.

1569
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,460
And then she...
It was me who went to find her.

1570
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,620
You went to find her?
Who did you go to find?

1571
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,260
Wait, what's the story?

1572
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,460
Because of the "Tangxin Mooncake" incident,

1573
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,620
I've been investigating all along.

1574
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,020
Why are you investigating?

1575
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,340
It's about your poisoned mooncakes.

1576
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,980
Who are you?

1577
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,540
What does it have to do with you?

1578
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,420
No matter what my identity is,

1579
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,620
as a citizen,

1580
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,060
if I am a consumer,

1581
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,180
if I get deceived,

1582
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,540
I have to defend my rights.

1583
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,540
To defend my rights, I can call the police.
Why do you need to find her?

1584
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,340
Right, you can report it.

1585
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:52,940
Yes.

1586
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,820
Wait, didn't she go to jail?

1587
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,980
But she was sentenced to three years and then released.

1588
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,900
I put on my black mink coat

1589
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,100
and sneak in.

1590
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,340
Sneak into that hospital.

1591
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,300
I said full sugar, tell me why.

1592
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,940
Why?

1593
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,500
So it was you.

1594
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:10,740
No.
She pinched me, sis.

1595
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,060
No, she didn't.

1596
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,940
She gently held her face like this and said,

1597
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:14,660
Why?

1598
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,500
She said it wasn't me.

1599
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,140
Go find Tan Dadan.

1600
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,980
So you know it's Tan Dadan.

1601
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:21,700
Yes.

1602
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,060
No, I don't think it's that simple.

1603
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,380
Did someone around you eat it?
Or did you eat it yourself?

1604
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,140
We need to search carefully.

1605
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:38,740
That...

1606
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,980
Behind that...

1607
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,540
Take a look at that flower.

1608
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,820
Why is it there?

1609
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,260
And that one...

1610
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,060
On the table.

1611
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:47,420
Table.

1612
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,420
On the table.

1613
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,260
What is this?

1614
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,100
Two zero zero

1615
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,340
There's something wrong, there are numbers on this.

1616
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,220
Two zero zero five six seven

1617
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,980
It's probably the production date.

1618
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,940
Take a look at that table.

1619
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,060
Tuitu Village Welfare Home

1620
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,940
You are the "Spoon Sister" at the welfare home.

1621
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,020
I'm an orphan too.

1622
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,060
And then?

1623
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,580
I grew up in the Tuichu Village orphanage.

1624
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,540
Our orphanage doesn't have any money.

1625
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,660
So each of us had very little to eat

1626
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,740
because there was so little food.

1627
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,940
When I grew up, I thought

1628
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,740
I must use the fewest ingredients

1629
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,979
to make the most delicious food.

1630
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:46,220
With just one shrimp,

1631
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,460
I could create a whole Manchu-Han feast.

1632
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,260
Seafood rice

1633
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:49,819
Later, I started working at this

1634
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,939
welfare home

1635
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,260
Everyone liked me very much

1636
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,819
I also liked those kids a lot

1637
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,580
Especially one of the kids

1638
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,460
His name was Little Mantou

1639
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,100
He loved eating my mantou the most

1640
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,779
He was always craving food and never felt full

1641
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:04,300
One year, I said that for this Mid-Autumn Festival

1642
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:06,859
I asked the welfare home for some money

1643
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:07,660
and got a bit of budget
to buy you all mooncakes

1644
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,819
It was during my livestream

1645
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,300
Play nine, deal eight.

1646
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,939
Play nine, deal eight.

1647
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,700
That's right.

1648
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,220
So a child died.

1649
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,260
After eating that poisoned mooncake.

1650
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:20,939
That's right.

1651
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,939
So that's your motive for murder.

1652
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:23,340
It holds up.

1653
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,020
Because you bought a custard mooncake.

1654
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,540
It poisoned the child.

1655
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,460
What's the most important thing we need to figure out right now?

1656
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,220
What were you doing during that time?

1657
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,500
Except for the two detectives,

1658
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,260
only they can question me.

1659
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,660
No one else should even think about interrogating me.

1660
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,500
Isn't this the great and just official himself?

1661
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,460
I think the biggest problem still lies

1662
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,540
with those two men.

1663
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,660
Let me lay it out for you clearly.

1664
01:09:58,660 --> 01:09:59,700
The timeline from this morning.

1665
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:02,740
I got up at 6:51.

1666
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,500
We both got up at the same time.

1667
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,740
Then at 6:55,

1668
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,540
I went to the bathroom to wash up.

1669
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,340
I washed up for about three minutes.

1670
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,700
I came out of the bathroom.

1671
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,580
I saw Heniba.

1672
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:16,140
At that time, he was about to go in.

1673
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,100
I had just finished, and he was about to go in.

1674
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,899
You saw him go into the bathroom with your own eyes?

1675
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:19,540
Yes, that's right.

1676
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,100
I saw him go into the bathroom with my own eyes.

1677
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,420
He didn't come back to the dorm until 7:10.

1678
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,460
Okay.

1679
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,420
At 6:57,

1680
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,340
I was delivering breakfast to everyone.

1681
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,460
After I finished, I went back to my room to rest.

1682
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,500
My schedule was

1683
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,740
getting up at 6:50,

1684
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,180
and then at 6:57,

1685
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,020
Jin Tangshao knocked on the door to deliver breakfast.

1686
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,980
Then at 7:15,

1687
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,340
I finished breakfast and went to the bathroom to wash up.

1688
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,460
At 7:30,

1689
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,060
I went back to my own room.

1690
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,820
The video we have from the workshop

1691
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,180
What time was the hammer strike?

1692
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,380
Seven o'clock.

1693
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,540
The process of committing the crime.

1694
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,300
Exactly seven o'clock.

1695
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,980
That is, fifty-seven.

1696
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,980
Fifty-eight.

1697
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,820
Someone came over at seven o'clock.

1698
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,420
The crime only took two to three minutes.

1699
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,500
Killing someone in two minutes.

1700
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:09,460
Three minutes.

1701
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,500
Actually, he had already passed out.

1702
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,220
Didn't you notice?
He just passed out.

1703
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,500
At that moment, he just hit him with a hammer.

1704
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,220
To deliver a fatal blow.

1705
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,860
Then he could just escape again.

1706
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:19,420
Right.
It was that one hit.

1707
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,220
Actually, it was just that one hit.

1708
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,220
First of all, the four of you

1709
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,220
all have

1710
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,460
A motive for murder.

1711
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:30,660
That's right.

1712
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,940
Bafentang's motive for murder

1713
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,540
is because she suspects Boss Tan Qian

1714
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,460
was responsible for her sister's death.

1715
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,060
She wants to avenge her sister.

1716
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:38,940
This is your motive for murder.

1717
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:40,820
Revenge.

1718
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,740
Mediating.

1719
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,300
Heniba.

1720
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,820
Mediating.

1721
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,140
Mediating

1722
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,620
Heniba wanted to

1723
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,140
because he knew some secrets about the boss

1724
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,260
and tried to blackmail him for money

1725
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:54,940
but the boss refused

1726
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,820
and ended up killing for money instead

1727
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,020
Personal vendetta

1728
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,500
As for our Ke'an

1729
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,180
he dreams of playing games

1730
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,060
and video chatting with others

1731
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,780
but the boss found out

1732
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,780
and demanded a million from him
Because of this contract

1733
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,700
he can't pursue his dream

1734
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,940
and can't join the club

1735
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,100
so he might have a motive to kill

1736
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:10,940
Debt
Right

1737
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,220
As for Jintangshao, this friend

1738
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,540
it's because in the past

1739
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,580
at the kindergarten where she lived

1740
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,300
there was a child

1741
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,500
who got poisoned after eating "soft-centered mooncakes"

1742
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:18,260
and was poisoned

1743
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,820
so she wants to find out the truth

1744
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,140
Right
Her burden is too heavy

1745
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:21,820
It's her

1746
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,140
Okay.

1747
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,060
So what are our doubts now?

1748
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,420
How does the food delivery hatch open this door?

1749
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,020
The door in front should be locked.

1750
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,820
There must be a mechanism.

1751
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:34,820
A secret room.

1752
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,500
No, it's the color on top.

1753
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,660
It's here too.

1754
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,460
Is there a code?
Yes.

1755
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,060
The things that happened today.

1756
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,700
Like someone delivering things to you.

1757
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:44,900
It wasn't me.
Who did you send it to?

1758
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,620
I don't know either.

1759
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,700
My life is richer and more exciting because of you.

1760
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,820
Bai Hanzi.

1761
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,580
What is this?

1762
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,900
Ke An, look, did you send this?

1763
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,820
I don't remember this.
Ba Fentang said,

1764
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,940
If I don't work, will you support me?

1765
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,900
I can't leave here.

1766
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,540
I can't leave you either.

1767
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,540
Did I say that?

1768
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:04,620
Yes.

1769
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,660
No, I think he's playing games with us.

1770
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,300
To mess with

1771
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,540
It's possible—he wants to play a trick.

1772
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,620
Because he likes pranks.

1773
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,900
After messing with you, he'll even share it with you.

1774
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,020
Yeah, he might find it amusing.

1775
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,660
He just likes watching people act like that.

1776
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,180
He enjoys messing with others.

1777
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,340
Doesn't he also love watching livestreams?

1778
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,220
He's my sister's top supporter.

1779
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,660
What could it be, then?

1780
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,140
All of us sitting here right now,

1781
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,180
are probably being livestreamed.

1782
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,100
That's possible.

1783
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,820
You get pranked a bit
and people online will send tips.

1784
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,340
After they tip, you get money.

1785
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
The boss is just
a livestreamer.

1786
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,860
So actually, this is a livestreaming business.

1787
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,140
We're not here making candy or anything.

1788
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,180
Our factory is just pretending to operate.

1789
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,860
Someone is tipping right now, probably.

1790
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,060
Shall we give it a try?

1791
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,580
Okay, you two practice now.

1792
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,740
Let's see if the money goes up.

1793
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,740
Let's start.

1794
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,940
But that's my money.

1795
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,260
Then you practice with him.

1796
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,860
Then I'll do the hitting.

1797
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,900
Let me do the hitting.

1798
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,060
You have to get hit.

1799
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,300
I get hit.

1800
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,940
Right, that's how you make money.

1801
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,580
Only when I get pranked do I make money.

1802
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:46,580
Wait a second.

1803
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,420
I think what torments me the most is

1804
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:50,860
definitely

1805
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,020
He, right in front of me,

1806
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,300
dancing that routine again.

1807
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,140
This is really tormenting me.

1808
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:01,980
You try it.
Really.

1809
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,060
Hurry up.

1810
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,860
Looking at this score, it should go up a lot.

1811
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:11,940
I feel terrible.

1812
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,140
Now there's even facial expression management.

1813
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,380
How about it?

1814
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,340
Dear audience,

1815
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,180
It increased by a hundred.

1816
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,580
Keep dancing.

1817
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,020
Dance with your clothes off.

1818
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,900
No, we've already confirmed this thing.

1819
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,820
So it should be...

1820
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,620
We're being livestreamed.

1821
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,980
We're the ones getting tipped.

1822
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,660
Next, we will enter the X confirmation phase.

1823
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,380
There is already an X.

1824
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,780
So fast?

1825
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,420
Next, we will enter the X confirmation phase.

1826
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:16,860
In this season's show,

1827
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,900
the X gameplay has been updated.

1828
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,260
Players who are the murderer

1829
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,220
will all face the X challenge.

1830
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,020
If the murderer passes the challenge,

1831
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,260
and succeeds,

1832
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,500
then they can choose

1833
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,940
whether to turn a detective to the dark side

1834
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,100
to become X.

1835
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,180
The darkened X

1836
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,100
will, in the following investigation,

1837
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,340
try their best to help the murderer escape.

1838
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,740
And after X confirms the murderer,

1839
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,100
there is only one chance to communicate.

1840
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,660
If the real murderer's votes

1841
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,220
are fewer than the other suspects,

1842
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,900
then the real murderer and X get the golden key.

1843
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,620
Otherwise, the other players who voted correctly

1844
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,500
get the golden key.

1845
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,380
You can choose not to decide now.

1846
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,580
If you are X,

1847
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,980
Who do you hope the murderer is?

1848
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,500
That is, who do you want as your partner?

1849
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,860
Of course, I hope it is...

1850
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:04,900
Okay.
Got it.

1851
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,500
Alright.

1852
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,180
I'll tell you who the killer is.

1853
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,820
I am an honest detective.

1854
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,380
Turning evil won't work on me.
Even if I turn evil,

1855
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,340
I will still fight for my

1856
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:14,980
sense of justice

1857
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,260
because of my sense of justice

1858
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,340
and battle for justice.

1859
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:22,620
Go.

1860
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:24,460
Let's go.

1861
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,260
I'm so nervous.

1862
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,380
No way.

1863
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,900
No, why is Bai Hanzi so fast?

1864
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,220
Because he isn't X.

1865
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,860
I feel like he's more like X.

1866
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,620
Didn't you just say

1867
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,780
you wanted to be a righteous person?

1868
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:53,980
That's right, it's me.

1869
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,300
I think he's X.

1870
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,860
I think everyone will tell the truth.

1871
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,260
Why do you

1872
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,180
have to talk about me with him?

1873
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,740
Hasn't he become more talkative?

1874
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,140
He has become more talkative.

1875
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,300
Then let's

1876
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,660
let's go there now

1877
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,260
to our boss Tan Qian's office

1878
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,060
Okay
Office

1879
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,340
Let's go.
Open this door.

1880
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,700
Let's go in and take a look.

1881
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,100
Let's not be afraid this time, okay?

1882
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:36,620
Okay.

1883
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,780
So what's the password?

1884
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,820
The password?
Wait, let me think.

1885
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,260
Zero one zero one eight eight.

1886
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,100
Okay.

1887
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,660
I'm speechless with you right now.

1888
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,980
Why are you holding a knife?

1889
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,940
Of course I'm being cautious around you. What else would I do?

1890
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,140
Alright, seeing this makes me a bit scared again.

1891
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,980
Don't be afraid.

1892
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,780
Get rich, get rich, get rich, get rich.

1893
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,580
We’re going to get rich.

1894
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,420
There’s definitely something here.

1895
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:12,980
The light flickered.

1896
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,340
Wait, why is this light actually flickering?

1897
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,260
What are you doing?

1898
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,940
Why isn't this light completely off?

1899
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:30,500
So annoying.

1900
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,900
You're interfering with our investigation.

1901
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,260
Okay, yes.

1902
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,180
Open these boxes.
See if there's anything inside.

1903
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,060
Alright.

1904
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,340
Did you check the file bag carefully?

1905
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:40,940
I'm checking.

1906
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,340
There's nothing in the file bag.

1907
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,340
Could it be in the file box?
No way.

1908
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:50,860
Here's one

1909
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,540
Five million regular candies

1910
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,420
Eight million eight hundred thousand hidden edition

1911
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,540
One thousand one hundred limited edition candies

1912
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,180
Five hundred thousand

1913
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,980
Two hundred thousand Helimo Jinyu candies

1914
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,260
That's our candy

1915
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,900
They just packaged fake candy and sold it for two hundred thousand

1916
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,340
What does that mean?

1917
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,580
Our candy sells for the cheapest

1918
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,940
There's a password here

1919
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,460
Swipe the card
It should be a password

1920
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,580
Try 01088 again

1921
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,260
What's "8181"?

1922
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,700
8181

1923
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,380
How about 8888?

1924
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,820
Prosper, prosper.

1925
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,100
One eight one eight.

1926
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,660
Can you confirm how many digits in total?

1927
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,500
Let me check.
Wait, like this.

1928
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1929
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,180
Eight digits.
Nine.

1930
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,140
Eight digits.

1931
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:42,580
It's an eight-digit password.

1932
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,140
Where else are there numbers?

1933
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,380
Just this, this table.

1934
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,140
Write it down, add them together, I think.

1935
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,420
Here.
Add them up.

1936
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,300
Two hundred thousand is

1937
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,100
Four zeros.

1938
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,660
Right?
This is, yes.

1939
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,460
Two hundred thousand.
Then

1940
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,100
Five million.

1941
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,460
Five million, five hundred, four zeros.

1942
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,580
Four zeros.

1943
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,860
Add five hundred.

1944
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,300
Why can't I enter it?
Press it again.

1945
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:10,900
Or just do the math in your head.

1946
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,540
What are you showing off for?

1947
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,540
Why are you acting so cocky?

1948
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,060
Over there.

1949
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,260
Can't you just do the math in your head?

1950
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,180
Can't you just do the math in your head?

1951
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:25,660
That's how he is.

1952
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,740
That's how he is.

1953
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,940
Can't you just do the math in your head?

1954
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,980
What are you guys doing over there?

1955
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:35,500
One thousand one hundred fifty
Twenty

1956
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:36,700
Eight hundred eighty

1957
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,580
Add five hundred, add fifty

1958
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,380
Two thousand five hundred fifty

1959
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,420
Two thousand five hundred fifty

1960
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,020
Or do it mentally

1961
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,980
Two thousand five hundred fifty

1962
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,700
Four zeros

1963
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,900
There's more to it than meets the eye.

1964
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,340
You're amazing.

1965
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:10,940
Qualified to show off
This is all I know

1966
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,380
Forty thousand credited backstage

1967
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,260
Twenty thousand credited backstage

1968
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,300
So much money.

1969
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,300
This much money.

1970
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,580
We’ve struck it rich.

1971
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,580
Twenty thousand credited backstage.

1972
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,020
Eighty thousand credited backstage.

1973
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,940
Ten thousand credited backstage.

1974
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,420
Sixty thousand credited backstage.

1975
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,300
Thirty thousand credited backstage.

1976
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,700
Seventy thousand credited backstage.

1977
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,860
Fifty thousand.

1978
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,020
What is this?

1979
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,140
What does this mean?

1980
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:14,820
What’s this?
What is this thing?

1981
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,460
Look, this is hot pot. See?

1982
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:20,860
What’s that?

1983
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,940
Your conveyor belt.

1984
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:25,820
It turned into a hot pot.

1985
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:27,460
Yeah.

1986
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,740
So there's a hot pot underneath.

1987
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,060
I was wondering why there was a smell.

1988
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:31,900
No.

1989
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,740
Has it been pranking you the whole time?

1990
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,060
Is that right?
Yeah.

1991
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:35,780
Look, for example, at this hallway.

1992
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,380
Where is this?
You don't even know?

1993
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,060
This is our dormitory hallway.

1994
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:39,980
Hallway.

1995
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,060
The dormitory is a dungeon.

1996
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,060
After adding special effects.

1997
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,700
Right.

1998
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,180
So we thought we were in the dormitory.

1999
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,060
But to the audience, it looks like we're in this...

2000
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,820
...dungeon.

2001
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:50,860
Where is this?
This is the office.

2002
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:53,700
What did they turn it into?

2003
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,060
The special effects made it look like a beach.

2004
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:55,500
A beach?

2005
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,500
This is our entrance.

2006
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,300
It's you using a soldering iron by the beach.

2007
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,380
Yeah, I was welding.

2008
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,180
Then where's my cafeteria?

2009
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,300
It's here.

2010
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,380
This cafeteria?

2011
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,300
The kitchen.

2012
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,100
We were just eating in the kitchen.
The kitchen.

2013
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,100
Right.

2014
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,340
There's even hidden filming like this.

2015
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,260
A candid camera angle.

2016
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,580
Where is this?
This is the kitchen, right?

2017
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,620
This is my...

2018
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:17,820
...bedroom entrance.

2019
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,420
This hidden camera angle is really creepy.

2020
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,220
Where is this?

2021
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,540
Is this the living area?

2022
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,260
No, this is that...

2023
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,260
The lobby.

2024
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,420
The body should be right here.

2025
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,380
The body is in this spot.
This side.

2026
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,820
Yeah, over there.

2027
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,020
From 6:30 to 8:00 in the morning.

2028
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:35,820
System maintenance.

2029
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:38,540
So what we guessed...

2030
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,540
The live streaming thing is probably true.

2031
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,060
Yeah.
Right?
Tips?

2032
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:42,500
We really...

2033
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,700
Look, when we came in just now, it said...

2034
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,460
Something about earning over forty thousand.

2035
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:46,820
Exactly.
Someone tipped us.

2036
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,500
The money will accumulate here.

2037
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,060
Yeah.

2038
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,100
He used our livestream.

2039
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,580
He's already made this much money.

2040
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:52,980
Yeah.

2041
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,300
He's made a fortune.

2042
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,300
Twenty thousand credited to the backend.

2043
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,500
Fifty thousand credited to the backend.

2044
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,820
Ninety thousand credited to the backend.

2045
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,780
Money credited to the backend.

2046
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,820
Making a fortune.

2047
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,060
Let's confirm if it's real-time.

2048
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,060
Is this really the scene, okay?

2049
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,020
Okay.
Alright, let's do it this way.

2050
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,500
Take a walkie-talkie and turn it on.

2051
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,060
You girls stay here.

2052
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:19,540
Let's go.
Alright?
Okay.

2053
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,060
The three of us "girls" will stay here.

2054
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:22,460
Sure.

2055
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,420
You're a "girl" today too.

2056
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,300
Yes, sure, no problem.

2057
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,580
Alright, that's fine.

2058
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:33,820
Alright, you guys can go.

2059
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,260
Okay, it's done.

2060
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,700
I want to stay here and protect the two of them.

2061
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,060
What should we do when it gets dark soon?

2062
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,020
You tell us where to go first.

2063
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,460
It seems we've already arrived.

2064
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,660
You come in and stand here. Come in.

2065
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:50,740
Come on.

2066
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,340
Lie down. Lie over there.

2067
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,020
Lie down.

2068
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,020
Lie down.

2069
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:56,860
Will this bring in more money?

2070
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,060
Lie in the hotpot.

2071
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,380
Cook yourself in it.

2072
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,100
Cooked.

2073
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,300
Money received.

2074
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:06,980
Got it.

2075
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:08,100
Thirty thousand credited backstage.

2076
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,420
Thirty thousand

2077
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,860
You get it just by lying here

2078
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,420
Without doing anything

2079
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,460
What is this

2080
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,780
That's how it is, so

2081
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,180
Isn't this hidden camera recording?

2082
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:28,180
Ke'an, take a look.

2083
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:30,620
There's a surveillance camera with a hidden angle.

2084
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:34,820
It's about at the height of your hip.

2085
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,580
Right, he needs to move half a step to the right.
On the right side.

2086
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,140
At the six o'clock position.

2087
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:40,940
No, it's just—

2088
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,540
No, it's this box.

2089
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,180
This white box.

2090
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:45,780
Metal box.

2091
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,140
Let me do it.

2092
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:52,460
It's right by the conveyor belt.

2093
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,220
That white surveillance box, yes.

2094
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:55,500
Conveyor belt.

2095
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,500
That's the conveyor belt.

2096
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,260
Right.

2097
01:26:58,260 --> 01:26:59,340
It's filming in the opposite direction.

2098
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,300
It's recording the spot where I sit at work.

2099
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,340
That's the one.
Wait a moment.

2100
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,900
The electrician is here, everyone.

2101
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,460
Take it apart.

2102
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,020
Take a closer look.

2103
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,300
Four.
This could be

2104
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,540
the fourth camera.

2105
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,060
Yes.

2106
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,780
Are we supposed to collect all the cameras?

2107
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,260
Yes, we need to collect them all.

2108
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,380
Where else is there one?

2109
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,420
There's another one here.

2110
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,700
And another one here.

2111
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,420
I'll do it, I'll go look for it.

2112
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,660
So cool.

2113
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,140
This looks like one of those vintage cameras.

2114
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:35,740
Yeah.

2115
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,580
It looks great.

2116
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,220
Where's that little security camera?

2117
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:42,660
Where is it?

2118
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,780
It's right above your poster.

2119
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,420
Right at that "Taste of the City" poster.

2120
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,940
Here, here.

2121
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:49,980
Just take it out.

2122
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,500
There's one right across.

2123
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,540
Across from the entrance.

2124
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:57,780
Found it.

2125
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,180
There's one in the flowerpot.

2126
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,500
Yeah.
The white wire is in the right place.

2127
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:01,860
It's right across.

2128
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,500
Yeah.

2129
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:04,580
Got it.

2130
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:05,780
Where's the other one?

2131
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,420
Yeah, maybe it's in this box.

2132
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,260
It's in the box.

2133
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,820
You guys are blocking it with that box.

2134
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,020
Move that box away.

2135
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:15,460
Yes, got it.

2136
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,060
That's all.

2137
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,220
Everything's here.

2138
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,180
What about the one in the upper left corner of your security booth?

2139
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,740
It's definitely not a hidden recording.

2140
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:23,780
This was clearly filmed openly.

2141
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,060
But I never suspected it.

2142
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,580
Let me take a look at that camera.

2143
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,940
Is there anything on it?
There's a serial number.

2144
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,420
Two

2145
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,700
We still can't get into the sterile workshop right now.

2146
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,740
There's a password.

2147
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,060
Six

2148
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,300
I got it.

2149
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,540
There are colors on it.

2150
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,940
You can open the conveyor belt door.

2151
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,300
There's another one, it's a...
Secret room.

2152
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:58,940
There's a hidden passage.

2153
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,100
We still can't get into the sterile workshop right now.

2154
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:01,900
Still can't get in.
There's a password.

2155
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,300
It's colors.

2156
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:05,220
Six colors.

2157
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,300
Let's go.

2158
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,540
Go.

2159
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:08,940
Go in.

2160
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,540
Not wearing the clothes anymore.

2161
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,100
It was really cold over there.

2162
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,700
This passage is really a bit cold.

2163
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,580
Did you help Ba Fentang hold the clothes?

2164
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:19,980
Got them.

2165
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,940
Such a great person.

2166
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:23,700
Don't say that.

2167
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,780
Why are you so nice?

2168
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:27,500
Be careful not to get sprayed.

2169
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,740
I didn't get sprayed by this.

2170
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:34,940
But I tripped over this thing.

2171
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:39,380
Press white six.

2172
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:40,780
Six

2173
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,620
Three

2174
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,540
Six, three, five, two

2175
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,300
Four, one

2176
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,540
What is this?

2177
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,100
It's... it's like this.

2178
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,580
It's a conveyor belt.

2179
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:58,260
It really is a conveyor belt.

2180
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,860
This passage is so long.

2181
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,900
And it keeps rolling forward.

2182
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,340
A treadmill.

2183
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,900
But how do you run on it?

2184
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,660
Because it keeps moving backward.

2185
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:09,340
Come on.

2186
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,580
Pioneer

2187
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:14,500
Let's go

2188
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,020
Accelerated.

2189
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:24,380
Accelerated.

2190
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,380
Accelerated.

2191
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,500
Accelerated.

2192
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:31,780
Accelerated.

2193
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,660
We don't know what a sterile workshop is right now.

2194
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,940
How come none of you kept up?

2195
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,260
I feel like it will
get faster and faster.

2196
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,100
I don't think that's possible.
I'm thinking,

2197
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,580
this is way too fast.

2198
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,500
Let me do it.

2199
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,620
I'll go first, let me go first.

2200
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,020
Hold this.

2201
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,660
Don't bump your head, come on.

2202
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,300
Let's go.
Slow down.

2203
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:06,540
Three, two, one.

2204
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,460
This speed is a bit fast.

2205
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,180
It's not very friendly for us tall people.

2206
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:16,820
How come I

2207
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,260
look a bit awkward?

2208
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,780
Like a cow, kind of.

2209
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,220
How come I

2210
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,060
am walking forward?

2211
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,300
Forward.

2212
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,740
A bit awkward.
The speed is a bit too fast.

2213
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,940
Not very friendly to us tall people.

2214
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:49,860
Don't climb, you can't get over.

2215
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:50,420
Don't climb.
You have to walk while squatting.

2216
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:51,780
Walk while squatting.

2217
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:54,660
Ning Dengpao, you're not moving at all.

2218
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,260
What? What is it?

2219
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,740
You're not moving.

2220
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:58,780
No way.

2221
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,420
You have to walk while squatting.

2222
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,620
I...

2223
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,700
It's easier if you walk while squatting.

2224
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,180
Hold my clothes.

2225
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:11,900
Thanks.

2226
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,340
I'll wear it.

2227
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:15,460
You go up first, I'll be the last one.

2228
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,340
This is so embarrassing.

2229
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,020
Go quickly, you go first.

2230
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,860
Not very friendly to us tall people.

2231
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,540
My hand really hurts from hitting something hard.

2232
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:43,940
Get up. Help him up.

2233
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,620
Get up.
Get up first.

2234
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:48,860
Get up.

2235
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,300
You go first. Go ahead.

2236
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,020
Step on this.

2237
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,380
Let me pull you.

2238
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,780
It's okay, you can do it.

2239
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,700
You can do it, come on.

2240
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:04,700
Alright, be careful.

2241
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:06,220
There's no other way.

2242
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,260
How do we help her with this?

2243
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:08,220
She can do it.
She'll be fine.

2244
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:09,980
Yes, walk over like that.

2245
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,220
So sore, I can't walk anymore.

2246
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:20,460
Just two more steps.

2247
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,100
Don't.
So sore.

2248
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,780
Just two more steps.

2249
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,260
I'm really exhausted.

2250
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,540
What is it?

2251
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,660
My gluteus maximus.

2252
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,220
Last two steps.

2253
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,500
Stand up.

2254
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,540
Hurry, hold her.

2255
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:41,820
Okay.

2256
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,300
Guys, we made it out alive.

2257
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,100
We can go outside now.

2258
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:45,460
So tired.

2259
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,620
I really feel like throwing up.

2260
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,340
I'm about to faint.

2261
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,020
If someone

2262
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,140
crawls in the forward direction

2263
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,300
it will trigger the factory alarm

2264
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,660
as long as you crawl forward

2265
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:00,700
everyone will know

2266
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,340
Okay

2267
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,020
That means it's one-way

2268
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:03,780
It can only be crawled this way
You can't crawl the other way

2269
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:04,820
No
That's the first rule

2270
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:06,340
The second rule

2271
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,020
If someone crawls in the opposite direction

2272
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,340
like we just did

2273
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:11,660
it will mess up the conveyor belt speed

2274
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:12,900
You can't crawl, but you can walk

2275
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,140
You lie on top of it

2276
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:15,660
Right
and get sent out

2277
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,860
It doesn't crawl, it transports

2278
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,540
That's allowed

2279
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,780
So the point you just made is

2280
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,540
Crawling will do this

2281
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,780
If you don't crawl, there's no sound

2282
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,300
So you can send a body

2283
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:24,940
Right

2284
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,540
Food pickup window

2285
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,020
Is it right here? The food pickup window

2286
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,340
There's a secret passage.

2287
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,740
This is the food delivery hatch.

2288
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,860
We have a sterile operating room.

2289
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,340
That's a place we can't access.

2290
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:40,900
So their meals

2291
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,180
I just put them in here.

2292
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:42,900
Is it open?

2293
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,300
It can't be opened.

2294
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,300
I think this is a route used for committing the crime.

2295
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:55,700
Yes.
It's a crime route.

2296
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:57,220
Of course.

2297
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,260
This door is—

2298
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:05,460
It leads outside.

2299
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:07,740
You can go out through here.

2300
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:12,740
There's a vehicle.

2301
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:15,980
This is the one—

2302
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,260
The candy you mentioned.

2303
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,780
This is the one you saw transporting goods, right?

2304
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,580
Yes.

2305
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,580
There's a very suspicious person outside.

2306
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,620
He's not one of our factory workers.

2307
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,460
But he's

2308
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,700
transporting our goods.

2309
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,180
Actually, our factory is

2310
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:27,700
just pretending to operate.

2311
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,180
There's also a bulldozer.

2312
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,700
Can the door be opened?

2313
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,060
It's locked.

2314
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:48,100
There's nothing here.

2315
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,740
Let's go.

2316
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,020
We're leaving.

2317
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,060
Wait a moment.

2318
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,100
There's a cell.

2319
01:35:58,900 --> 01:35:59,780
You can get up there too.

2320
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:01,820
It's fingerprint-locked.
Yes, fingerprint.

2321
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:05,900
Back door staff management rules.

2322
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,260
Except for the boss, Tan Qian,

2323
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,860
no one is allowed to enter the second floor.

2324
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,620
All meals for the second-floor staff

2325
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,860
are taken out by Tan Qian at a fixed time

2326
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,820
personally at the delivery hatch

2327
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,900
and then delivered to the second floor.

2328
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,980
Bring over Boss Tan's body.

2329
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,100
Use his fingerprint to unlock it.

2330
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:23,420
Right.
Move it.

2331
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,260
Go this way.

2332
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,540
Come, bring it over while sitting.

2333
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:50,700
Where are you guys?

2334
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:55,700
This place looks great for photos.

2335
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,740
I really want to take some portraits of you.

2336
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:58,420
Where are you?

2337
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:00,540
Hurry up and come over.

2338
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:01,500
Where is everyone?

2339
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,180
Help me out.
Wait, don’t rush.

2340
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:04,980
We’re thinking.

2341
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,020
Don’t shout.

2342
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:06,700
What?

2343
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:07,940
Hold on.
We need to think.

2344
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:14,140
You're trying to destroy the evidence, right?

2345
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,420
I came from over there.

2346
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,460
To help you move the body.

2347
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,660
And destroy the evidence too.

2348
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:18,580
Where did you come from?

2349
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:19,780
From there, the kitchen.

2350
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,340
Alright, you little killer.

2351
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,620
There's definitely something wrong with you.

2352
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:23,620
Little killer.

2353
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,220
Why are you guys moving so slowly?

2354
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,540
Yeah, we're thinking.

2355
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,340
This process is a...

2356
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,500
Such a great process for thinking.

2357
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,540
Thinking about what happened.
Right? And also...

2358
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:32,340
Isn't it?

2359
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:33,500
You have to...

2360
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,540
Pretend you're the body.

2361
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,420
Experience the process.

2362
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,620
Only then will you know in the end...

2363
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:39,700
How exactly the killer...

2364
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:40,820
Smoothly committed this...

2365
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,060
Crime.

2366
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,740
Maybe the murder happened outside.

2367
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,220
Come on, let's move it, carry it.

2368
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,460
Come on, each person takes a leg.

2369
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:49,500
Let's go!

2370
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,820
This is really hard.
Hand.

2371
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,100
It's so dark.

2372
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,100
Is this a tunnel?

2373
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,140
This is a prison.

2374
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,260
That's your sister.

2375
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:20,820
This is so scary.
Didn't she already die?

2376
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:24,860
Then she isn't dead?

2377
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,060
I've got goosebumps.

2378
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,140
I'm watching each and every one of you.

2379
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:36,260
A scam.
They want to restrict our movements.

2380
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,260
Kill you to silence you.
Stop pretending.

2381
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,180
No need to explain any further.

2382
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,380
What's going on, someone died?

2383
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:42,660
That's right.
Someone actually died.

2384
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,060
That was so sudden.
What a pity.

2385
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,020
Otherwise, we could have seen the murder.

2386
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:49,660
What does this mean?
