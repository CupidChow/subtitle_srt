1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,605
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:02,130
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,130
This is "He Li Mo Goldfish's Whisper".

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,630
Time.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,455
Let's start by

6
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:15,330
welcoming all the friends joining us for today's podcast.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,630
I'm Xiao Qi, Ning Ge's PD.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,350
Should we keep our voices this low?

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,675
This sets a standard for us.

10
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:23,875
Our voices can't go above this level.

11
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:24,250
Bai Ge.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,050
Bai Ge, your turn.

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,825
I'm Bai Ge's PD.

14
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm the older sister.

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,200
Are you Bai Ge's lucky sister?

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm Ke Yu's PD.

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,500
Little Chicken.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,925
Hello, everyone.

19
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:36,950
I'm Zhang Linghe's PD.

20
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,700
I'm Monkey.

21
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm Ba Jie’s PD.

22
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm Dada.

23
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm Meng Qi, Jin Jie’s PD.

24
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,910
A lot of Jin Jie’s fans probably know the name Meng Qi.

25
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,610
Because it’s been mentioned in our show.

26
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,860
So, I want to ask if anyone, after recording Kai Tui,

27
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,685
like Jin Jie,

28
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:59,660
or Lin He, has experienced withdrawal symptoms?

29
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,345
If you mean withdrawal symptoms,

30
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:02,420
maybe a little.

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,695
It's just that there's no more Bai Ge's "awu awu".

32
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:05,633
Yeah, just a little.

33
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,545
I kind of miss it.

34
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,420
Yeah, the "awu awu".

35
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,670
But mainly, after recording, we just get back to work.

36
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,570
We put in some effort for Kai Tui's group variety show.

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,725
So

38
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,175
Is there anything else you can share about the group variety show?

39
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:22,725
We're still in the planning stage for now.

40
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:26,275
We've also looked at a lot of feedback and suggestions online.

41
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,450
Like "start traveling,"

42
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,950
"start team-building,"

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,125
or "start singing and dancing,"

44
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,000
We've taken all of those into consideration.

45
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,850
Our production team is very open to suggestions.

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,175
So let's look forward to it for now.

47
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,225
Everyone, please look forward to it as well.

48
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:38,800
We're launching "Kai Tui."

49
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,180
"Kai Tui 4" will bring us together with everyone again.

50
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,680
Some netizens keep saying we're masters of puns with "Kai Tui."

51
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,380
Just like the recently aired "Good House Family" series.

52
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,480
Each episode's pun-based name is really interesting.

53
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,080
So I wanted to ask, how did you come up with these names?

54
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,355
At first, we came up with a lot of names for Ming Ge for this season.

55
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:07,430
But personally, my favorite was "Good Morning."

56
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,630
I really hoped we could use it this season.

57
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,180
Until we had the "Old Mansion Family" script,

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,180
everyone thought "Good Morning" and "Good Draco" were both really fun names.

59
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,330
We wanted to keep them.

60
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,530
So we started matching them with four-character names.

61
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,070
And then

62
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,070
For the Good Family, everyone brainstormed new pun names for each guest.

63
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,295
So at the start of this season,

64
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:32,470
had you already come up with all the pun names for this season's Ning Ge?

65
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,820
We thought of a lot of fun pun names.

66
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Everyone did.

67
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,845
Each producer would come up with fun pun names for their own guests.

68
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:40,895
Whether we use them or not isn't certain.

69
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,195
But we definitely brainstorm them.

70
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,970
But everyone is running out of ideas.

71
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,765
We just come up with a pool of names.

72
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,090
Then decide which episode to use them in.

73
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,740
Right.

74
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,215
Mainly, a lot of names were already used in season two.

75
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,790
There was a family tree, remember?

76
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,215
That family tree already included a lot of names.

77
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:57,390
So it filled up a lot of spots.

78
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,390
And then,

79
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,540
Actually, we still want to know how everyone feels about these pun-based names.

80
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,735
How well are they accepted?

81
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:05,260
For example,

82
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,810
if it's a four-character name,

83
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,960
or some really long names,

84
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,010
people might not remember them.

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,285
So, you just mentioned acceptance.

86
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:14,210
How do the guests react to their own names?

87
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,785
Hmm.

88
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:15,960
When they look at the card,

89
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,085
since the first thing on the card is the name,

90
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,785
they find the name really funny.

91
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,360
Then they start laughing.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,850
When you see them laugh,

93
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,475
you feel really happy.

94
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:25,025
You just feel like

95
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,525
the name you came up with is pretty good.

96
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,150
Because they also think it's interesting.

97
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,350
Yeah.

98
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,350
So after episode 8 aired,

99
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,450
everyone thought the relationship lines were really complicated.

100
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,025
People said that the PDs must have gone crazy from work.

101
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,675
To come up with such chaotic and dramatic relationship lines.

102
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:42,350
So I wanted to ask,

103
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,465
was it like coming up with names back then?

104
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:47,690
Did we plan out a lot of different relationships in advance?

105
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,490
Yeah.

106
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,515
Just like this question,

107
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:52,165
how did you come up with such intertwined relationship lines at the time?

108
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,340
Were the PDs crazy?

109
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,440
Our answer is,

110
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,390
Yes, we were.

111
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:55,865
Crazy.

112
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:56,590
Totally crazy.

113
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,590
The more we created, the crazier we got.

114
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,090
The more we created, the more excited we became.

115
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,660
Yesterday, I even saw a comment online

116
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,660
saying that Bai Ge never called Ke Yu "dad."

117
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,510
Like, did he accept this or not?

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,535
The whole "acknowledging a father" thing.

119
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,885
Is it because he got the script for episode 7 later on

120
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:14,935
and found out he wasn't actually the son?

121
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,185
So that's why he didn't acknowledge it?

122
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,410
No, he was just being stubborn.

123
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,760
It's really just his last bit of stubbornness.

124
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,270
Stubborn.

125
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,870
Stubborn.

126
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
So when everyone sees these kinds of relationships,

127
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,620
are they okay with it?

128
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,945
Or do they sometimes complain about it afterwards?

129
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:28,320
Or are they actually happy about it?

130
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,870
They think it's really fun.

131
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,370
They find it interesting too.

132
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,820
Yeah.

133
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,820
They probably just think we're crazy.

134
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,320
Actually, everyone's relationships have gotten better this season.

135
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,740
And everyone is getting more and more invested in the filming.

136
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,665
So we have to mention

137
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,690
our teacher Bai Yu.

138
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,890
We'd also like to invite you to share with us

139
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,365
some stories about Bai Ge during the whole filming process.

140
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:59,040
First, let's start with a question from a fan.

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,540
So,

142
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,150
after three seasons,

143
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,850
do you think Bai Yu has become more mature or more childish?

144
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,950
I can't directly say he's become more childish or more mature.

145
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,250
Because I don't think it's a simple feeling.

146
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,950
Because in every season,

147
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,500
there are both mature and childish sides.

148
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,875
It's because we've reached the third season now.

149
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,600
And everyone

150
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,330
um,

151
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,430
has become more and more familiar with each other.

152
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,130
And we've also grown closer.

153
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,480
So I think it's because of this environment and atmosphere

154
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,230
that he feels more secure.

155
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,530
And more at ease.

156
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:32,905
So,

157
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:37,505
he's more willing to show his childlike side,

158
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,330
and his more childish side to everyone.

159
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,090
And

160
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,340
maybe that's why people feel that Bai Ge seems more childish in the third season.

161
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,840
But

162
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,340
actually, even though he sometimes looks very steady,

163
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,915
like a real grown man,

164
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:54,415
there's still a child living inside him.

165
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,065
Like a child who might be playful every day,

166
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,490
and has his own world.

167
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,540
And doesn't follow...

168
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,580
He just doesn't play by the rules.

169
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,880
That's exactly it.

170
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,830
So sometimes everyone thinks he's the one with the biggest contrast.

171
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,655
And sometimes he always breaks the norms.

172
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:13,130
And does some unexpected things.

173
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,905
Like during the last recording session,

174
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:17,905
Baige was really attached to a stick.

175
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,080
He was just obsessed with it.

176
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,490
Yeah.

177
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,140
Can you tell us the story of this stick?

178
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,265
Actually,

179
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:28,390
I think the behind-the-scenes footage also showed his love for the stick.

180
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,315
Ever since he saw this stick,

181
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:34,690
he kept playing with it in his hand.

182
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,265
Last season, it was the little axe that Bai bought.

183
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:40,790
And this season, it's that 150-centimeter stick.

184
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,210
So what happened to the stick later?

185
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,635
Did you send it to him?

186
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:47,610
No, we didn't.

187
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,860
In the end, it was left behind.

188
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,860
I saw some netizens saying we must give him the stick.

189
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,235
But actually, after the last recording,

190
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,610
he said

191
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,113
he wouldn't take it.

192
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:02,375
So we asked him why.

193
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,250
He said he wanted that feeling of loving something but not being able to have it.

194
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,675
At first, I was already prepared

195
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,675
and had told our props director

196
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,150
that we must give him this stick.

197
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,775
Because Baige's staff had said

198
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,825
that the stick he liked must be given to him.

199
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:21,475
We were considering whether to give him a new one.

200
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,150
But his staff said

201
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,670
he would definitely recognize this stick.

202
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,820
You just mentioned that, for example, if you send something to Bai,

203
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,745
like giving him something new,

204
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,995
he would notice it right away.

205
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,895
It's the same when he's solving cases.

206
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,870
He can easily spot clues.

207
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,370
And he's the one who connects them all together.

208
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,820
He's very observant.

209
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,570
He's the one who's aware of everyone's state in the room.

210
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,320
Don't be fooled if you see him just playing around on the side sometimes.

211
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,995
Or doing something else.

212
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,845
But when it matters,

213
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:58,170
he can still pick up on some important things.

214
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,945
So it seems like he's offline, right?

215
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:00,720
But actually, he's not.

216
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,860
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,960
Although sometimes,

218
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,710
everyone says he doesn't talk much.

219
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,760
It seems like he's just quietly on the side, not competing for anything.

220
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,910
But actually, when he does speak,

221
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,635
as long as he says something,

222
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,435
it's usually right on point.

223
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,210
And he understands the plot really quickly.

224
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,510
If there's a problem, he'll reflect on it himself.

225
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,710
Actually, this statement

226
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,210
doesn't mean he's always combining each game session

227
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,560
and the results

228
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,655
to summarize his own issues—he'll also ask everyone, "Why did you vote for me this time?"

229
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,080
Or, "What were you thinking?"

230
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,680
Then he'll improve his own gameplay.

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,280
Yeah.

232
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,430
So when we look at Baige, there are still a lot of things that make him seem like a big kid.

233
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,580
And when he saw the zombie theme,

234
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,530
why did he keep going "awoo awoo"?

235
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,230
Why did he choose to portray his character in that way?

236
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,875
I remember asking him this question on the rooftop that day.

237
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:56,200
Because I kept hearing his "awoo awoo awoo" through my earpiece.

238
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,500
I thought it was pretty funny.

239
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,850
So I was wondering,

240
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,000
hmm,

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,075
why did he suddenly start going "awoo"?

242
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,250
Then he told me,

243
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,950
he said,

244
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,775
"When you NPCs showed up, you were always around me going 'awoo awoo awoo.'"

245
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,100
And then he bit me, right?

246
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,805
So I said,

247
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,230
"Oh, so it was because you got infected by the 'awoo.'"

248
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,180
And then there's the lively cuteness of zombies.

249
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,705
And then there are some other times as well.

250
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,655
Actually, my brother is quite mischievous too.

251
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:21,405
How should I put it...

252
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,780
For example, at the start of this season's pilot episode,

253
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,930
when we were taking him to get ready for his appearance,

254
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,570
then

255
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,220
I saw my brother's publicity shoot.

256
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,945
When they were about to take his picture with the camera,

257
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,945
I didn't want to block his shot.

258
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:35,170
So

259
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,558
I moved to the side to get out of the way.

260
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:37,020
Then

261
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,545
After the publicity shoot was done,

262
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,395
they showed me the photos.

263
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:42,070
That's when I realized

264
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,970
that when I moved aside,

265
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,570
he also moved to the side with me.

266
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,800
He even stood behind me on purpose as a joke.

267
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,250
He was trying to stop the publicity staff from taking his picture.

268
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
So the photos that came out

269
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,825
only had half of him in them.

270
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,600
It was just my big face in the front.

271
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,900
And my hair was flying everywhere.

272
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,550
So at that moment I said,

273
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,150
"Why is my brother so mischievous?"

274
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,600
His staff looked a bit helpless,

275
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,150
but with affection, they said,

276
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
"That's just how he is."

277
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,780
It's actually pretty cute.

278
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,005
From what I've seen, and from what you said before,

279
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:13,455
he's actually quite rebellious.

280
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,380
He really likes to say the opposite of what he means.

281
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,980
Even in what we just talked about,

282
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,830
you can see some of that.

283
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,380
Yeah, I think so too.

284
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,340
There was this one time,

285
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,640
I remember when we played a game at the convenience store,

286
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,865
he had to pick something.

287
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,515
We recommended some food to him,

288
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:28,690
some local snacks.

289
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,515
But he said,

290
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:30,915
"No, I won't take your suggestions.

291
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:31,990
I want to pick the small folding stool."

292
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,590
Then the next day, when we were filming another game,

293
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,090
he said,

294
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,690
"I shouldn't have picked this small folding stool.

295
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,565
It's completely useless.

296
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:37,365
I only sat on it once.

297
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,590
There are stools everywhere anyway."

298
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,830
Let's talk about Baige's styling.

299
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,130
Many people have said that Baige's looks this season have a lot of clever details.

300
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,530
The sunflower seed brooch, for example, is completely unique.

301
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,930
That recent one, too.

302
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,980
And those scales as well.

303
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,690
The earrings in this one, too.

304
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,015
Colorful feathers, colorful feathers.

305
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:03,890
My Little Pony.

306
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,065
You can't talk about it without mentioning My Little Pony.

307
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:11,765
I think all of this is thanks to Baige's studio.

308
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,040
Including the stylist.

309
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,690
How can they make the looks stand out even more this season?

310
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,890
So this season, he brought a lot of

311
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,170
different and fresh styles.

312
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,320
for us.

313
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,770
Which one impressed you the most?

314
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,270
The one that impressed me the most...

315
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,595
Hmm.

316
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:26,670
Which one do you like best?

317
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,195
I like every single one.

318
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:32,320
I like them all—I'm even pouring water now.

319
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
Because each look really feels different.

320
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,395
When trying on the makeup,

321
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,420
he was quite happy too.

322
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,340
For example,

323
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,840
for the pirate episode,

324
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,215
we prepared a long wig for him.

325
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:48,390
It was like Captain Jack's wig.

326
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,340
Then we started the fitting.

327
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,090
He put on the wig himself.

328
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,140
Wrapped the scarf around his head.

329
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,740
He had a full beard at the time.

330
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,140
He looked like Captain Jack,

331
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,190
but also like a rocker.

332
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,935
It was about him.

333
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,810
He was in front of the mirror, shaking his head and moving around, you know?

334
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,360
He felt really rock and roll.

335
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,760
Yeah.

336
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,810
Later, since it might be too hot,

337
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,410
or maybe staying in it all day would feel stuffy,

338
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,635
he gave up on that look.

339
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:18,810
I hope we can see him take on this kind of challenge somewhere else or in the next episode.

340
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,535
And also,

341
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:22,560
besides the styling,

342
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,785
he actually has a lot of other little creative ideas for his character.

343
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,035
Like in the red carpet episode,

344
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,660
do you mean the signature he designed?

345
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,135
That signature was

346
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:34,710
I think he asked about it at the time.

347
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,485
Then I said, "You’re going to sign on camera soon."

348
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,410
I asked, "Do you want to practice that signature?"

349
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,635
He just said it at the start.

350
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,635
He just said it offhandedly.

351
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,360
No need.

352
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,960
Then later he thought about it.

353
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,385
Oh,

354
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:45,360
since he was just sitting there with nothing to do anyway,

355
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,110
he decided to practice a bit.

356
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,960
Then someone gave him a piece of paper.

357
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,660
He practiced for a whole page of A4 paper.

358
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,810
After that, he designed a cursive signature he was quite satisfied with.

359
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,210
He was pretty proud of it.

360
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,635
Yeah.

361
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,960
He added some little creative touches to his character.

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,250
Right.

363
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,675
So does he usually do that with costumes,

364
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,575
or with some lines as well?

365
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,375
Does he do that too?

366
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,900
As for designing lines,

367
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,800
he doesn't do anything in advance.

368
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,150
He does it in those specific situations, like they talk about in acting classes.

369
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,650
Yeah, when he feels inspired in the moment.

370
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,725
For example,

371
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:18,113
when he said "sir, great righteousness,"

372
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,625
while bowing to Director Dan,

373
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,800
and said "a sense of righteousness arises,"

374
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,050
it felt like he was about to sacrifice himself.

375
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,200
He was about to become a monster too.

376
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,410
Or when the music and ritual troupe said the house wasn't clean,

377
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,485
he automatically got into character.

378
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:33,510
Like, "What do you mean saying our house isn't clean in front of us?"

379
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,860
When it comes to costume designs that help him get into character,

380
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,810
he also gives his own suggestions.

381
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,210
For example,

382
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:40,935
Yeah.

383
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:41,835
The pirate episode.

384
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,685
He thought the collar was a turn-down collar.

385
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,360
He felt a stand-up collar would look better.

386
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,185
At that time, the pants were also too big.

387
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:50,510
Everyone wondered if they should make them smaller.

388
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,960
Then Bai Ge looked in the mirror.

389
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,235
He said, compared to making them smaller,

390
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,535
wouldn't tucking the pant legs into the boots look cooler?

391
00:13:58,535 --> 00:13:59,510
That's the vibe.

392
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,310
He gives a lot of his own suggestions.

393
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,835
And then,

394
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:02,810
we noticed that

395
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,810
this season, Bai Ge has formed a special bond with the drone.

396
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,498
Yeah.

397
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,560
It started from the pilot episode, I think.

398
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,085
We actually predicted

399
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,535
which prop would be the most fun for each person.

400
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:18,285
At the time, I had a feeling

401
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,485
that Bai Ge might end up with the drone.

402
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,410
He always has a different style from everyone else.

403
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,160
And he really did get the drone.

404
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,160
We were even preparing

405
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,535
that if any guest didn't know how to use it,

406
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,485
they could ask the cameraman for help.

407
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,660
We hadn't even told him yet.

408
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,285
But he just fiddled with it himself for a few minutes.

409
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:36,123
And then he figured it out.

410
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,285
He didn't use it much this episode.

411
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:43,660
But he's already skilled enough to use the drone to film cinematic shots for everyone.

412
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,080
At the time, I thought he really liked this drone.

413
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,880
So this time, on his birthday,

414
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,030
we specially gave him a sign-in card

415
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,355
and the same model of that drone.

416
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,630
He also loves eating sunflower seeds.

417
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,880
So we bought a lot at that time,

418
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,380
all kinds of flavors of sunflower seeds for him.

419
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,730
It probably covered his sunflower seeds for a whole year.

420
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,870
That kind of made up for him.

421
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,720
Later, he complained

422
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,745
that he didn't get to eat the sunflower seeds.

423
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:13,470
Yeah, he kept mumbling about it.

424
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,995
Saying things like the sunflower seeds were all gone.

425
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:16,995
So I guess we made it up to him.

426
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah.

427
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,020
Let's ask the last question.

428
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,270
Bai Ge actually recorded 10 episodes with us this season.

429
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,745
Did he ever share his feelings about each recording with you?

430
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,370
Or was there a recording that left the deepest impression on him?

431
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,870
He's actually not someone who takes the initiative to share his feelings.

432
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,345
If I had to pick something,

433
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:41,295
it would be pretty hard.

434
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:44,570
I think he's someone who lives more in the moment.

435
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,170
It's like

436
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,005
he said, the process is actually the most important.

437
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,530
Of course, there are some memorable moments.

438
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,880
He mentioned some before.

439
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,130
Like everyone happily eating together.

440
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,330
Just eating.

441
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,280
And chatting.

442
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,980
And the rumor pool.

443
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,180
And rappelling.

444
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,130
And turning into zombies and such—he said he liked those more.

445
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,700
Being together with everyone means we share both the good and the bad times.

446
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,450
Okay.

447
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,875
Let's thank our sister for sharing so many interesting stories about Bai Ge with us.

448
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,025
And then,

449
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,700
We'd like to ask Dada a question.

450
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
About our Ba Jie this season.

451
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,100
First, could you help us summarize

452
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,450
if there was anything about Ba Jie this season that left a deep impression on you?

453
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,325
Sure.

454
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,975
First of all, I think Ba Jie is a very dedicated person.

455
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:36,050
She usually arrives in Changsha very late.

456
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,400
But the next day, she still shows up in her best state for filming.

457
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,550
She does her makeup in the morning.

458
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,850
She treats every role and look

459
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,750
and even when reviewing the character cards with her in the morning,

460
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,525
she's always full of energy.

461
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:48,750
She listens carefully when you explain the character cards.

462
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,000
And then,

463
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,900
she seriously communicates her understanding and feelings with you.

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,475
Most of the time, after finishing work,

465
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,050
she still has to rush back to the film crew.

466
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
And then,

467
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,250
since filming in Dingnan isn't very convenient for transportation,

468
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,475
after wrapping up, she goes straight back to the crew.

469
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,425
So I really feel she's hardworking and dedicated.

470
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:03,800
And also,

471
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,050
secondly, in terms of styling,

472
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,450
Because I think

473
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
she really is a miracle.

474
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,060
When we're designing the script,

475
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,010
we think in advance about which looks will stand out.

476
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,960
And then,

477
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,210
she always exceeds expectations with these looks.

478
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,435
For this character's look,

479
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:24,360
you imagine in your mind how it might turn out.

480
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,660
But after the makeup is done,

481
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,815
and she changes into the costume,

482
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,515
she still surpasses your expectations.

483
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:33,065
I remember the pirate time, I was waiting for her at the hotel entrance.

484
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,015
She finished her makeup,

485
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,590
and after she changed into the outfit and came out,

486
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,090
she walked down the hallway looking so cool and confident.

487
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,865
At that moment,

488
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:42,390
I felt like a real, vivid pirate leader appeared before me.

489
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,915
Yeah.

490
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,540
And the flower fairy outfit,

491
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,990
she

492
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,985
changed into it,

493
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:47,560
and when she walked out of the room,

494
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,335
you couldn't help but marvel

495
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,210
at how she could bring out such a unique feeling.

496
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,860
You'd believe she really is a flower fairy in the human world.

497
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,210
Especially when she held the bow and scattered flowers for that shot,

498
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,660
you'd feel so grateful that she's part of this show.

499
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,260
And every time, she actually takes her styling very seriously.

500
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:02,825
Oh.

501
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:07,000
Everyone can see that in every episode, Ba Jie has a different little handbag.

502
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,850
She carefully selects and matches all of them herself.

503
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,500
And I also remember, at the end, at the Good House,

504
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,575
the red outfit she wore for the ceremony,

505
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,050
she was carrying a small black bag.

506
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,375
Right.

507
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,400
And her dress was really long.

508
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,950
And it was raining at the time.

509
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,450
So then,

510
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,575
the dress dragged on the ground and got wet.

511
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,700
At that time, to avoid delaying the filming schedule,

512
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,075
she didn't ask our interview staff to help her deal with it.

513
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,350
She just grabbed a pair of scissors herself.

514
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,375
And cut the dress short right away.

515
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,850
So I think she's also someone who doesn't sweat the small stuff.

516
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,450
You mentioned she has a lot of bags.

517
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,400
The netizens are also very curious.

518
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,600
They want to know what's inside her bags.

519
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,990
Her bags are filled with lots and lots of snacks.

520
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,440
Basically, it's all snacks.

521
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,365
Just like Teacher Jingjing said,

522
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,140
her bag is basically a snack

523
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,440
supply station.

524
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,990
Mm-hmm.

525
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,640
There are lots of candies inside.

526
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,440
For example, fruit candies and milk candies.

527
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,390
And also the chocolate candies she likes.

528
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,190
Yeah.

529
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,465
There's also beef jerky,

530
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:07,190
milk tablets,

531
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:07,670
and then

532
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,070
I remember once, when we were filming at the Pirate Mansion,

533
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,920
she shared some really sour candies with everyone.

534
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,020
That made a few of us PDs really curious.

535
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,345
We all got recommended to try it, right?

536
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:20,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you try it?

537
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,870
I did. She gave me one after she finished.

538
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,545
Is it sour?

539
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,595
It's pretty sour.

540
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,720
It really was quite sour, wasn't it? That day at the event, after he shared a piece of candy,

541
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,295
Ke Yu was so overwhelmed by the sourness that she couldn't even tell her story.

542
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,745
She's actually quite willing to try these novel snacks.

543
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,220
She also really loves spicy strips.

544
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,770
She loves eating snacks.

545
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,820
And after eating snacks,

546
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,370
including when she eats

547
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
the snacks provided as perks by our production team, she always feels very satisfied.

548
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,770
And when she eats spicy chicken noodles, she always goes "hiss, hah" from the heat.

549
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,070
It's so spicy she can barely handle it.

550
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,920
But every time, she eats happily.

551
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,020
In the behind-the-scenes clips, you can see her come out and say to you,

552
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,970
"I ate too much again today."

553
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,370
Yeah, that's right.

554
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,520
And I think she's very kind.

555
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,420
She always, even when it's dark,

556
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,400
is the first to rush to Jin Jing's side to protect her.

557
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,900
And during the rappelling, she would put herself in Jin Jing's shoes.

558
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,400
She would try to understand and comfort her.

559
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,075
And after the rappelling was over,

560
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,550
she gave Jin Jing a warm hug.

561
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,450
Only then did she leave to catch her flight.

562
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,150
Also,

563
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,725
I have something to share.

564
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:20,100
That is,

565
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,985
Jin Jing

566
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,835
After she successfully finished the rappelling,

567
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:26,860
Ba Jie even used one of her character cards on her.

568
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,610
She wanted Jin Jing to be someone everyone praises.

569
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,660
Everyone would compliment her.

570
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,560
"You're so brave,"

571
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,835
and also say,

572
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:35,960
"You're such a cute little sunshine."

573
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,760
It's this.

574
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,210
It makes me feel that the friendship between girls is very warm and beautiful.

575
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:41,720
Yeah.

576
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,020
And also, when we were surrounded by the zombie horde,

577
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,470
her younger brother was trapped at the elevator entrance, right?

578
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,895
She was really anxious and wanted to save her brother.

579
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,045
She hoped that the whole team could stay together.

580
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,070
Everyone would be safe and unharmed.

581
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,420
Yeah.

582
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,195
Also, she is very attentive

583
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,320
and never kills the mood.

584
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,020
For example, on set,

585
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,835
if a machine falls over,

586
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:00,785
it might float up.

587
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:02,935
When the cameraman steps back to film,

588
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:06,285
she will remind the cameraman to be careful.

589
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't trip and fall.

590
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,635
And then,

591
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:09,360
if Teacher Jin Jing's hand is left hanging in the air,

592
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,760
she will immediately hold it.

593
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,510
She's like an 8x scope,

594
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:12,860
Yeah.

595
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,235
always paying attention to what's happening around her.

596
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,610
She always cares about how others are feeling.

597
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,560
She is like a Dilraba who is always there for everyone.

598
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,920
And also,

599
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,245
I saw a quote online.

600
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:24,145
It was really well written.

601
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:28,520
It said, "I hope there will be a Dilraba by Dilraba's side too."

602
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,095
Another thing is that she's humorous and witty.

603
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,320
And she's very imaginative.

604
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,270
Because several of her recent roles have been orphans.

605
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,570
He said

606
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,420
Why is it always orphans?

607
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,270
He would start to wonder if this is connected to the larger world setting.

608
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:43,875
Yeah.

609
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,225
Like the explosive mist in the pilot episode,

610
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,725
and later, there were also explosions during filming.

611
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,400
Then he would start thinking about it.

612
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,600
What is the underlying story of this season?

613
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,350
And during the last shoot at the Snake Man's base,

614
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,350
She found a mask.

615
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,550
She immediately started imagining all sorts of things.

616
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,390
She thought the mask was for protection against toxic gas.

617
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,290
She thought the base would soon release harmful gas.

618
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,590
And everyone would have to use the mask for protection.

619
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,140
Then they'd realize there weren't enough masks.

620
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,990
So everyone would have to decide who would sacrifice themselves.

621
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,140
And give the chance to survive to the others.

622
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,040
But in reality, the mask was just

623
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,315
something the production team accidentally left behind while cleaning up.

624
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:23,490
But it sparked her wild imagination again.

625
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,440
Then I started thinking,

626
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,940
how come we

627
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,075
didn't think of this

628
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,050
when we were designing the content?

629
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,525
Is she always this imaginative when reasoning?

630
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:34,800
She really makes unique and unexpected connections.

631
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,850
Also, I think she's a really quirky and adorable girl.

632
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,925
As we filmed each episode,

633
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,925
I honestly found her more and more adorable.

634
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:44,600
Let me share some interesting things.

635
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,850
Some fun stories.

636
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,225
Yeah.

637
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:49,550
The first time we filmed, there were real snakes.

638
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,100
She was really interested in the snake.

639
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,125
She wasn't really scared at all.

640
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,825
She even said she wanted to have a pet snake.

641
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,300
She wasn't afraid of lizards either.

642
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,200
And the last time, she absolutely loved the little puppy.

643
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,750
She's truly a girl who loves small animals.

644
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,850
And also,

645
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,380
Yeah.

646
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,605
Back at the Snake Man's base,

647
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:08,755
everyone was touching up their makeup.

648
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,630
After he finished,

649
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,105
he realized everyone was already sitting on the mats.

650
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:15,580
Then he asked our lighting director to cooperate with him.

651
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,280
He suddenly turned off the lights.

652
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,505
Then he rushed in to scare everyone.

653
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:21,930
There are lots of interesting things like this that happen.

654
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,480
Yeah.

655
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,380
Another thing is understanding the story.

656
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,095
Understanding, yeah.

657
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:29,120
Because this season is really different from the last season of Brainstorm Hall.

658
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,495
Now it's free evidence searching.

659
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:34,195
Each of our storylines starts from the clues we find.

660
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,695
Back in Brainstorm Hall,

661
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,070
the clues were all numbered.

662
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,295
So everyone could tell their story in order by remembering the numbers.

663
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:44,220
But in this episode, you just talk about whatever you find, there's no order.

664
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,740
But

665
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,890
once the order of storytelling changes,

666
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,290
the pacing of the story becomes completely different.

667
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,815
He had never played this kind of format before.

668
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:55,740
So during the first card reading in season three,

669
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,665
I was actually really nervous for him.

670
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:00,540
But I didn't expect him to tell the story so vividly.

671
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,640
He also answered everyone's questions really well.

672
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,040
I was

673
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,050
really happy for him.

674
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,350
And since he wasn't the culprit in the last episode,

675
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,875
but this time he was the culprit right from the start.

676
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,300
I was actually really nervous.

677
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,950
Was Bajie nervous?

678
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,050
He thought it was really fun.

679
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,750
It was exciting.

680
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,800
He also wondered if the other players would think he was the culprit in the first round.

681
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,450
But he was still very composed.

682
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,260
He was actually nervous at the time.

683
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,110
But he didn't show it at all, which was impressive.

684
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,660
Yeah.

685
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,785
And later, during the recording,

686
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:35,360
everyone said it was obvious whether he was the culprit or not.

687
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,660
Then, when we went back to the lounge to review,

688
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,160
he would confidently tell me

689
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,660
that if he played the culprit again,

690
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,310
he would definitely think about how others would perceive him.

691
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,210
And then he would

692
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,480
change up his strategy.

693
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,030
Yeah.

694
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:52,080
Also, since our show has a lot of cinematic shots,

695
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,180
he really is a professional actor.

696
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,630
He can always quickly grasp what the director wants.

697
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,710
Like the shot at the candy factory where he breaks the glass and it cuts to black in a second,

698
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,260
or the pirate opening scene where he fires a gun,

699
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,485
and the little axe throw in episode four,

700
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:10,060
and the shot where he catches the axe.

701
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,785
He nailed almost all of them in one take.

702
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:13,410
And he always has

703
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,160
his own understanding of his character.

704
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,660
So his performances are always very natural and skillful.

705
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,410
He handles it with ease.

706
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:21,920
I think this season,

707
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,220
what impressed me most is that I got to know him much better.

708
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,145
I realized that when he plays games, he’s in a completely different state.

709
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,820
He’s just so happy and excited.

710
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,670
Yes, when he plays games, he’s like a totally different Dilraba.

711
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,445
Yeah.

712
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,170
And he gets really, really into it.

713
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,420
Because this season added some game segments,

714
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,420
I didn’t expect him to be so different when playing games.

715
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,820
Like during the live recording of the sniper game,

716
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,045
I almost laughed myself silly.

717
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,570
And also at the rumor pool segment,

718
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,020
I didn’t expect him to tell me that part was so cool.

719
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,870
It was so exciting.

720
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,270
He didn’t care at all

721
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,120
about whether the perfume would affect his look.

722
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,370
He just thought having fun was the most important thing.

723
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,270
And then at the Snake Man Base’s anti-theft system,

724
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,915
because

725
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:04,715
he didn’t want to be carried away by the others,

726
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:05,940
like literally carried off,

727
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,990
he started kicking like crazy.

728
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,315
I was afraid he’d spin himself into the air like a helicopter.

729
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:12,015
He just kept kicking wildly.

730
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:12,640
Kept kicking and kicking.

731
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,915
And he said he was only wearing those anti-slip socks.

732
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:19,015
Only the socks were non-slip.

733
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,740
So he just lay flat on the ground.

734
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,325
And then

735
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:23,425
after he lay down,

736
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:24,000
he felt

737
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,850
he looked like a frog.

738
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,650
And then

739
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,250
he naturally made a “ribbit” sound.

740
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,700
That was just so cute to me.

741
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,450
It’s totally different from his usual, almost god-like appearance.

742
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,900
It’s such a contrast.

743
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,550
And

744
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,700
when he plays games, you see a different side of him.

745
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,645
So we are Jin Jing's producers.

746
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:48,620
Jin Jie mentioned on the show that Mengqi is her sixth good friend on Kaitu.

747
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,445
So today, we’ve invited her sixth good friend on Kaitu.

748
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:56,820
to share some interesting stories about Jin Jie on our show.

749
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,420
Okay.

750
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,720
First of all, thank you, Jin Jie, for saying that.

751
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,285
Then

752
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:06,260
One thing that left a deep impression on me was when we were filming the fifth case.

753
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,635
Then

754
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:08,910
At that time, the weather in Changsha was really bad.

755
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,385
Jin Jie’s flight couldn’t take off on time.

756
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:15,860
She waited at the airport for more than three hours.

757
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,935
It was close to one or two in the morning

758
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,110
when she was informed that the flight was canceled.

759
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,965
So she had to rush back to the hotel late at night.

760
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:24,940
It was all to avoid delaying the show’s recording.

761
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,290
She only slept for three or four hours.

762
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,940
Early the next morning

763
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,040
she flew alone to Changsha.

764
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,615
And at that time, she went from the airport by herself

765
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:38,190
and hurried straight to our filming location.

766
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,090
Jin Jie also did this so as not to delay

767
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,210
the overall recording schedule.

768
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
While putting on makeup

769
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,610
she had me go over the script with her at the same time.

770
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,535
Jin Jie has an excellent memory.

771
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,685
Every time I go over the script with her, it’s very quick.

772
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:51,760
She carefully looks it over once

773
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,935
and can basically remember eighty to ninety percent of the plot.

774
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,560
Actually, in the First Love series

775
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,260
So that day, even though everyone saw Jin Jie being lively

776
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,660
and very animated and all that

777
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,510
she had actually stayed up for a long time that day.

778
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,285
All night.

779
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:07,085
She was actually very tired.

780
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:07,610
One more thing

781
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,010
Hmm

782
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,410
Jin Jie is a very empathetic person.

783
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,735
Being with her, it’s easy to feel emotionally fulfilled.

784
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,160
First of all

785
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,660
she’s especially good at complimenting people.

786
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,910
She often gets lost in admiration of Ba Jie’s beauty.

787
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,660
She just can’t help herself.

788
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,960
Whenever she sees Ba Jie

789
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,710
she can’t help but praise her looks.

790
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,750
She could always make everyone in our group laugh no matter where we were.

791
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Yes, that's right.

792
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,950
Another thing that left a deep impression on me was our last case.

793
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,150
Because we finished filming quite late that day.

794
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,625
When we were filming the "Night Walk" adaptation,

795
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,225
we had to wait for a long time.

796
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:41,425
And the actors playing the NPCs,

797
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:43,000
they were also tired and it was very hot.

798
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,450
At that time, Jin Jie also

799
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,650
would take the initiative to greet every NPC.

800
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,900
She would chat with them,

801
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,750
make some jokes,

802
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,450
and help create a lively atmosphere on set.

803
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,275
When we wrapped up filming,

804
00:28:54,275 --> 00:29:00,625
she gave each of us a carefully chosen small gift.

805
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,800
She also wrote a very long

806
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,050
handwritten letter to each person.

807
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,310
She wrote them all herself.

808
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,010
And delivered them to everyone's room.

809
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,210
I want to ask,

810
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,985
in episode nine, Jin Jie wore that white outfit

811
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:14,610
with the very elaborate headpiece.

812
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,535
A lot of people are actually quite curious.

813
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:20,610
Did Jin Jie and her team prepare this look themselves?

814
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,260
Or did we give some suggestions?

815
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,460
Did she incorporate any of her own ideas?

816
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,960
Yeah.

817
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,210
At the time, we just told Jin Jie that this episode's outfit would probably be in white tones.

818
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,460
And as for the overall styling,

819
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,910
her team created it themselves, based on an image Jin Jie hadn't tried before.

820
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,935
So they came up with this look on their own.

821
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:40,160
I think it really suits her.

822
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,860
Actually, Jin Jie tries a lot of different styles each time.

823
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,160
That's right.

824
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,570
Yeah.

825
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,120
Everyone says that Jin Jie always plays Lin Zhenqi.

826
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
So when she gets the script,

827
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,720
when you talk to her about the character,

828
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,570
does she, for example, act out the scenes or get into character herself?

829
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,495
She always brings a lot of surprises on set.

830
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,720
She always starts as Lin Zhenqi.

831
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,170
I think Jin Jie is especially good at improvising.

832
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,665
She brings her own understanding of the character into the role.

833
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:12,865
Sometimes she adds humor,

834
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,515
or sometimes she brings in touching emotions.

835
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:18,915
So I think she always portrays the character in a very vivid way.

836
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:20,540
I think Jin Jie is a great actress.

837
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,215
Yes, and for example, whether she's playing a civilian,

838
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,290
a murderer,

839
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,915
or a detective,

840
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:29,415
she feels that every role is a new challenge for her.

841
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:30,840
She can try playing any of them.

842
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,390
Yeah.

843
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,590
So, for example, when she plays the murderer,

844
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,990
or the detective,

845
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,615
or even a civilian,

846
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:39,965
does she show different states and performances?

847
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,290
Or does she prepare differently?

848
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,590
Or does she get nervous when playing the murderer?

849
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,790
Everyone should have noticed

850
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:50,740
that every time Jin Jie plays the detective, she becomes a very funny, white-collar type detective.

851
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,440
And it's called his stress test.

852
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,690
I really like it.

853
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,590
For each of our other artists, when he does the deduction,

854
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,240
doing a stress test is actually pretty funny.

855
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,440
Yeah.

856
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,290
I also remember he created a memorable and interesting moment.

857
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,165
He was the only one during the deduction

858
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,490
who played "Werewolf" live on set.

859
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,565
That scene where he had the "killer" open their eyes.

860
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,440
Yeah, it was quite interesting, and he

861
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,960
seems to be really invested in the reasoning process.

862
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,635
So after each recording, does he review his own performance with you?

863
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:25,235
Or go over the reasoning process?

864
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:31,460
Jin Jie actually has her own unique logic every time she deduces the culprit.

865
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,410
She likes to use a narrowing-down method.

866
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,860
to identify the culprit.

867
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,210
For example,

868
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,960
the culprit might meet condition A.

869
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,985
So this group of people meets condition A.

870
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:43,060
And another group meets condition B.

871
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,285
When someone meets both A and B conditions,

872
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:47,660
in her mind,

873
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,910
that's the culprit. She really has her own unique logic for deducing the culprit.

874
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,060
And every time he deduces the culprit here,

875
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,010
the person he trusts most is probably our Ning Ge.

876
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,405
There was one time when he deceived Ning Ge while playing as X.

877
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:07,605
In the end, he even tried to prove he was a good person

878
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:09,680
by getting Ning Ge to vote for the real culprit.

879
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,555
After battling it out with him,

880
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,655
when he returned to the lounge,

881
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,255
he felt completely exhausted and kept sighing,

882
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:19,080
saying that being the bad guy is really hard.

883
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,195
Jin Jie is actually a very considerate artist.

884
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:27,220
Every time I spend time with her, I feel really relaxed.

885
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,945
She also always manages to make you laugh.

886
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:33,520
Being with her is completely stress-free.

887
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,020
Yeah.

888
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,120
And I think this season, Jin Jie has

889
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,315
made two big breakthroughs in terms of courage.

890
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,490
The first was when she did our rappelling challenge.

891
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,215
She was really, really scared up there at the time.

892
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,115
Her hands were even shaking.

893
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:49,790
Because she was gripping the rope so tightly.

894
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,190
After coming down, it took her quite a while to recover.

895
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,390
But she said herself that after experiencing rappelling,

896
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,540
she felt like she wouldn't be afraid of anything anymore.

897
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,005
But then,

898
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:59,380
she faced our Chinese-style horror challenge.

899
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,555
Everyone probably saw it too.

900
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:04,280
I remember there was a screenshot online.

901
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah.

902
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,530
It showed her before and after the experience.

903
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,930
She was completely a mess.

904
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,480
It was like two totally different states.

905
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,555
Because Jin Jie is actually very timid.

906
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:14,755
I'm also very timid.

907
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:16,805
When I did the Chinese-style horror myself,

908
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:18,305
it was honestly really, really scary.

909
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,030
I think it was even scarier than rappelling.

910
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:20,925
Yeah.

911
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,375
So after this season,

912
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,050
Jin Jie has become a bit braver.

913
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,950
I think after those two challenges,

914
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,200
when it comes to rappelling,

915
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
I think she should be fine now.

916
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,600
As for the Chinese-style horror,

917
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,300
Yeah.

918
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,900
It should have gotten a little bigger, right?

919
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,125
Didn't we also go through that zombie incident in the middle?

920
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:40,550
Actually, there are quite a lot of horror elements this season.

921
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,190
I think after going through this season,

922
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,790
she should have become a bit braver.

923
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,490
I believe Jin Jie can do it.

924
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,290
I mean, sis,

925
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,540
after we completed two challenges,

926
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,390
there's nothing we can't overcome.

927
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,090
I remember Jin Jie and her team mentioned

928
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,790
that every time she comes to the set, she says,

929
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,265
"This time won't be too scary, right?"

930
00:33:58,265 --> 00:33:59,640
"This time won't be too scary, right?"

931
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,285
If it is scary,

932
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:01,485
I'll really get mad.

933
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,160
She always says things like that to the team.

934
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,585
But it seems like every time after filming, she's pretty happy.

935
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:10,060
And then she starts looking forward to the next shoot.

936
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,485
All the worries about being scared before filming

937
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,335
and the tough words she says out of fear

938
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:19,985
seem to just be her way of comforting herself.

939
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:20,860
Actually, she

940
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,110
always enjoys the whole process after filming.

941
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,835
And when we were shooting the poster before,

942
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:29,660
Jin Jie even said she gets withdrawal symptoms when she goes home.

943
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,660
She wonders why the next shoot hasn't come yet.

944
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,360
And things like that—between our first and second shoots,

945
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,910
I remember there was quite a long gap, almost a month.

946
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,760
And the first thing Jin Jie said when she came was how much she missed everyone.

947
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,020
And then,

948
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,370
she's always really looking forward to each shoot.

949
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,345
Because I notice that every time Sister Jin comes down during the break,

950
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:55,395
right before the voting,

951
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,945
she keeps guessing whether her deduction is correct.

952
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:03,470
She wonders if she got it right this time—she always seems very invested.

953
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,420
Throughout the whole analysis,

954
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,490
you can see her discussing things with her management team after coming down.

955
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,790
She even seems to retell the entire plot to her team in detail.

956
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,165
She lets everyone judge whether her reasoning has any flaws.

957
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:20,940
Anyway, I feel like she's really dedicated to the whole deduction process.

958
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,640
Sister Jin has a pretty high success rate at picking the culprit each time.

959
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:25,870
And then,

960
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,895
because a lot of viewers have also noticed

961
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:32,670
that in our zombie episode and the pirate mansion episode,

962
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,970
there was an NPC who is actually Sister Jin's friend.

963
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,970
When Sister Jin was doing the rappelling,

964
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,120
she was really scared.

965
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,445
And when she came down,

966
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:43,170
she said she was already very nervous and scared.

967
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,495
Then,

968
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:45,670
when she saw her friend as

969
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,860
When the NPC was down there,

970
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,910
he wanted to cry even more.

971
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,685
Then his emotions really surged.

972
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,335
He felt it was hard to control himself.

973
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:57,285
At that time, everyone also had to stay in character.

974
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,835
They couldn't do anything outside of their roles.

975
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:01,610
He also had

976
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,990
a lot of thoughts inside.

977
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,340
He said he had to overcome it.

978
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,165
Because his best friend was also watching him from below.

979
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,090
Then he came down.

980
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,715
In private,

981
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:10,115
his friend was Dan Guanchao.

982
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:11,790
He even went to the lounge.

983
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,990
He hugged him.

984
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,590
The two of them hugged each other.

985
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,515
They even cried.

986
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,040
Actually, that scene

987
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,740
made my eyes well up when I saw it.

988
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,040
Because I felt that while they were in character,

989
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,615
they couldn't say anything outside of their roles.

990
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,090
But

991
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,100
once they were out of character,

992
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,000
they still encouraged and comforted each other.

993
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,175
It was actually quite touching.

994
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:33,150
At that time, she rappelled down.

995
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,350
Everyone applauded for Jin Jie.

996
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,450
When Jin Jie came back, Ba Jie

997
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,100
was the first to go and comfort her.

998
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,585
But

999
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:48,010
Jin Jie had an interesting observation because Ba Jie had just removed her makeup.

1000
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,360
Jin Jie's first reaction was, "How are you still so beautiful without makeup?"

1001
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,810
So, this season,

1002
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,285
we feel that Xiao Jin has really

1003
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:01,385
made a huge breakthrough on our show.

1004
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,560
And I think that he and

1005
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,130
the other five players have become very close.

1006
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,580
He’s also become well-liked by everyone.

1007
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,230
Yeah.

1008
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,830
Next, let’s talk about Ning Ge.

1009
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,630
When we were organizing the scripts earlier, we received some material from the PD.

1010
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,630
And what Xiao Qi gave us was piecing together each subtitle.

1011
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,480
And then,

1012
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,560
the acrostic poem “Can’t Be Without You” is the same as the one from season two.

1013
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,010
I just continued from season two.

1014
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,810
Because in season two, I had the idea to hide something as well.

1015
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,710
It was hidden in the subtitles.

1016
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,285
Season two was “You’re Worth It.”

1017
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:40,835
And I feel that in season three, Ning Ge has leveled up.

1018
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:43,560
So I wanted to upgrade this as well.

1019
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,160
That’s why it became “Can’t Be Without You.”

1020
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,510
A lot of people say

1021
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:53,560
that Ning Ge has gone from being timid to being brave.

1022
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,810
He makes everyone feel very safe.

1023
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,485
So everyone is very curious

1024
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,710
about how Ning Ge became so brave.

1025
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,670
Yeah

1026
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,020
Actually, he mentioned this in the first episode.

1027
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,820
This is the third season for him.

1028
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,770
And when recommending the food factory,

1029
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,570
after the NPC appeared in the first round when the lights were off,

1030
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,170
he realized

1031
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,120
that he wasn't as scared as he was in the second season.

1032
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,308
He wasn't even as scared as in the first season.

1033
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:18,870
Then during the break,

1034
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,720
he excitedly told me

1035
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,035
that he realized he had become braver.

1036
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:23,910
Just now, when the lights were off,

1037
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,210
he was actually able to protect them.

1038
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,535
He protected two girls.

1039
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:28,510
He was really happy and proud.

1040
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,285
Then he said,

1041
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:30,060
"Guess why?"

1042
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,260
But then he said,

1043
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,460
"I won't tell you yet."

1044
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:32,985
"Wait a moment."

1045
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:33,710
"I'll tell them first."

1046
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,960
He wanted to tell the other guests first.

1047
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,860
So he waited until everyone gathered to start recording again.

1048
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,160
Then he happily shared his reason with everyone.

1049
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,460
He said it was because of playing VR.

1050
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,510
It was one of the rare times he felt like a child.

1051
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,835
He only realized this during the show.

1052
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:54,060
Oh

1053
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,210
"I've become braver."

1054
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,010
But actually, he isn't that fearless.

1055
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,660
Even the other guests can see it.

1056
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,650
It's him.

1057
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,750
He protects everyone as he walks.

1058
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
He's afraid of heights.

1059
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,300
And he's also afraid of the dark.

1060
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,050
But,

1061
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
especially after Jin Jie joined this season,

1062
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,425
he wanted to set an example for Jin Jie.

1063
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:10,725
Then,

1064
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,650
even during the rappelling,

1065
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,700
he was actually scared himself.

1066
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,850
He was scared inside.

1067
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Mm.

1068
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,675
But he said—I also asked him privately,

1069
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:19,425
I said, "Bro, it's so high,"

1070
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:20,350
"Are you scared?" He said,

1071
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:20,815
Mm.

1072
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:21,915
Of course I'm scared.

1073
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:23,965
But since Jin Jie, Jin Jing, is there,

1074
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,465
he said he can't admit he's scared.

1075
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:26,740
Because Jin Jing is already so scared.

1076
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,140
He said he wants to set an example for Jin Jing.

1077
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,990
And help her ease her worries.

1078
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,440
So he restrained himself from showing his fear.

1079
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,115
Mm.

1080
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,440
But everyone noticed it too.

1081
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,690
He is

1082
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,790
still scared.

1083
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,190
Yeah.

1084
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,940
And also during episode eight,

1085
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,200
when he accompanied Jin Jie on her solo mission,

1086
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,650
I think it was also because of the word "brother."

1087
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,125
Jin Jie kept calling out "brother, brother,"

1088
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,625
and he felt that

1089
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,375
he had to give his "sister" some courage.

1090
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,425
He had to set a good example for her.

1091
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:00,000
So he felt that this word could

1092
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,490
make him even braver.

1093
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,340
You just mentioned that Ning Ge rarely has moments when he acts like a child.

1094
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,065
Most of the time, he's always like a big brother.

1095
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:14,565
He unites and leads everyone.

1096
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:18,265
Ning Ge is someone who, as everyone calls him,

1097
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:18,890
I think that's very accurate.

1098
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,340
They call him the "team leader."

1099
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,690
Because every time he comes to record the show,

1100
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,040
he really is

1101
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,000
like someone with a director's mindset.

1102
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,800
He

1103
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,650
is very sharp at knowing when and how to cue things.

1104
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
He knows what kind of things people should say

1105
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,950
to make it funnier

1106
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,725
and create the variety show effect that everyone wants to see.

1107
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,600
He always cooperates very actively.

1108
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,300
He wants to make sure the clues we set up

1109
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,050
We

1110
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,080
the clues that each of us reveals,

1111
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,180
he wants to cue all of them.

1112
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,705
He wants to do everything as thoroughly and perfectly as possible.

1113
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:48,980
Because he thinks

1114
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,455
among the clues we prepare,

1115
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:51,480
maybe this one has a funny bit,

1116
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,130
or that one does.

1117
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,255
If this one isn't mentioned,

1118
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:54,030
or that one isn't mentioned,

1119
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,380
then the staff's efforts might go to waste.

1120
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,805
That's why he's always so proactive about cueing things.

1121
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:02,830
He actively cooperates with the clues designed by the director team every time.

1122
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:06,345
He just hopes to reveal all the setup points.

1123
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:07,970
He wants to ensure the best effect.

1124
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,620
Everyone always mentions,

1125
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,070
every time, those amazing moves that everyone loves,

1126
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,970
and the camera work matching the action,

1127
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,420
all of these reflect the leader's mindset.

1128
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,920
Yeah.

1129
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,470
Even during the last recording,

1130
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,790
they filmed some

1131
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,965
when the six artists gathered backstage,

1132
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:30,140
they would call their teams to shoot some short videos.

1133
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,215
At that moment,

1134
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:33,065
Ning would also excitedly say,

1135
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:33,215
Hey,

1136
00:41:33,215 --> 00:41:34,115
I have an idea.

1137
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,040
Have you seen that one,

1138
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,415
where the camera comes out from here?

1139
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,340
Just pull it out.

1140
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,740
I noticed that in the show, Ning

1141
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,975
when he's reasoning,

1142
00:41:42,975 --> 00:41:46,050
every time he's solving the trajectory,

1143
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,925
he gets really excited.

1144
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:47,400
He really enjoys it.

1145
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,550
He says,

1146
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:47,750
Oh,

1147
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,650
I got it!

1148
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,250
No wonder he's a fan of Conan.

1149
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,850
No wonder he's watched all of Conan.

1150
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,900
He has a very obvious preference in this show.

1151
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
He especially loves figuring out the tricks.

1152
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,550
Every time,

1153
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,735
no matter which episode,

1154
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:03,510
he'll rack his brain over the method.

1155
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,560
The moment he solves the trick,

1156
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:12,010
he's genuinely, deeply happy and excited from the inside out.

1157
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,560
That's something you rarely see.

1158
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,810
Like a child.

1159
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,190
Because he was really smiling happily at that time.

1160
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,015
Whenever we figured out the trick,

1161
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:23,490
during our break,

1162
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,340
when he saw me again,

1163
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,440
he would ask me,

1164
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,590
"We got it right, didn't we?"

1165
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,790
"Did we miss anything?"

1166
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,390
He would get really excited.

1167
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,590
It shows he truly loves solving mysteries and figuring out the tricks.

1168
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,290
Yeah.

1169
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,990
He always gets close to the truth of the trick very quickly.

1170
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,740
He's really fast at it.

1171
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,330
For example,

1172
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,230
in the fifth episode with the double culprit,

1173
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,730
the one where he and Ke were both culprits,

1174
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,280
even though he was the culprit that time,

1175
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,905
he didn't know what the trick was.

1176
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:48,530
But his reasoning was spot on that time.

1177
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,630
As soon as he came out,

1178
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,630
he was really excited.

1179
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,580
He felt like he was getting close to the truth.

1180
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,993
Every time I discussed character settings with him,

1181
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,530
Kaning is someone who takes his work very seriously.

1182
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,255
Details.

1183
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:58,280
And then,

1184
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,305
he makes sure to understand every single point.

1185
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:02,780
He really digests and absorbs everything.

1186
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,230
Every time, after I go over the character with him the day before,

1187
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,430
he asks to keep a copy of the character card.

1188
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,905
He reviews it himself at night.

1189
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:10,480
And then looks at it again before filming the next day.

1190
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,830
So he always digests the story really well.

1191
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,480
Yeah.

1192
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,430
Another thing is, when it comes to his own character,

1193
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,555
after he absorbs and digests it,

1194
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,580
he also does some creative work.

1195
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,580
For example,

1196
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,405
in the second episode about screwing in the lightbulb,

1197
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:25,930
he played the "white cut black" role, right?

1198
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,405
At first, no one knew who he was.

1199
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,430
But in reality, he was actually the mastermind behind everything.

1200
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,980
He was a troublemaker.

1201
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,380
Everyone called him a troublemaker.

1202
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,230
During the first episode,

1203
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,355
he didn't know his own backstory either.

1204
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:39,230
Then, when he found out that his character was actually someone who appears innocent but is actually cunning,

1205
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,135
he really immersed himself in that role.

1206
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:42,310
When he was looking at the character cards,

1207
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,285
he was absorbing the information

1208
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:46,860
and thinking about how to portray this character in front of everyone.

1209
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,410
So after he learned about the story,

1210
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,310
he quickly looked for a pair of glasses.

1211
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,360
Specifically, a pair of rimless black glasses.

1212
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,235
He put them on himself.

1213
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,010
After trying on a few pairs of glasses from the props,

1214
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,985
he felt that they all looked too refined.

1215
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:02,760
They didn't match the innocent look his character was supposed to have before revealing his true nature.

1216
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,460
So he picked a cute pair of glasses.

1217
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,160
Then,

1218
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,860
after quickly finding a cute pair,

1219
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,860
he put them on.

1220
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,110
Then,

1221
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,135
he kept wearing those glasses until his identity was revealed.

1222
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:13,660
He wore those glasses the whole time.

1223
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,410
Then,

1224
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,610
after his clues were discovered,

1225
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,160
he even deliberately chose a moment

1226
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,890
Then he thinks about what kind of speaking pace to use.

1227
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,515
Then, snap—

1228
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:21,990
I want to take off these glasses.

1229
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,640
As soon as I take them off,

1230
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,440
I instantly switch from innocent to cunning.

1231
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,590
I start changing my expression.

1232
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,290
Change my tone of voice.

1233
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,415
And talk to you in a different way.

1234
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,840
He thinks about all these things himself.

1235
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,240
And he enriches every character with these details.

1236
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,815
He always strives for perfection every time.

1237
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:35,915
Because the script has a lot of little details.

1238
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,590
After he goes through everything,

1239
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,540
and finishes telling his story,

1240
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,040
he comes out

1241
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,790
and asks me if he missed any points.

1242
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,040
Like, are there any points you set up earlier

1243
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,990
that I didn’t mention?

1244
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,465
Or, how did I do with today’s story?

1245
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:48,940
Was it complete or not?

1246
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,490
Did it have a good rhythm and all that?

1247
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,590
But every time, he does it really well.

1248
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,215
And every time, he tells the story

1249
00:44:54,215 --> 00:44:55,690
even better than I wrote it in the script.

1250
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,590
Because he’s much funnier than I am.

1251
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,000
He’s also very good at expressing himself.

1252
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,850
He comes up with some really great lines.

1253
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,400
Like that one with Ba,

1254
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,500
where I hold an umbrella for him.

1255
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,050
Every time, I can also help out a bit.

1256
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,225
Lines like that.

1257
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:12,150
They’re all his own improvisations, and many of them are really funny.

1258
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,715
Like you said, Ming-ge will come out and ask,

1259
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:18,865
Did I say it right just now, or did I mention the clues the staff set up?

1260
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:23,765
Did I share everything? Is he also a very sensitive person?

1261
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:29,040
He really is the best father figure in the He Li Mo Jin Yu team.

1262
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,140
He’s the best at deduction.

1263
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,190
He’s the best Ge in the universe.

1264
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,715
During the recording,

1265
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:37,990
he pays close attention to every detail.

1266
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,240
Actually,

1267
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,540
I already wrote this in the director's notes for season two.

1268
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,315
I mentioned it before.

1269
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:43,240
But in season three, it's even more pronounced.

1270
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
He has improved even further.

1271
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,740
He’s become even more attentive.

1272
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,265
There are so many incredibly detailed little things.

1273
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:51,090
He takes extra care of the two younger girls.

1274
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,015
For example, during the pirate episode recording,

1275
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,140
it was cold at that time.

1276
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,540
He gave his jacket to Jin Jing to keep her warm.

1277
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,730
The first time he tried to give it,

1278
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,955
Jin Jie actually refused once.

1279
00:45:58,955 --> 00:45:59,780
Jin Jie thought,

1280
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,743
you're cold too,

1281
00:46:00,743 --> 00:46:02,030
so you don't need to give it to me.

1282
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,480
Then my brother tried again.

1283
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,655
He said,

1284
00:46:03,655 --> 00:46:04,505
then give me a chance.

1285
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:05,230
I want to build my persona.

1286
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:05,880
There are cameras here.

1287
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,555
Let me build my persona.

1288
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,605
He helps you let go of your burdens,

1289
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:10,430
and makes you feel comfortable and cared for.

1290
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:10,830
And then,

1291
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:11,730
even in daily life,

1292
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,530
he always gives Dilraba a blanket,

1293
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,605
and when searching, he calls everyone to help the girls search.

1294
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:15,955
Things like that.

1295
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:17,880
Whenever any of the younger ones speak,

1296
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,480
he always responds.

1297
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,055
He tries to make sure no one's words are ignored.

1298
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:27,305
And then, on the day of rappelling, when Jin Jie was up there,

1299
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:29,180
because we were filming the rappelling very late,

1300
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,430
at that time,

1301
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,680
Ning Ge heard that Jin Jie was rappelling down.

1302
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,680
He heard Jin Jie was scared, and he got really anxious.

1303
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,580
He was just wearing a little vest underneath.

1304
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,730
He rushed outside.

1305
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,580
Ming Ge's assistant grabbed his denim jacket and chased after him.

1306
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:43,943
Saying,

1307
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:45,230
Put it on, put it on, put it on!

1308
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,930
He chased him all the way down.

1309
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,150
After coming downstairs,

1310
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,100
he finally caught up.

1311
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,775
You can tell from this detail

1312
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:52,300
that my brother is really considerate.

1313
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,150
But I want to add something here.

1314
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,500
At that time, Zhang was also eating.

1315
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,050
After telling him,

1316
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,050
he immediately put down his chopsticks and rushed out to meet Jin.

1317
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,890
Yes, the two of them went one after the other.

1318
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,540
And another thing, at the very beginning, let's talk about the reasoning.

1319
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,840
This show is very passionate.

1320
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,315
I don't know if everyone noticed,

1321
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:10,565
but after filming wrapped up, Ning

1322
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:14,390
quietly added a small ornament to his livestream background.

1323
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,690
Did you see that? Yes, that's from the wrap party on the last day of filming.

1324
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,210
There was a trophy, a little wobbling trophy.

1325
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,035
It was a trophy they awarded to each other.

1326
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:27,760
Then my brother took it home.

1327
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,160
And he put it in the background of his livestream, where it wobbles.

1328
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:30,710
Yeah.

1329
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,143
And another thing everyone knows is

1330
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:36,360
he wore the same shirt from the wrap day to watch "Folding Waist."

1331
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,560
Everyone called it a dream crossover.

1332
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,210
My brother really is a very thoughtful person.

1333
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,880
He’s thorough in every aspect.

1334
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,780
He takes good care of everyone.

1335
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,055
It feels like he’s always saying, “I’m fine.”

1336
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:48,630
I’m fine.

1337
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,080
It’s okay.

1338
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,030
That’s Ning-ge’s catchphrase.

1339
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,455
I personally think Ning-ge’s catchphrase is “It’s fine.”

1340
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:56,030
Because I hear him say it so often.

1341
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,030
Including when he’s with the Detective Team members.

1342
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,680
He also says it a lot to the younger members during filming.

1343
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,350
I’d say,

1344
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:02,850
It’s fine.

1345
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,500
It’s okay.

1346
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:03,850
It’s fine.

1347
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,475
We’re all here.

1348
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:04,925
It’s fine.

1349
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:05,925
What’s the big deal?

1350
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,200
It’s fine.

1351
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,125
This isn’t scary.

1352
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,525
What’s there to be afraid of with this lighting?

1353
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:09,200
It’s fine.

1354
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,575
It’s fine.

1355
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:10,550
We can still go save him.

1356
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,500
It’s really fine.

1357
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,500
That’s his catchphrase.

1358
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,825
So, in the show,

1359
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:19,225
Ning-ge often plays the elder role.

1360
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:21,800
Or sometimes acts as a senior figure.

1361
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:22,815
Right.

1362
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:25,765
But in episode eight,

1363
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:29,290
we actually made him play a younger role.

1364
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,115
Did he feel anything about that?

1365
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:34,515
Did he find it interesting,

1366
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:38,940
or did he feel like he needed to change his acting style?

1367
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,090
Would he think about things like that?

1368
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,040
Hmm.

1369
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,670
It's because in this episode, Ning had to take on a younger generation role.

1370
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:45,420
He didn't—

1371
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,595
He himself didn't know just by looking at the card.

1372
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:49,570
So all of his reactions happened live on the spot.

1373
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,970
When he looked at the card,

1374
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,820
he thought,

1375
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,045
"Oh,

1376
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:57,495
so on the surface, I have the identity of a 60-year-old 'good morning',

1377
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:59,670
but in reality, I'm a 24-year-old 'morning'."

1378
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,655
So he just thought,

1379
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:04,255
"I just need to maintain this age."

1380
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,555
Then,

1381
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:09,055
he never considered that he might have a dad on the spot.

1382
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:11,780
Because no one had ever played his dad before.

1383
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,230
He never had that awareness.

1384
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,805
Then,

1385
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:17,180
until at the scene, when Ke Yu's stuff was searched and revealed,

1386
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,355
to make sure he could react immediately,

1387
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:20,330
that Ke Yu was his dad,

1388
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:20,800
then,

1389
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,250
before I went in,

1390
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,750
I showed him the photo from Ke Yu's plastic surgery record,

1391
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,400
the one cropped out showing his dad's original face.

1392
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:29,900
At that time,

1393
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,075
Ming might have looked at this photo

1394
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:31,425
and thought,

1395
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:33,250
"Are we maybe going to have an NPC?"

1396
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:33,650
But

1397
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,400
he never expected to see Ke Yu and realize, "That's my dad!"

1398
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,300
Then,

1399
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,175
so his reaction at the time was spot on,

1400
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:41,000
very surprised.

1401
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:41,625
Yeah.

1402
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,725
He thought it was really fun.

1403
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:46,450
We can't always make Ming play the dad, right?

1404
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,400
We have to give everyone some new character relationships.

1405
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,450
Everyone will feel the same way.

1406
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,100
It excites everyone and makes it fun.

1407
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,350
So he

1408
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,200
can't really say he enjoys it yet.

1409
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,150
But at least he's happy.

1410
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,250
Because he himself has said

1411
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,275
that when he's in character,

1412
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:03,800
he follows the character's way of speaking and acting.

1413
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,530
And when he's in character,

1414
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,255
he's happy when others call him "dad."

1415
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,505
He's also happy to call others "dad."

1416
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:11,530
But once he's out of character, he can't take advantage of others.

1417
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,005
Alright.

1418
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:18,130
So we've finished talking about all these interesting things about Ning Ge's best songs.

1419
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,880
Now let's talk about

1420
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,980
our Zhang Linghe.

1421
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,260
I see a lot of people are asking about Zhang.

1422
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,610
They wonder what changes there are between this season and the last for him.

1423
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,185
Actually,

1424
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:30,560
what stands out to me most is that he seems more confident this season.

1425
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,460
He’s also more willing to stick to his own opinions.

1426
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,935
And in terms of reasoning,

1427
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:37,110
he’s become better at figuring things out.

1428
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:40,810
These are things he’s probably learned from a whole season of the show.

1429
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,145
Yeah.

1430
00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:42,870
For example, last season,

1431
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,220
sometimes he’d come up with a really creative idea,

1432
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,995
but if others disagreed,

1433
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:47,670
after they objected,

1434
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,220
he would immediately give up on his own view.

1435
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,370
But this season, he’s more persistent.

1436
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,020
Every time after the reasoning session,

1437
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,120
he goes back to the lounge and decisively writes down who he thinks the culprit is on his ballot.

1438
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,895
And then,

1439
00:50:57,895 --> 00:51:00,370
except for the episode where he struggled with voting for Baige,

1440
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,800
because in his heart, he thought Keyu fit all the characteristics of the culprit better.

1441
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,575
But,

1442
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:10,150
for the sake of his pride as a man, he made the tough decision to choose Baige.

1443
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,700
He’s also gotten a better grasp of how to deduce the culprit.

1444
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,100
And,

1445
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,000
nowadays, Zhang

1446
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,775
always, before group discussions or voting,

1447
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,400
he’ll go through today’s suspects

1448
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,180
and see if each one meets the conditions required for today’s crime.

1449
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,855
By using these criteria,

1450
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:28,430
he can accurately eliminate those who couldn’t have committed the crime.

1451
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,205
He also ranks the likelihood of the others being the culprit.

1452
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:33,355
Like, who would have a harder time,

1453
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:34,780
and who would have it easier.

1454
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,580
At the same time,

1455
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,455
he also thinks about

1456
00:51:36,455 --> 00:51:38,955
how to convince everyone that he’s not the culprit.

1457
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:41,255
And how to defend himself if everyone suspects him.

1458
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:43,430
These are things he’s always considering.

1459
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:47,170
I believe everyone can see Zhang Ge's performance in this aspect on the show.

1460
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,270
And then,

1461
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,445
Also, in the previous season,

1462
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:53,520
Zhang Ge was very quick to understand his own storyline.

1463
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,720
He could grasp his own plot.

1464
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,895
But this season,

1465
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,345
as soon as he got his character card,

1466
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:59,345
he started thinking about other people's storylines.

1467
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:03,220
Because our character cards list other people's names, professions, and ages.

1468
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,670
So he began to guess the plot.

1469
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:05,300
For example,

1470
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,000
in the "Tui Bai Yi" episode,

1471
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,800
as soon as he got the card,

1472
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,125
he saw that Ning Que Wu Lan was Ba Mian Ling Long's assistant.

1473
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:09,800
He told me,

1474
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,100
Ning Que Wu Lan must like his own artist,

1475
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,200
so he wants to kill Tui Bai Yi, who bullied his artist.

1476
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,700
He also said that when he saw "Ke Ban Chu Shen",

1477
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,200
he said,

1478
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,975
Ke Ban Chu Shen must also like Ba Mian Ling Long,

1479
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:21,150
and also killed for him.

1480
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,200
He would make his own guesses like this.

1481
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,650
Also, this season,

1482
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,480
everyone can see that he's becoming more and more relaxed.

1483
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,430
He envies Bai Ge's sense of ease the most.

1484
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,780
Actually, that's something he really wants to achieve too.

1485
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,530
But as he got more familiar with everyone this season,

1486
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,680
Zhang Ge became more willing to present himself this way to everyone.

1487
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,780
Especially during the last two recordings,

1488
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,130
after he finished filming "Zhu Yu",

1489
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,380
he became even more relaxed.

1490
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,230
Those two times, he was completely at ease.

1491
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,130
He totally let himself go.

1492
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,805
And he became even more adorable.

1493
00:52:49,805 --> 00:52:50,130
Mm-hmm.

1494
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,855
Because you just mentioned what makes him so cute.

1495
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:58,130
In the behind-the-scenes footage, we also saw him acting really cute in front of that drawing.

1496
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,280
Then the next second, someone said, "Hold your breath for a bit."

1497
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,180
He immediately started holding his breath.

1498
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:05,630
Are there any other cute moments that didn't make it into the show that you can share?

1499
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
For example, during the second episode,

1500
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,330
that was the battle royale episode.

1501
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,705
After Ke Yu left,

1502
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:11,455
we stopped filming for the day.

1503
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,055
We continued filming the next day.

1504
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:13,480
And then,

1505
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,655
as soon as Zhang came out, he said to me,

1506
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:16,255
"Why did you close the gate so quickly?"

1507
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,880
He almost made it back in.

1508
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,255
Then I told him,

1509
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:20,305
"That's just how the show is set up."

1510
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:22,180
"Our format requires eliminations."

1511
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,780
He asked, "Is he really eliminated?"

1512
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,805
"Is he not coming back?"

1513
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:25,430
I said, "Yeah."

1514
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,605
"He won't be here for filming tomorrow."

1515
00:53:26,605 --> 00:53:27,080
Then he asked me,

1516
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,530
"What if he was the culprit?"

1517
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:28,980
Then,

1518
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,505
I told him,

1519
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:30,205
"If he was the culprit,"

1520
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:31,105
"you guys would just keep investigating,"

1521
00:53:31,105 --> 00:53:32,255
"and eventually catch him."

1522
00:53:32,255 --> 00:53:35,280
That night, there was that part later shown in the program,

1523
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,105
where Ke Yu said in the group chat that he wouldn't be filming the next day.

1524
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:38,630
Zhang immediately spoke up for him.

1525
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,830
Because he completely believed me that Ke Yu was really eliminated.

1526
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:42,130
Later on,

1527
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,430
Zhang, Jin, and Ning entered the big spinning wheel.

1528
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,105
And then,

1529
00:53:46,105 --> 00:53:48,030
he was the first one eliminated from the spinning wheel.

1530
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,305
Then,

1531
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:49,830
after he came out, he just walked out.

1532
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:50,670
I said,

1533
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,070
what are you doing?

1534
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,745
He said,

1535
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:52,720
Wasn't I eliminated?

1536
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,120
I'm going back to the lounge to get my things and leave.

1537
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,820
After filming was over, I couldn't tell him that he wasn't actually eliminated.

1538
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,520
I could only tell him,

1539
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,270
just wait a bit longer.

1540
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,245
Let's wait here a little longer.

1541
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:02,445
So he stayed there.

1542
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:06,620
Then he peeked through the window, watching Jin Jie and Ning Ge continue playing the game inside.

1543
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:07,020
I said,

1544
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,783
don't stand here.

1545
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:08,620
You'll get caught on camera.

1546
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,035
But he just wouldn't leave.

1547
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:12,710
He kept peeking through that window.

1548
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:16,160
And another thing, in the clues for episode nine,

1549
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,810
didn't Zhang Ge sing "Two Butterflies"?

1550
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,585
The night before, I went to rehearse with him.

1551
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:22,485
I told him,

1552
00:54:22,485 --> 00:54:22,910
Zhang Ge,

1553
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,460
this time we need to record "Two Butterflies".

1554
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,935
You'll find out the reason during the show.

1555
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:27,535
And then,

1556
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,060
he took my phone and started singing.

1557
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,790
After he sang two lines,

1558
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,815
the whole room,

1559
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:32,440
including me,

1560
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,990
and all his staff,

1561
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,090
burst out laughing.

1562
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,490
And then?

1563
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,490
He asked, "What are you laughing at?"

1564
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,515
Then he picked up his phone and started recording a second take.

1565
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:40,240
After he finished recording,

1566
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,540
he handed me the phone and said it was done.

1567
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,115
Then I said,

1568
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,040
"Don't you want to listen to it?"

1569
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,265
"Are you okay with it?"

1570
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:44,740
He said,

1571
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,165
"It's fine."

1572
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:45,790
"It's pretty good."

1573
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,390
And then there's Brother Zhang.

1574
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:47,815
Yeah.

1575
00:54:47,815 --> 00:54:49,315
Just like Sister Jin said on the show,

1576
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:50,390
Brother Zhang is someone who...

1577
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,090
Very healthy and confident.

1578
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:53,965
A very cute person.

1579
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,340
He’s also not easily influenced by those around him.

1580
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:56,990
Yeah.

1581
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,290
And Zhang also mentioned it himself on the show.

1582
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,515
He said that every time they record the next day, he can’t remember what happened in the previous recording.

1583
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:03,815
There’s a detail—

1584
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:06,515
When Zhang was catching snakes in our tenth episode,

1585
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:09,965
an NPC brought out a handwritten calligraphy piece.

1586
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:11,640
It had the lyrics to "Apple Fragrance" on it.

1587
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,340
After reading it, he even asked Sister Ba,

1588
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,040
“Is this a song?”

1589
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,740
And during that recording,

1590
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,090
it was just a few days after the pilot episode had aired.

1591
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,340
After we finished recording and came out,

1592
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:20,715
I asked him,

1593
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:21,465
I said, “Zhang,”

1594
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:22,390
“Did you watch the pilot episode?”

1595
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,040
He said,

1596
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,465
“I did.”

1597
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:26,240
Then I asked, “Don’t you remember your iconic scene?”

1598
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,840
He looked confused and asked me what I meant.

1599
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:29,390
And then,

1600
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:30,515
he just—

1601
00:55:30,515 --> 00:55:32,690
he really couldn’t remember his iconic moment.

1602
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,390
It was when he sang "Apple Fragrance."

1603
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,250
Yeah.

1604
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,000
And there’s another cute thing about him.

1605
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,850
This season,

1606
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,250
we gave him some pretty exaggerated character settings.

1607
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:43,500
After reading the character card, he would comment on the character.

1608
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,900
He was quite famous at the time.

1609
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,600
One clue was that he would go to Dan for guidance on how to do a kissing scene.

1610
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,500
So I used a phrase from Teacher Zhao Lirong.

1611
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,725
After reading it, he said,

1612
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:53,950
“So this is how you film a kissing scene?”

1613
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,960
“How do you kiss like this? Tell me.”

1614
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,560
And didn't he wear women's clothes in that episode?

1615
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,635
Then after he saw that he tricked people by cross-dressing,

1616
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:01,210
he said to me,

1617
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,610
"Why do you keep giving me these weird roles?"

1618
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,760
And then,

1619
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,635
on our character cards, there are clues written.

1620
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:07,935
The details are in text form.

1621
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,060
Then I added a note in parentheses.

1622
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,110
It said, "Send a photo of yourself in women's clothes."

1623
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,260
Right after he complained about getting another weird role,

1624
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,210
after seeing that,

1625
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,245
there was a photo.

1626
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:19,420
He immediately asked me to show him what his cross-dressing photo looked like.

1627
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:20,470
And then,

1628
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:20,845
um,

1629
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,345
the next day, didn't he come to borrow my phone again?

1630
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:25,420
He took his photo and showed it to Jin Jie and the others.

1631
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,670
He mysteriously said it was his girlfriend.

1632
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,620
You just mentioned the kissing scene—

1633
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,195
Actually, on the show,

1634
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:36,820
Jin Jie would also tease and joke with him.

1635
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,490
When it comes to filming a lot of kissing scenes and such, he just takes everyone's teasing about it,

1636
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,390
including teasing him about his singing,

1637
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,590
and teasing him about his kissing scenes,

1638
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,065
does he mind it, or get sensitive or upset?

1639
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:48,365
No,

1640
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,440
he doesn't mind at all.

1641
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:49,990
Yeah,

1642
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,165
it's like when we accidentally hear him sing "Two Butterflies" and burst out laughing,

1643
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:54,990
he doesn't care at all.

1644
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,340
Yeah,

1645
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,315
he's just a very confident and positive

1646
00:56:57,315 --> 00:56:58,515
and easygoing person.

1647
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,440
And he understands that everyone

1648
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,290
means well,

1649
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,390
and is just having fun with him.

1650
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,740
So he never takes offense.

1651
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,990
Actually,

1652
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,040
even though we tease Ling He,

1653
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,690
in fact, at work,

1654
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,390
Zhang Linghe is a very serious and hardworking person.

1655
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:11,890
Yeah,

1656
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,440
no matter how late we finish filming each time,

1657
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:15,840
yeah,

1658
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,665
every time after filming,

1659
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:18,440
when it's already night,

1660
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,490
after finishing a segment, he comes out and asks me,

1661
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,940
"Is there anything I haven't filmed yet?"

1662
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
"Is there anything I haven't filmed yet?"

1663
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,930
And no matter how much I tell him is left,

1664
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:29,130
for example, I might list out a whole bunch of things that are still left to shoot,

1665
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,930
and he just says, "Okay."

1666
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:30,630
Yeah.

1667
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,105
That's how it is.

1668
00:57:31,105 --> 00:57:32,305
He never says a word about it.

1669
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:32,730
What?

1670
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,730
And when he's recording,

1671
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,105
for example, he might be wearing some jewelry,

1672
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:36,705
like a waist chain,

1673
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:38,080
or maybe a ring on his hand.

1674
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,330
Sometimes, he even drops them on set.

1675
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,230
Then during breaks,

1676
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,930
I pick them up and give them back to him.

1677
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:41,330
I say,

1678
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:41,605
Brother Zhang,

1679
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:42,355
you dropped your ring.

1680
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:43,030
And he replies,

1681
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,170
"Tell me about the content first,"

1682
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,220
"Don't worry about these things."

1683
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,620
He always puts the content first.

1684
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:53,070
I heard that once Sister Jin teased him,

1685
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,695
saying, "Brother Zhang, you really care about me."

1686
00:57:55,695 --> 00:57:58,370
"You keep messaging me to check if I've arrived."

1687
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,145
Yeah.

1688
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:00,345
Asking, "Where are you now?"

1689
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:03,220
"Has your flight landed yet?" and so on.

1690
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,235
It seems like he really cares about everyone.

1691
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,710
He pays attention to the recording schedule and whether everyone is tired.

1692
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,060
Yeah.

1693
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,685
That's right.

1694
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:12,985
For the first three recordings, Brother Zhang was filming,

1695
00:58:12,985 --> 00:58:15,210
so he always arrived at the hotel the latest, around 1 a.m.

1696
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:15,910
And then,

1697
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,660
even for the last recording,

1698
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,585
his plane had to make an emergency landing.

1699
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:22,435
After that, he took a car from Xiamen for over five hours to get here.

1700
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:24,210
So every time, he only arrived at 1 a.m.

1701
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,460
And every time he saw me,

1702
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,390
The first thing he asked me was whether everyone else had arrived.

1703
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,790
For example,

1704
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:29,640
I told him

1705
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,665
that someone hadn't arrived yet.

1706
00:58:30,665 --> 00:58:31,765
He then asked me who hadn't arrived.

1707
00:58:31,765 --> 00:58:32,565
When would they arrive?

1708
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:33,540
What time would they get here?

1709
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,215
He really cares about the others.

1710
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:37,090
He pays attention to everyone's situation.

1711
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,765
And then,

1712
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:39,315
during the last recording session,

1713
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,590
that day, both Sister Ba and Sister Jin didn't come.

1714
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,315
He asked me when they would arrive.

1715
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:44,590
What time was their flight?

1716
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,540
Anyway, he kept asking about it.

1717
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,240
He was always concerned about whether everyone had arrived.

1718
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,040
He might also mention it in the group chat.

1719
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,090
For example, during the second-to-last recording,

1720
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,115
it was raining heavily in Changsha that day.

1721
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,540
He changed his plans and took the high-speed train.

1722
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,040
Then his manager told me

1723
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,515
um,

1724
00:58:58,515 --> 00:59:01,798
it was thanks to Brother Zhang's quick decision to switch to the train.

1725
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:02,265
Otherwise,

1726
00:59:02,265 --> 00:59:03,190
we might have

1727
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,390
not made it on time either.

1728
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,740
And then,

1729
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,515
that day, Sister Jin was also delayed.

1730
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:06,790
And then,

1731
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,040
he kept telling Sister Jin

1732
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,265
to take the high-speed train too.

1733
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:11,215
He kept suggesting everyone take the train.

1734
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,540
He hoped everyone would have a smooth journey.

1735
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,235
And then

1736
00:59:14,235 --> 00:59:14,960
every time

1737
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,385
he also only arrives after one o'clock

1738
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:17,635
but when we rehearse the script

1739
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:20,660
he is still very serious and focused when rehearsing with me

1740
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,560
because I'm worried that if we rehearse too long, he'll get too tired

1741
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,160
and rest too late

1742
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,485
since we have to record early the next morning

1743
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:26,860
so every time I leave the script with him

1744
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,385
and he definitely keeps working on it by himself

1745
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:31,060
the next morning I ask him, "Brother Zhang,"

1746
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,660
"Do we need to review it again?" "No need."

1747
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,210
Then when it's time to tell the story

1748
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,060
he does it really well

1749
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,910
it's very reassuring

1750
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,310
Yeah

1751
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,960
he really does a lot of preparation on his own

1752
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,210
Right

1753
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,085
no matter how late it is

1754
00:59:39,085 --> 00:59:42,160
he always completes all the work he needs to do perfectly

1755
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:42,810
Yeah

1756
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,410
So, about that pirate episode

1757
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,610
at the beginning, he was holding a lizard in his hand

1758
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,810
how did you come up with the idea

1759
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,508
to create such a character for him

1760
00:59:53,508 --> 00:59:55,870
and give him that kind of entrance

1761
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:56,745
Yeah.

1762
00:59:56,745 --> 01:00:00,445
It was because that day we wanted to create the He Chongchong character for him.

1763
01:00:00,445 --> 01:00:03,620
So later, I asked his manager about it.

1764
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,345
I said,

1765
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:05,620
"Is Zhang afraid of lizards?"

1766
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,220
His manager said it should be fine.

1767
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,370
He likes these kinds of cute little creatures.

1768
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,845
So we prepared several lizards for him.

1769
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:12,370
And then,

1770
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:15,370
The lizard shown in the program was the one Zhang chose himself.

1771
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,460
He picked this one out of all the little lizards.

1772
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,960
And later, during the recording,

1773
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,260
When we went to check the set before recording,

1774
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,860
he kept playing with the lizard.

1775
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,760
He put the lizard into the cage.

1776
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,660
One of his clues wasn't in that house, right?

1777
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,710
It was originally placed on top.

1778
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,035
He even hid the clue deep inside.

1779
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:34,060
He hoped that when people got the clue,

1780
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,860
they would also interact with his little lizard.

1781
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,110
Everyone says

1782
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,735
that Zhang Linghe's looks this season are all very authoritative.

1783
01:00:40,735 --> 01:00:44,260
Has he ever said which look he likes best?

1784
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,910
Or which look he is most satisfied with?

1785
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:46,960
Yeah.

1786
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,485
Basically, every time there are several outfits for him to choose from.

1787
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:54,310
Actually, most of the looks shown on air are ones he picked himself.

1788
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:54,635
Yeah.

1789
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:57,760
He never specifically said which one he likes the most.

1790
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,520
He really likes looking cool.

1791
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,170
Whether it's his hairstyle or his clothes,

1792
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,570
Yeah.

1793
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,245
He just likes to look cool.

1794
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:03,920
And another thing is,

1795
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,970
Zhang is a really warm-hearted science and engineering guy.

1796
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,670
Because during our last recording session,

1797
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,395
he privately prepared small gifts for everyone.

1798
01:01:11,395 --> 01:01:12,070
And then,

1799
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,320
the gifts were sent directly to Dingnan.

1800
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,395
So after he arrived around 1 o'clock that day,

1801
01:01:16,395 --> 01:01:18,320
he just received those little gifts.

1802
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:18,790
And then,

1803
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:22,265
the gifts were little models of cats and dogs.

1804
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:23,590
But they were mechanical versions.

1805
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,490
They had little lights or small fans on them.

1806
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,790
So they could light up,

1807
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,440
or the little fans could spin.

1808
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,090
The way to turn on the lights or fans was pretty complicated.

1809
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,440
And then,

1810
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,540
after Zhang finished checking in around 1 o'clock,

1811
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,190
he took those things

1812
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,215
and started studying them one by one.

1813
01:01:38,215 --> 01:01:40,665
Because each one had a different way to turn on the light or fan.

1814
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,740
He had to figure out exactly

1815
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,510
how each one worked.

1816
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,485
How each little light turned on.

1817
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:47,510
He could spend a long time studying them.

1818
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,660
He had to get it all figured out.

1819
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,985
When it comes to hands-on things,

1820
01:01:49,985 --> 01:01:51,110
he really enjoys them.

1821
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,510
Okay.

1822
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,185
We've shared so many cute stories about Zhang.

1823
01:01:56,185 --> 01:01:58,260
Now let's move on to our youngest member.

1824
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,285
Little brother, can you share with us,

1825
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,310
your experience during this season's recording?

1826
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,500
How did you feel?

1827
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:05,325
Hmm.

1828
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:06,000
Sure.

1829
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:09,950
Before this season started,

1830
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:14,125
each PD actually talked with their players

1831
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,100
about some things to pay attention to this season.

1832
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,050
Because the format was updated this season.

1833
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,695
So when going over the guidelines and player manual for this season,

1834
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:25,470
our youngest was acting a bit cocky.

1835
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,470
He said, "I know, I've been a veteran for three seasons."

1836
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,470
For example, in the pilot episode,

1837
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:34,970
he immediately recognized that the host was played by the same actor as Cao Yangguang's father from season one.

1838
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:37,770
Then, during the third recording of "Pushing Billions,"

1839
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:39,295
he quickly recognized the intern

1840
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:41,320
as an actor who had appeared in the previous two seasons.

1841
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,460
Sometimes, during the recording on set,

1842
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,410
even during breaks,

1843
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:50,260
he would blurt out names from the previous two seasons.

1844
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,410
Like Bai Mai, He Dinghong, or Bazi Mei.

1845
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,285
For example, during the second recording,

1846
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:57,285
in episode four, we asked him a question

1847
01:02:57,285 --> 01:02:59,210
to check if he remembered the details.

1848
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,610
We asked him what his father's name was.

1849
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,060
He immediately answered, "My dad is Scientist,"

1850
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,180
which was his character's name from season two.

1851
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:06,730
He remembers all the details

1852
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,830
very well.

1853
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,180
When reviewing the character cards,

1854
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,930
he basically goes over them in advance.

1855
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,530
When he arrives at the scene

1856
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,580
just showing him the clues is enough.

1857
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,330
He can roughly figure out what story each clue corresponds to.

1858
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,630
Then he presents it in his own entertaining way.

1859
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,855
As for reasoning,

1860
01:03:25,855 --> 01:03:30,230
he's always sharp and occasionally throws out some key deductions.

1861
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:34,180
When searching for clues, he's still very proactive.

1862
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,830
Everyone can see this on the show.

1863
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,430
He searches for evidence in all kinds of positions.

1864
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,330
Like doing push-ups,

1865
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,630
or lying on the floor,

1866
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,630
and also

1867
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:42,770
searching online,

1868
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,170
or searching down low, things like that.

1869
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,495
And during discussions,

1870
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:48,970
if he notices someone needs to get clues from the front area,

1871
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,995
he'll also take the initiative to go get them.

1872
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,020
During filming,

1873
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:53,420
well,

1874
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,745
I think his favorite part is probably the small dining table segment.

1875
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,320
Basically, every time we record,

1876
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,770
he always asks me first if there will be a small dining table today.

1877
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,340
He has expressed it more than once.

1878
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,290
He really enjoys being with everyone.

1879
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:07,315
Especially on set during filming.

1880
01:04:07,315 --> 01:04:09,140
Just eating and chatting together.

1881
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:09,860
And then,

1882
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,485
Because the filming time for this season is limited,

1883
01:04:14,485 --> 01:04:18,610
we scheduled everything we could within the available time.

1884
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,185
But,

1885
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:22,335
sometimes when he eats alone,

1886
01:04:22,335 --> 01:04:25,810
he still thinks about the mysteries in his head.

1887
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,785
For example, during the recording of episode four,

1888
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:29,435
we had a short break.

1889
01:04:29,435 --> 01:04:32,260
The staff brought food to the room on set.

1890
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,785
When he saw the food,

1891
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:35,660
the first thing he said was that he was really hungry.

1892
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,598
He said he could eat three bowls of rice now.

1893
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:39,510
And even while eating,

1894
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,835
he kept thinking about the clues.

1895
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,610
Because the mystery in that episode was quite complicated.

1896
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,135
And also,

1897
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:48,435
besides always being focused on the mystery,

1898
01:04:48,435 --> 01:04:50,585
since he's the youngest member,

1899
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:52,885
he's still at an age where he loves to play.

1900
01:04:52,885 --> 01:04:53,610
He can be quite mischievous.

1901
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,085
He sometimes does some silly, over-the-top moves.

1902
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:57,810
Like playing with prop swords on set,

1903
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,010
or swinging sticks around.

1904
01:04:59,480 --> 01:04:59,905
And then,

1905
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:01,255
when playing the welfare club games,

1906
01:05:01,255 --> 01:05:02,605
his favorite choice is always the prop room.

1907
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:04,580
He often wants to pick handy weapons.

1908
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,055
Even if he draws a ridiculous weapon,

1909
01:05:07,055 --> 01:05:08,030
he still insists on choosing it.

1910
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:08,730
And then,

1911
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,055
for the "I Have Guts" game,

1912
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:10,880
he chose it twice.

1913
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,580
He didn't even remember that he had chosen this before.

1914
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,030
Then,

1915
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:16,230
in the end, when he made his last choice,

1916
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,130
I finally got brave enough

1917
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,630
to tell him, "You've picked this prop before."

1918
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:19,105
He said, "It's fine."

1919
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:19,905
"I still want this one."

1920
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:20,530
So then,

1921
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,385
that prop was given to him during the recording of episode nine.

1922
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:30,010
Also, he would come up with some fun catchphrases for his own character.

1923
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,110
For example, the slogan for Ke Ankan was his own idea.

1924
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,810
And during the second recording,

1925
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,960
when I told him about the pun in the name "Ke Wu Wang,"

1926
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,410
I explained that "Ke Ke Wu Wang" means "Ke Wu Wang Kuang."

1927
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,135
He said,

1928
01:05:42,135 --> 01:05:44,310
"Then I hope I won't be 'Ke Wu Wang Kuang' today."

1929
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,250
Because that day, he was the detective.

1930
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,900
And since he had rushed over from the set overnight,

1931
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,350
he was worried he might not be at his best.

1932
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,950
Then, in the fourth case,

1933
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,450
his storyline included a butterfly bracelet.

1934
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:03,000
Actually, that was a little crossover with his brother's show, "Sniper Butterfly."

1935
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,520
When he saw his own storyline, he felt a bit embarrassed.

1936
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,670
He just laughed.

1937
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,395
And at the end of the recording,

1938
01:06:09,395 --> 01:06:11,920
he asked me if he could have the bracelet.

1939
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:13,845
So after that recording,

1940
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,545
I gave her the bracelet.

1941
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,020
Because she really liked it.

1942
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,395
And when she arrived on set,

1943
01:06:19,395 --> 01:06:24,170
you'd notice she really enjoyed playing with props together with Bai Ge.

1944
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,170
Ever since she got that prop during the first recording,

1945
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:28,145
It should be called a detector, right?

1946
01:06:28,145 --> 01:06:30,345
That, that stick warning device.

1947
01:06:30,345 --> 01:06:32,720
When they got the stick from the warning device,

1948
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,520
the two of them started playing with it.

1949
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,995
Then, during the second recording,

1950
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:37,045
they played with the bullfighting prop in He Chongchong's room.

1951
01:06:37,045 --> 01:06:38,470
The two of them lay on the floor and started to fight.

1952
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,245
Then, the third time,

1953
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:42,620
they were playing with the Prince Charming doll.

1954
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,370
They went to tell Baige, "I found you."

1955
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,070
Prince Charming.

1956
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,380
And then,

1957
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,305
including,

1958
01:06:46,305 --> 01:06:47,655
during the last time,

1959
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:49,180
they played with the prop lightsaber.

1960
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,980
They were really quite childish at those times.

1961
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,855
Including during the third recording,

1962
01:06:54,855 --> 01:06:57,955
after being bitten by the monster in the story,

1963
01:06:57,955 --> 01:07:00,055
he realized he would be playing the monster later.

1964
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:00,355
And then,

1965
01:07:00,355 --> 01:07:03,305
while filming on set with Baige and the others,

1966
01:07:03,305 --> 01:07:05,580
the two of them started to improvise our storyline.

1967
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,170
Then they started making up identities.

1968
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,620
Monster henchman

1969
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,845
King of monsters

1970
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:11,370
These were actually pretty interesting.

1971
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,770
There was a moment when they were waiting to break into the city.

1972
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:19,445
He gathered all the NPCs together.

1973
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:20,845
Then he gave instructions there.

1974
01:07:20,845 --> 01:07:21,020
Come on.

1975
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,120
Everyone, listen to my plan.

1976
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,695
When we go in later,

1977
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:24,020
we'll chase after Zhang Linghe and bite him.

1978
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,420
We want revenge, right?

1979
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:25,795
Right.

1980
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:26,920
Settle the score on the spot.

1981
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,845
It's kind of like the feeling of two rival brothers.

1982
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:30,695
Love and rivalry.

1983
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:32,170
Actually, he was following all along.

1984
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,490
Lin He was playing over there.

1985
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,490
And Lin He was up ahead, focused on looking for his plants.

1986
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,140
He didn't even realize the person tugging at him was his younger brother.

1987
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,290
Then, before breaking through the wall,

1988
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:47,265
he noticed that Bai Ge had quietly hidden behind the background actor.

1989
01:07:47,265 --> 01:07:49,190
He immediately pulled him to the front.

1990
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,690
It meant the two of them had to lead the charge together.

1991
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:56,625
As for him, the things he always carries with him

1992
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,600
are his candy and a small fan.

1993
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,525
As for the candy,

1994
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:02,200
he sometimes uses it to refresh himself.

1995
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,500
He'll eat some small candies,

1996
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,050
and also eat bread or other snacks provided on site.

1997
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,550
As for the small fan,

1998
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:08,950
well,

1999
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,730
he's actually quite sensitive to heat.

2000
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,105
So every time there's a recording,

2001
01:08:12,105 --> 01:08:14,180
he basically always brings a small fan with him.

2002
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:14,655
He says

2003
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:16,105
if everyone feels hot on set,

2004
01:08:16,105 --> 01:08:17,630
they can all use it together.

2005
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,130
Also,

2006
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,030
his team

2007
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,530
takes care of him like looking after a child or a younger brother.

2008
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:26,280
They'll leave his water bottle, coffee, and snacks with me.

2009
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,455
They'll also tell me

2010
01:08:27,455 --> 01:08:29,680
so that if he gets hungry on set, he can eat anytime.

2011
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,005
But basically, he just eats whatever is prepared on site.

2012
01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:37,730
The team usually keeps some snacks with me.

2013
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:40,330
For example, once when I brought him coffee on set,

2014
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,455
his team was worried he hadn't eaten.

2015
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:44,380
So they asked me to bring him some food.

2016
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,130
But he just held the little bread that Ba Jie gave him and said it was enough for him.

2017
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,080
No need

2018
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,590
to give him any more food.

2019
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,890
Although he still seems a bit childish,

2020
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,640
and a bit immature,

2021
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:59,690
he's actually very considerate in many small ways.

2022
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,365
For example, on set,

2023
01:09:01,365 --> 01:09:03,540
he'll take the initiative to help everyone carry things.

2024
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,515
Like evidence boxes,

2025
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,165
clues,

2026
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:09,115
when he goes back to the evidence area to get clues,

2027
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:14,090
if he sees anyone's forgotten notebooks, he'll bring them back to the discussion area for everyone.

2028
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:14,755
And then

2029
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:15,930
about the pool segment

2030
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,605
it was the last part on the first day of filming

2031
01:09:18,605 --> 01:09:18,955
And then

2032
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,130
since he was on a solo track

2033
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,530
at that time, everyone didn't know he actually wasn't eliminated

2034
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,380
And then

2035
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,330
when he realized he could leave through that window

2036
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:32,855
before leaving the pool, he took out all the clothes, jackets, and notebooks everyone had left in the room

2037
01:09:32,855 --> 01:09:34,530
and brought them back to the lounge

2038
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,930
then handed them out to the others

2039
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:37,980
And on set

2040
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,455
sometimes, when he saw people squatting for a long time, he would take the initiative to find stools

2041
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:43,530
and offer them to everyone

2042
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:44,530
And then

2043
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:46,930
during the rappelling segment

2044
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:50,980
that day, Didi was paired with Sister Jin for the descent

2045
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,980
he actually controlled his speed during the descent

2046
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,780
he would wait for Sister Jin to come down slowly

2047
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,230
and stayed with her the whole time

2048
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,745
constantly comforting her

2049
01:10:00,745 --> 01:10:01,370
and encouraging her

2050
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,720
After returning to the lounge

2051
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,220
he told the team

2052
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,370
that he felt really bad seeing Sister Jin cry

2053
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,345
so after the rappelling ended

2054
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:11,070
the first thing he asked was, "Have you recovered?"

2055
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:15,070
he was genuinely concerned about whether Sister Jin was feeling better

2056
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,770
And then

2057
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,545
there were also some small details

2058
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:20,420
for example, during one recording

2059
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,935
when we arrived the day before

2060
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:22,710
there was a heavy rainstorm in Changsha

2061
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,835
he even asked me

2062
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:24,785
if everyone had arrived

2063
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:25,610
if everyone had landed safely

2064
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:26,760
he also mentioned

2065
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,485
that his flight time was quite lucky

2066
01:10:29,485 --> 01:10:31,835
he landed just before the storm

2067
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:35,710
and for example, when we played some

2068
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,900
During the segment

2069
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,450
For example, when we were playing that Chinese horror game

2070
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,350
Like when Baige went in

2071
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,125
it would hold up the lantern above

2072
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,650
just to prevent Baige from bumping her head

2073
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,250
But

2074
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:49,075
it's the kind that doesn't really express with words

2075
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:53,650
but more often shows our close relationship through actions

2076
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,075
and that I care about you a lot

2077
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:56,250
That's basically the kind of person it is

2078
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,835
On the contrary, the more his older brothers and sisters tease him,

2079
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:00,960
the more embarrassed he gets.

2080
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,835
And the harder it is for him to express himself.

2081
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:03,110
That's the kind of person he is.

2082
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:03,810
Yeah.

2083
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,110
Fans have a few more questions they'd like to ask.

2084
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,735
When the professionally trained cast member gets the role of the culprit,

2085
01:11:09,735 --> 01:11:11,360
does he get nervous?

2086
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,510
This season, for Keyu,

2087
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:17,860
I think the biggest change in his reasoning is that when he gets the culprit role,

2088
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,710
he's obviously much more relaxed.

2089
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,940
He doesn't get nervous anymore.

2090
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,440
When others start to suspect him,

2091
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,090
and try to guess if he's the culprit,

2092
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:30,915
he can actually handle it very smoothly.

2093
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:32,940
He even throws out some clues,

2094
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,115
not only to defend himself,

2095
01:11:35,115 --> 01:11:38,790
but also to increase suspicion on others.

2096
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,365
But actually, when he first gets the culprit card in private,

2097
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,590
he's still quite nervous.

2098
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,470
It's just that

2099
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:48,020
he still feels that playing the culprit is difficult.

2100
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,720
During the third recording,

2101
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,070
he was the culprit for two cases in a row.

2102
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,595
At that time, during a break,

2103
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:55,645
when he was changing his mic,

2104
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,870
the first thing he asked me was, "Am I the culprit this episode?"

2105
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:59,420
I said to him,

2106
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,345
then I told him,

2107
01:12:00,345 --> 01:12:02,220
I said, "Yes, you're the culprit this episode."

2108
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,820
At that moment, he kind of lost his composure.

2109
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,890
It's like, how did he end up getting the role of the culprit again?

2110
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,490
But his performance on the show was still very relaxed.

2111
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,990
He was able to improvise a lot on the spot with ease.

2112
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,390
That's basically it.

2113
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,590
Both the professionally trained and Gudelake have dramatic storylines.

2114
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:23,215
Does your brother share with you when it comes to the drama storylines?

2115
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:26,040
When he sees the storylines of the professionally trained and Gudelake,

2116
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,960
he just laughs at those storylines.

2117
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,635
When he's watching those scenes himself,

2118
01:12:29,635 --> 01:12:30,210
he just laughs.

2119
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,160
It was during the Gudelake episode.

2120
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,560
After the family recognition part, they went to the lounge.

2121
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,960
When they were about to take a break and eat,

2122
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:38,685
they were still on the way.

2123
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:40,660
He commented that the character relationships in this episode

2124
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,510
were really imaginative.

2125
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:45,410
It was obvious that he was very happy to play the father in that episode.

2126
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,250
Let's also thank Xiaojie for sharing.

2127
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,650
Today, everyone has actually shared a lot.

2128
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:55,200
The performances of our six guests on the show

2129
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,900
Lastly, we have some questions from netizens.

2130
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,850
Everyone can answer them.

2131
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,550
So the first question is, in this season,

2132
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:06,100
who do you think has become the most courageous?

2133
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:06,670
Ning Ge.

2134
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:07,820
Ning Ge.

2135
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,070
Without a doubt.

2136
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:11,270
It's definitely Ning Ge.

2137
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,820
That day, I saw you all wore matching outfits to pick them up.

2138
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,020
Did they react when they saw you?

2139
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,270
They jumped.

2140
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,870
Alright, alright.

2141
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,920
Jin Jie really likes this sense of unity.

2142
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,320
She had a custom outfit made for everyone on their team.

2143
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:30,020
Because at the very beginning, during that Qianbaiyi Film and TV company event,

2144
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:30,745
she showed up.

2145
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:32,370
At that time, the older sister was wearing a "pain shirt."

2146
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,020
So how did everyone end up deciding that you all should wear "pain shirts"?

2147
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,970
Maybe we should especially ask Ba-jie's younger brother about this.

2148
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:42,445
Because back then, it was at Tebai Film and TV company,

2149
01:13:42,445 --> 01:13:43,920
didn't Jin-jie have one?

2150
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,170
Later, we thought,

2151
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,880
let's make one for everyone.

2152
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,305
After everyone had one,

2153
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:49,530
why did the PD wear one too?

2154
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,030
Honestly, it was just to surprise them.

2155
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,980
So how did they react when they saw you all?

2156
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:56,630
They were surprised.

2157
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:57,180
And a little shocked.

2158
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,930
People really do laugh when they're at a loss for words.

2159
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,405
After Ning and his team saw it, they all said

2160
01:14:05,405 --> 01:14:06,280
"You guys put so much thought into this."

2161
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,335
The team thought it was actually pretty cute when they saw it.

2162
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,560
The production team really put a lot of effort into the preparations.

2163
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:16,660
A staff member from Baige pulled me over to take a photo with him.

2164
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:22,960
What everyone probably cares about most is the fourth season of "Let's Start Reasoning."

2165
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:25,460
Everyone also wants to know if we

2166
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,995
will have a fourth season.

2167
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:31,870
And whether the six of us will continue to participate.

2168
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,620
Didn't we mention this in episode ten?

2169
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,295
It was, what, 103 jin?

2170
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:40,320
I hope he always keeps his strengths.

2171
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,320
And of course, we hope it will be the original cast.

2172
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,880
We actually mentioned this at the beginning.

2173
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,080
We're already starting to prepare for the fourth season.

2174
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,955
We're also working hard to plan a team-building event for everyone.

2175
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:59,055
We hope to see everyone again soon.

2176
01:14:59,055 --> 01:14:59,430
Mm-hmm.

2177
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,180
Alright.

2178
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,255
Thank you to our six PDs today as well.

2179
01:15:03,255 --> 01:15:04,230
So today,

2180
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,660
this round of sharing secrets ends here.

2181
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,960
Maybe next season we'll have more to share with everyone.

2182
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,335
Okay.

2183
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:12,735
Goodbye.

2184
01:15:12,735 --> 01:15:13,210
Bye-bye.

2185
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:13,760
Bye-bye.
