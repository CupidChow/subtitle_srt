1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,320
A large number of monsters suddenly appeared in the hell training camp.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
The infected are closing in step by step.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,800
Why did a biological infection suddenly break out in the camp?

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
And how is all this related to the mysterious death of

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,720
the red-haired man?

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
What is the connection?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
The sudden rain has just stopped.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,560
But the mist still lingers.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,280
They decide to risk themselves.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,480
Why is it shaking?

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,120
Returning to the neighboring factory to investigate the truth.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,760
After an initial investigation,

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
the people involved in this case have been identified.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,440
Definitely confirmed.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,920
When he was hit,

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
he was already...

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,720
I think we can accept this.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,560
Today, we really can jump.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Come on, like this, I'm the detective.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,440
Everyone, close your eyes.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
The person knocking on the wall, open your eyes secretly.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
I won't say it, okay?

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,400
I won't tell, alright?

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,360
Alright.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay.

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
So one of you is...

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,720
Right.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
Then let's go over your backgrounds.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,520
Because I think we can definitely rule him out.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,560
Because all four of you are...

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,160
Then let's just make it consistent.

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
Why does he have one extra?

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
What about this evidence?

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,800
So he's ruled out.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,680
2008 is open.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,400
I don't know why either.

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,520
Because 2003 plus 5

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,440
equals 2008.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,680
So it's 2008.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,440
Then I could also say

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
2000 plus 8 equals 2008.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,760
So it's 2008, right?

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,360
Right, then it's even more likely to be 2008.

45
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,680
Because we did two calculations

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,360
and both answers are 2008.

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,080
Then I could also say 2001 plus 7

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,040
Right, that's even more so.

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
2002 plus 6

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Still has to be the "culprit."

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,080
It's a classic either-or.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,960
At this very moment,

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
put a detective here,

54
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,120
one of us must be the culprit.

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Who do you think it is?

56
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,760
Classic either-or.

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,480
I think it's you.

58
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,840
I think it's you.

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,840
What's the point?

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
What's the point?

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,640
What's the point?

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
That's right, our classic either-or choice, that's right.

64
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
This way of thinking is correct.

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
So you two are out.

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,600
Now it's just you two.

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
Alright, classic either-or.

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,480
I think it really feels like an either-or.

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Because one has been there.

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,480
And one stayed with us.

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,160
Right.

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
So what about the last person?

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
Don't worry about me.

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,560
You just go your own way.

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,800
At critical moments, you still have to count on me, right?

76
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,600
You take the director with you.

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,160
I've decided to stick with my zombie brothers.

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,520
Live and die together.

79
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
No, it's fine.

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
I don't mind you.

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
No.

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,080
I think it's time for me to

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
make some contributions to this team.

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
What do you mean?

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,200
No.

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Your smile is a bit sarcastic.

87
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,120
Your smile is a bit sarcastic.

88
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Forced sacrifice.

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,040
No hardship, just toughing it out.

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
No hardship, just toughing it out.

91
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm going to take the zombies and go far away.

92
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll organize my zombie army in the distance.

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,480
I'll come back to challenge you another day.

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,840
How about that?

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
If you make that "ah-woo" sound again,

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,280
I took some time to practice my lines.

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
I was in the bathroom over here.

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't hear you practicing your lines.

99
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,280
I was practicing quietly.

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
It's just that

101
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,480
I wanted to run away.

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
I treated staying there as if

103
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,720
I had run away myself.

104
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Yeah.

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,240
When I was telling my story,

106
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Did I say

107
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,120
that I wanted to work hard to become something?

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
So that the parents who abandoned me

109
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
would regret leaving me?

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,519
So am I safe now?

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
Hello, everyone.

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,800
Hello, everyone.

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
Welcome to our city, Tui.

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
This is Tui City's video log.

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,320
Right now, we're on the aerial camera.

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
You can see one of the buildings in Tui City.

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,960
Let's take a look, there are two more people over there.

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,320
We're heading to the top of the mountain now.

119
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Hold on tight.

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

121
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,000
Take this and do it like this.

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,680
Like this.

123
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
Get rid of all of them.

124
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,640
There's food.

125
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,320
There's food, right?

126
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Wait a second.

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
Let's not go up yet, let's distract them first.

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,880
Hurry up and go.

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
Take this, I got it.

130
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,560
Then those people won't be able to catch you.

131
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
And you won't get infected.

132
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Hurry, get him out of here.

133
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait a moment.

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,320
Yes.

135
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
There, over there.

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,440
Right, it should be him.

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,320
That's right.

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,480
Didn't we also see that...

139
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,440
They said there was a figure with red hair.

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah.

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,600
And then?

142
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,920
Then they said he really looked like that person.

143
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,480
Plus, according to his timeline,

144
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
he was already there after 8 p.m.

145
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
So actually, before he was smashed to death

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
or stabbed to death,

147
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
he had already...

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,240
Let's hide for now.

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
Where should we hide?

150
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
How about we just "beat him" to death?

151
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,920
We can physically hit his head.

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,200
Hit him.

153
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
No.

154
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,560
Let's both hit him.

155
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
Okay.

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,440
Hit the "zombie."

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,360
Then give him this stick.

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,040
You two go hit him.

159
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
Hurry, lure him, go lure him.

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll drink the sour one.

161
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm good at drinking sour things.

162
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,960
You drink it.

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,640
I can drink bitter, but I can't handle spicy.

164
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Then I'll take the spicy one.

165
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,640
You take the spicy.

166
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
I think they're equally sour.

167
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Impossible.

168
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
Let me try it.

169
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll bring them all over first.

170
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
Look at the color.

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,240
Which one?

172
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
Actually, they're the same color.

173
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
Then I'll try it, come on.

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,360
It's spicy.

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,920
I think this is a loophole.

176
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,640
What's the reason?

177
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
You've already had something spicy once.

179
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,400
After that,

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
you actually won't feel much difference.

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
Let me use this bitter one to rinse.

182
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,680
Only one person can go through at a time.

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,440
So who goes first?

184
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
I'll go.

185
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:50,920
Like this.

186
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:51,880
Like this.

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
What about my legs then?

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,120
If I snap, won't you just...

189
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,400
No.

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,920
I'll squat and walk like this.

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Let's make a plan first.

192
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,920
You two go out to distract.

193
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
Then the two of us will go out to catch them.

194
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,320
You two are in charge of watching the door.

195
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay.

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,160
Is that alright?

197
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Alright.

198
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,440
Fine.

199
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,360
Let me share an idea.

200
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
If the one from four years ago is...

201
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
Is it possible that someone was replaced here?

202
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,280
And then left.

203
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,160
The year 2020.

204
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
Graduated after 2024.

205
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,520
The one who graduated with us.

206
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
Among the six of us.

207
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,880
What is this?

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,240
Does this make me invisible?

209
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,400
Is this invisible now?

210
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
Invisibility cloak

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,160
Invisibility cloak

212
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Go ahead, pull him out.

213
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
You're invisible right now.

214
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,800
I can't see you at all now.

215
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,120
This is invisibility.

216
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,880
This is really invisible.

217
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
You try it, you put on the invisibility cloak.

218
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,520
Yeah, just like this.

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to take a shower.

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,480
Take a shower.

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
Lemon bitter melon

222
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Let me teach you a method, come here.

223
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Use a straw.

224
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,400
No, look at the color.

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,640
The darkest one.

226
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,680
This one.

227
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,200
The bitter one is done.

228
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Number twenty-two.

229
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
I was in the bathroom taking care of my mouth.

230
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,720
And why is that?

231
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Because I'm worried there might be a kissing scene.

232
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,680
You're lying, I didn't see you.

233
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
Because I had diarrhea.

234
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
I was taking care of my mouth.

235
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,560
I didn't do it in the stall.

236
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
How do you do this?

237
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,320
Have you opened this before?

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,760
No, I haven't.

239
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,480
Why is it shaking?

240
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm watching it.

241
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,600
It's fine, don't worry.

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,520
You go out first, it's okay.

243
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Go.

244
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,480
Got it.

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
I have a great idea.

246
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,320
First, once the barrel is sealed, it's invincible.

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
Send out a sealed barrel.

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,680
He's inside.

249
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Attract them.

250
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,680
After everyone gathers around,

251
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,560
the five of us, while their backs are turned,

252
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
will just grab that person over.

253
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Finally,

254
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
we'll take the person in the barrel

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
and leave them outside to "wait for death."

256
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,480
Leave them outside to "wait for death."

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,760
Right.

258
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
Okay, go out and seal it right away.

259
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Good luck.

260
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,480
It's open.

261
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Let's go. I'm going.

262
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Okay, again.

263
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Three, two, one, go.

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,360
Go.

265
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,080
Go.

266
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
This—let me tell you about this.

267
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
Look, when this thing appears,

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
it definitely means there will be

269
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
this point.

270
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
That's right.

271
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,400
Now I have a question.

272
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,200
First, one is

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,920
physical death.

274
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
The other is

275
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,160
now, this thing

276
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,600
he's had it since he was a child.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,040
Yes.

278
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,600
Today, his

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
is just inevitable.

280
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,040
Wait a moment.

281
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
This is

282
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Right here is

283
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
No need to move.

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
After he finished killing, the red hair just

285
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
he mutated.

286
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,280
Then he ran to the stairs.
