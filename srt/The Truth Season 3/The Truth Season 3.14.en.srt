1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,040
The real culprit is

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,240
Bai Huanzi

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,760
Is there an X in this episode

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,440
Sister Ba

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,960
You two really make a great pair today

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,320
I just wanted everyone to think it was impossible

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
I am the culprit in this case.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,840
Bai Hanzi

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,880
After discovering An Wenzhe

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,240
was the mastermind behind my daughter's death,

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,600
I started plotting in my dormitory

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
how I could kill him

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,480
to avenge my daughter.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,800
But he brought his men with him,

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,280
so I didn't dare to act rashly.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
I quietly came to Tan Qian's office.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,440
I stood at the entrance to the secret room.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,120
I overheard An Wenzhe making a phone call inside.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,040
But I couldn't hear it very clearly.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,360
Fortunately, when I came to look for the computer earlier,

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
I had already been inside the secret room once.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,600
I took the voice recorder.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,440
And the factory's power remote control.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Just in case.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,760
I quickly used the recorder to capture the conversation.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,000
An Wenzhe seemed to notice something was missing.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,920
He was discussing the next steps with his subordinates.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,120
He actually plans to wait until everyone is asleep

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,600
and drug us to knock us out.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Then tie us up on the second floor.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,760
And then kill us.

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,360
It must be because

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
he's afraid that we

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
will expose the factory's illegal livestreaming activities.

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,240
And as the boss, he would be held responsible.

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,360
So he wants to kill us to eliminate any future trouble.

37
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,520
Since he has already arranged for his men to leave,

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,720
I just need to eat aloe leaves in advance

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
to avoid being drugged.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
Then ambush him when he puts his plan into action.

41
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,240
To be absolutely sure,

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
I plan to use the strong sleeping spray from yesterday

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,440
to knock him out first, then take action.

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
After leaving Tan Qian's office,

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
I quickly went to the workshop and ate a piece of aloe.

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,560
Then I found the

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,920
strong sleep spray I discovered yesterday.

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
I brought it back to the dormitory.

49
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,520
I also prepared a small knife.

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,200
I lay on the bed and pretended to be drugged.

51
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,120
An Wenzhe had probably already used the sedative.

52
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,520
I heard some sounds of objects being moved.

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,720
When he moved me to the second floor,

54
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I quietly observed.

55
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,800
I waited for the right moment.

56
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,360
I noticed

57
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
that around the livestream room

58
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,720
many cut wires had already been set up.

59
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,440
He probably wanted to tie us up here after drugging us.

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,400
Then go out, pull the switch, and turn on the power.

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
So that we would all be electrocuted.

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
I thought for a moment.

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
I decided to use his method of killing us

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
to fake an accident and kill him instead.

65
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,360
Very carefully,

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,040
I used the knife to cut the rope tying me.

67
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
After An Wenzhe finished tying up the last person,

68
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,920
I took out a strong sleeping spray and knocked him out.

69
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,600
Then I searched his pockets.

70
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,320
I found out that the drug he used lasts for six hours.

71
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
I decided to go along with it.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,320
I made a delay device.

73
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,120
After everyone wakes up and unties themselves,

74
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
they will all discover together

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
that An Wenzhe had died unexpectedly.

76
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,480
This creates a perfect alibi.

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
I turned off the circuit breaker for the second-floor streaming room.

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,240
I moved An Wenzhe

79
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,000
to the circuit breaker box outside the streaming room.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
I placed his hand

81
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
on the handle of the second-floor streaming room's circuit breaker.

82
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,560
Then I poured a puddle of water at his feet.

83
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
I made sure the soles of his cloth shoes were soaked with water.

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,400
Next, I placed an electric wire

85
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
on the wet spot near his feet.

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Then I used a remote control

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
to turn off the power on the first floor of the factory.

88
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,280
I tied one end of a flammable packing rope

89
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,880
to the handle of the second-floor streaming room's circuit breaker.

90
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,000
The other end extended to the back door on the first floor.

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I used extra-strong adhesive tape

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
to stick it onto the conveyor belt.

93
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,880
When the first-floor power was turned on again,

94
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,720
the conveyor belt would start running,

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
pulling the rope

96
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,760
and opening the second-floor streaming room's circuit breaker.

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
This would electrify the wire and kill An Wenzhe.

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,280
To make the rope disappear,

99
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,600
I tied a match to the rope.

100
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,280
Inside the conveyor belt,

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
on the safety warning text on the wall,

102
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,280
I stuck some match-striking phosphorus.

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
After the conveyor belt started running,

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
the match would ignite when it struck the phosphorus.

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
This would burn the rope completely.

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
After finishing all this,

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
I carefully pressed open the second-floor door

108
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,280
and entered the streaming room area again.

109
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Then, imitating An Wenzhe's method,

110
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,280
I used a new rope of the same type I had prepared

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,880
to tie myself up again.

112
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,960
After everyone woke up

113
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,480
I secretly turned on the power on the first floor of the factory

114
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,080
and threw the remote control in an inconspicuous place

115
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,720
The conveyor belt started running

116
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,480
The wires in the second-floor live streaming room

117
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
really started to spark

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
and successfully electrocuted An Wenzhe

119
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
When we broke out of the door

120
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,320
the rope had already burned through

121
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
The scene looked

122
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
as if An Wenzhe came to turn on the power switch

123
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,200
and tried to electrocute us

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,080
but accidentally got electrocuted himself

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,760
You really picked something I'm best at.

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
Admitting defeat too soon.

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
I can pick up several at once.

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Wait, you can't pick them up like that.

129
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Restart the timer.

130
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
You have to pick them up one by one.

131
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
Today's options are the golden spoon and

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
the Ba Fen candy.

133
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
I choose Ba Fen candy.

134
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,160
Because there's no way the two of us

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,800
could work together

136
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
for two rounds in a row, right?

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,880
A little scared.

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,240
No response.

139
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,840
We're not going to just stay here all day, are we?

140
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,920
No, we won't.

141
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Are you the killer?

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you the killer?

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
Why do you care if I'm the killer?

144
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,320
They're all dead.

145
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
We can't take part anymore.

146
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
They won't die. They're not dead.

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
They're definitely already dead.

148
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,960
Can the killer die? Think about it.

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
The killer can't possibly die.

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
The killer will definitely escape.

151
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
How could they die here?

152
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
Heniba

153
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
Stop guessing.

154
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
Feigning death is also possible.

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Hurry up and kill me.

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,720
Confirm.

157
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
Come on, I'll stand over there and watch.

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't think we should go easy on them today.

159
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,160
Get closer, right up to their face.

160
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Come on, grab two chairs.

161
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,440
There are just five of us coming in.

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,000
No need.

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,640
We'll just stand at the door in a bit.

164
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Wait at the door.

165
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,040
We'll do it like this in a bit.

166
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,960
Stand in a row and watch her.

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
Treat it the same way, don't overthink it.

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,720
You don't have to.

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Just stay there and think it through.

170
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
Think about how you're going to act later.

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
I also want to see the Ba Fen Tang performance.

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
She's here, she's here.

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,560
That was fast.

174
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,800
Why are you guys like this?

175
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
What do you mean?

176
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,640
Let's see if you're X.

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
That's pretty cool.

178
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,360
We should take a picture.

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Change the subject.

180
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,960
You're blushing.

181
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,400
How could I not blush with four people looking at me like that?

182
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,280
Okay.

183
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,640
I'll wait here too.

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,880
I knew it would be that confident look.

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
"Innocent" is written all over my face.

186
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
I don't want to watch anymore.

187
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
I've seen enough.

188
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,280
I can't keep watching.

189
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,520
Hello, little assassin.

190
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,840
Can the killer die?

191
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Think about it.

192
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,400
My motive for killing is that I was afraid.

193
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
You were afraid?

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,120
Afraid.

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,800
You were afraid?

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,520
I was afraid too.

197
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,240
I was afraid too.

198
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,520
What were you afraid of?

199
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I was afraid he would kill me.

200
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
Who would kill you?

201
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
Wasn't it Tan who wanted to kill you?

202
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Okay.

203
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
You were afraid he would kill you.

204
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
How did you know he wanted to kill you?

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
I'm going to say it now.

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
Let me speak, okay?

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
You just keep asking me.

208
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
If you don't let me talk, how will you know?

209
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,520
Go ahead.

210
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,640
Wasn't I in his room yesterday?

211
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
I found that laptop.

212
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Yes.

213
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
Four comic cards.

214
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,040
Yes.

215
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,080
Ning, did you notice?

216
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Unlocked with your birthdays

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,800
None of you remember what happened yesterday

218
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,760
You just keep doing this

219
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,440
You think you can be sure about him just from a comic card

220
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
My brain just doesn't work well

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
My brain just doesn't work well

222
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,080
I just think those four ways to die

223
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,920
are the ways he wants to kill me

224
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
That's what I believe

225
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm just stubborn, single-minded

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,000
I feel like something's off about this

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,880
But that comic card

228
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,640
has the four of us on it

229
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,920
All four of us are perfectly fine

230
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,720
So why do you think

231
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
that this comic card will definitely

232
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,320
prove that he wants to kill you

233
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,800
Because when I found it

234
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
I only unlocked my own

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,680
My own

236
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,040
It's far-fetched, everyone's already started dancing

237
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,920
He doesn't want to get caught up in the whirlpool of this incident

238
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,960
This is the rope—the one they used to tie us up, right?

239
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Yes.

240
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
I understand.

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,480
This person escaped on their own before.

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
And then tied themselves up again.

243
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,400
What are you talking about?

244
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Didn't you drop your key here?

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
Haven't you been here before?

246
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Why did you come here?

247
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,320
You just mentioned a key piece of information.

248
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,640
You said you dropped it while escaping, right?

249
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
After I found out about the comic card incident,

250
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,360
I thought he wanted to kill me.

251
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,560
To confirm this idea,

252
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,320
I decided to take a look.

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
To see if the two doors of our factory were open.

254
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
Because I wanted to leave this place.

255
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,560
So I went over there.

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,760
I also came here.

257
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
That's why I dropped this key here.

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,960
But that has nothing to do with me.

259
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,720
You didn't notice?

260
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,240
I didn't notice.

261
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,320
Aren't these two different things?

262
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,480
I've been here.

263
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,560
You've been here? Why?

264
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
I passed by here when I went to the second floor.

265
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
Right, then let's count him in too.

266
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,800
Then let's talk about the two detectives.

267
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,120
Do you have any suspicions?

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
Any suspects?

269
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Except for the one who isn't suspected,

270
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
the other three all seem suspicious.

271
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
Which one isn't suspected?

272
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,160
He's not suspected? No.

273
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
He's not suspected? No.

274
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,520
Wasn't he the first one to be ruled out?

275
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,960
Do you think the one he ruled out

276
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
has a solid alibi?

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,560
Actually, it's not very conclusive.

278
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
But just now, everyone deduced

279
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,040
that he was the least

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,400
suspicious.

281
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,120
It's because when he stole that notebook,

282
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,360
he had already left the scene.

283
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
He didn't know what was going to happen.

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,520
He stole it at 12:15.

285
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,320
By 12:30, he was already in his dorm.

286
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,880
Right.

287
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,840
After that, he stayed in his dorm the whole time.

288
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,160
But actually, that's wrong.

289
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
Just now, I also thought we should rule him out.

290
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
But then I thought again, look,

291
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,880
when he stole the item, he saw

292
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
maybe

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,520
the boss wanted to kill you.

294
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,520
Right?

295
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
That comic card.

296
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah.

297
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
He already thought

298
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
the boss wanted to kill him.

299
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,120
So whether he heard what happened afterward

300
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,040
is very important.

301
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
And about the second floor, rosemary,

302
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,120
yes, that's important too.

303
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,280
Right, it is.

304
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,080
That's the plan, man.

305
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,000
The plan, that's right.

306
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,720
That's right, sorry.

307
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,000
I got sidetracked, sorry.

308
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,240
I never would have thought.

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
I thought I was the male lead.

310
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
You're just the second male lead.

311
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,280
I thought

312
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Fine, I'll reluctantly let you be a co-lead.

313
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
But you're way too innocent.

314
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
Both of you have some issues.

315
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,600
We're the same, okay?

316
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,240
You think yours isn't innocent?

317
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,640
That's right.

318
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
Let me tell you today,

319
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,680
if you two try to figure out who will criticize me,

320
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
it will definitely be X.

321
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Why?

322
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Today, you two

323
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,600
because my "sins" are too great.

324
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,520
Today, whichever one of you criticizes him,

325
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
I'll join in and criticize him too.

326
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,000
He's reacting like this again.

327
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,160
He just lost the lead role, it's fine.

328
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,160
I said it's a dual male lead.

329
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,280
That has nothing to do with it.

330
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,360
Dual male leads, okay?

331
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
Dual male leads.

332
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,520
You take the first lead, I'll be the second.

333
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,480
You and I, we're both male leads.

334
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Even though you have a bit less screen time.

335
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
Your scenes aren't as good as mine.

336
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
Your character isn't as strong or compelling as mine.

337
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,360
You're just a pitiful person.

338
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,960
You're just a pitiful person.

339
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
But I'm the kind who brings...

340
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,400
You're a pitiful person.

341
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360
No, you can't be the male lead.

342
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,000
Villains aren't allowed to be the lead.

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,040
So let him have the first lead.

344
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
I'll be the second lead, I'll play the villain lead.

345
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,800
Is that okay?

346
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,000
Villain male lead.

347
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Villain lead.

348
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
But I also want to play the villain.

349
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,800
How do you know I won't do it in a bit?

350
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,880
There are still some things left.

351
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,600
Alright.

352
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
Stop trying to make your character more interesting.

353
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,800
That's enough.

354
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,120
This part is enough, we're done acting.

355
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
Now it's their turn to act.

356
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,960
You're destined to be the second male lead.

357
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,640
What time is it now?

358
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Two thirty.

359
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
It's only two thirty?

360
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah.

361
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,440
Is it two thirty in the morning?

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Why does it feel like so much time has passed?

363
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
My beard has even grown out, hasn't it?

364
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,480
Let me tell you.

365
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm observing Lao Bai's state today.

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
Lao Bai is extremely relaxed today.

367
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
Him being so relaxed means that

368
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,080
he actually doesn't have a role.

369
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,640
I have a role.

370
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
You're just a supporting character.

371
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,320
Stop doing that.

372
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
So relaxed.

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you think he was tense yesterday?

374
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,760
He was a bit tense yesterday.

375
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
But today he's extremely relaxed.

376
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
That means he can just mess around.

377
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Do you get that feeling?

378
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,360
I don't think he's that relaxed.

379
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,320
What gives you the right to—

380
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm going to protect you today.

381
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,880
Come on, what role do you have to protect me?

382
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
What role?

383
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,680
The killer is very smart.

384
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
I think they're a lot like me.

385
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,680
There are many similarities.

386
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Stop comparing yourself to them.

387
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,240
That's enough.

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,720
Your character arc ends here.

389
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,040
If I add a bit more, maybe I can...

390
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
You're destined to be the second lead.

391
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
We just went to look at the rope in the middle.

392
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,400
We didn't check which rope was missing.

393
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,640
What do you mean?

394
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
I mean when we untied the rope.

395
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
It must have been thrown back where it was.

396
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
Check whose spot it is.

397
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
If a rope is missing,

398
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,800
they would have put it there for you.

399
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,280
That person is the culprit.

400
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
Be honest.

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
Since you brought this up, I think

402
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm the culprit now.

403
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,440
What if this is key evidence?

404
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,360
If that's the case,

405
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,600
let's go check it out together.

406
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,080
I've already messed it up.

407
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
You messed it up and now you're saying this?

408
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
What do you mean?

409
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,480
What does he mean?

410
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Something's off about you.

411
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,400
But just now, I was thinking about that culprit.

412
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,440
What exactly was he feeling?

413
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,200
As he led us along, step by step.

414
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,760
Was he trying to be as clever as usual,

415
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,400
and notice certain clues,

416
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,760
or did noticing these clues

417
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
make it all seem too deliberate,

418
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,800
and end up exposing himself?

419
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
She’s firing at us.

420
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
I think she’s right to do so.

421
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,520
It’s the right move.

422
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,360
I think her firing like this

423
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,920
is completely fine.

424
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,880
What are you doubting?

425
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,400
She’s helping her own culprit.

426
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,200
What do you mean?

427
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
You mean you’ve identified her as X?

428
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,200
But it really is.

429
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,120
That remote control.

430
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,520
Yesterday, it didn't have any batteries.

431
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
But today, it has power.

432
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
Who is the one playing with electricity?

433
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
If we're talking about playing with electricity,

434
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
who among us is an expert?

435
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,560
Pair.

436
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,440
Electricity.

437
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,520
Room.

438
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,720
Okay.

439
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,960
This battery model is very special.

440
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,520
It's not a model that ordinary people can buy.

441
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,240
I think that electricity—

442
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,920
And also,

443
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,440
Only you have the means to electrocute someone.

444
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,080
What's it called?

445
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,240
And hanging, too.

446
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
It meets the requirements for both the wire and the electricity.

447
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,040
Right.

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Both the electricity and the wire are accounted for.

449
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Plus, you knew he was going to find you.

450
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,640
That adds another layer of suspicion.

451
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
It's just that this thing exists.

452
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,040
Otherwise, its existence would be meaningless.

453
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,360
Who do you think is the murderer?

454
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,400
In my mind, you two are the biggest suspects.

455
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
So at the beginning,

456
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
I thought his motive was the strongest.

457
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,960
Even in the game just now,

458
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
he was the first to escape.

459
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,680
He might have had

460
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,760
some kind of authority or something like that.

461
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,680
But

462
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,680
his reason is just too weak.

463
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,840
In my opinion,

464
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
my motive is too weak.

465
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
Your motive for murder is too weak.

466
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
It's just too strange.

467
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,280
Because the two of us have very detailed stories,

468
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
but you two explained things very simply.

469
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,400
If you consider the motive for murder,

470
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,360
how would you rank the four of us?

471
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,840
I'm still thinking, wait a moment.

472
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,040
First, just now,

473
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,520
you thought I was more suspicious.

474
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,480
Right?

475
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Yes, if you rank it like this, it can only be

476
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,000
you think I'm more suspicious.

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Come on, tell us about yourself.

478
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
Who do you think is more suspicious?

479
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,599
I don't know.

480
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,040
I have no clue right now.

481
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,720
Alright.

482
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,680
Bai Hanzi, who do you suspect the most?

483
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,359
The person I suspect the most so far

484
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,160
might be him.

485
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,720
It's He.

486
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,599
At first, I suspected him more.

487
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,240
But now,

488
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
I might suspect him even more.

489
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,240
Okay.

490
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,720
Who do you suspect the most right now?

491
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,360
Him.

492
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,640
Because his key is still there.

493
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
Because of that conveyor belt.

494
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,640
You have to go through there to leave.

495
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,960
So I think

496
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,880
I suspect him a little.

497
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
It's because his key was left there.

498
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Alright, let's get ready to vote.

499
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
This vote goes to

500
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,160
Heniba.

501
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,000
I think it's only him.

502
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Bai Huanzi.

503
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
The suspect is

504
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Heniba.

505
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
The person I think is the culprit is

506
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Bai Huanzi.

507
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,440
The chosen suspect is

508
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,040
Bai Huanzi.

509
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,680
I choose

510
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,280
Heniba.

511
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,000
It really was me.

512
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,440
No.

513
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
It was just a simple personal grudge that made me the choice.

514
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
It's not a personal grudge.

515
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
How can this be called a personal grudge?

516
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,160
Okay.

517
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,680
It's just a small hunch.

518
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,280
Okay.

519
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,920
I really don't want to be the "fool."

520
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
I won't stand in the middle, you guys stand in the middle.

521
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,600
The two of us will stand in the middle.

522
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll stand in the middle.

523
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,560
Okay.

524
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,520
I really don't want to be the "fool."

525
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm really speechless, seriously.

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,560
It doesn't matter.

527
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,880
If you play the "fool" a few more times, you'll get used to it.

528
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,120
She's definitely not X.

529
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,440
She—she's not in the X state.

530
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
If you turn out to be X today, I'll accept it.

531
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,280
So, what is she like when she's X?

532
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
Have you ever been X on the show?

533
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I've never been, I've never been X.

534
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,840
You've never been?

535
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,200
So today is my first time

536
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,920
first time being X

537
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,000
Alright, stop sighing here

538
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,040
Seriously

539
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,680
I lost

540
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,840
Can't I even sigh after losing?

541
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
There's no way this person is bold enough not to choose X, right?

542
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,040
He would, he could totally do something like that

543
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,600
Really?

544
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,240
Really

545
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
The real culprit is

546
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,560
Bai Hanzi

547
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,400
Is there an X this round?

548
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
Come on, you really...

549
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
No, that's not it

550
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,080
Ba Jie

551
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,600
You two are really teaming up today

552
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,960
I just wanted everyone to think it was impossible

553
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,800
No one guessed in that direction at all

554
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,160
Just playing a little trick

555
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,480
How should I put it?

556
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,120
I think

557
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
it should go to me.

558
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,560
Because it seems like in this story,

559
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm the worst boss.

560
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
But actually,

561
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
in our whole detective group,

562
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm the kindest person.

563
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm especially willing to trust everyone.

564
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I offered some very constructive suggestions.

565
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
A role in this team

566
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,400
helped the team solve the case quickly.

567
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,720
That was thanks to me.

568
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
So the MVP for this round

569
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,640
I don't care if anyone is better than me,

570
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm going to give it to myself.

571
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Give myself a big encouragement.

572
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,400
Is that okay?

573
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm voting for myself.

574
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,080
I accurately voted for

575
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,960
the culprit.

576
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,040
That's a rare achievement.

577
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
Just kidding.

578
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,800
Actually, this round

579
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
I think Bai did really well.

580
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
Even though he was the culprit,

581
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
he really

582
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
made me hesitate at the end.

583
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,440
Yes, his attitude, that relaxed vibe,

584
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,760
if I were the culprit,

585
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
I couldn't pull that off.

586
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,240
I think the MVP this round

587
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,560
is Liu Yuning.

588
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,680
Because I really

589
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,440
feel sorry for him.

590
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
I think I'm the "fool,"

591
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,480
but I think players like him

592
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,720
only with his presence

593
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
does this game become more interesting.

594
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,600
Anyway, I really think he played very seriously.

595
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
And his reasoning was actually very logical.

596
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
You were the one who voted correctly in the end.

597
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,160
Yes.

598
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,240
Actually, this game often turns out like this.

599
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
The more seriously you play,

600
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,960
or if you have your own set of logic,

601
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,040
the more conflicted you get at the end.

602
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
Because I felt like I voted correctly.

603
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
It's not that I'm especially skilled.

604
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,640
It was just that I was a bit luckier.

605
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,160
Yeah.

606
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,720
Who do you think is this round's

607
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
MVP?

608
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,160
It should be the winner, the one who voted correctly.

609
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
I vote for

610
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,960
Golden Spoon.

611
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,960
Because she was clear-headed

612
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,160
and stuck to her own choices,

613
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,720
she was able to identify the real culprit in the end.

614
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,280
She led everyone to victory.

615
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,920
She was impressive.

616
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
The MVP of this case

617
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
should be Bai.

618
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Because

619
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,440
I think this time, compared to last time,

620
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,840
when he was the culprit,

621
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,480
he was much more relaxed.

622
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,800
So even up until the end today,

623
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,040
before we locked in the culprit,

624
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
I still couldn't be sure

625
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,080
who the real culprit was.

626
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,640
I think today,

627
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,920
about fifty or sixty percent

628
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,080
was down to luck.

629
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,600
Even though he was the culprit,

630
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,280
he contributed a lot to the reasoning process.

631
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,560
He put in both brainpower and effort in every aspect.

632
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
So Bai is definitely

633
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,520
the well-deserved MVP.

634
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,040
Liu Yuning

635
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,680
is so cool.

636
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,320
He really protected me.

637
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,240
He will always be my good big brother.

638
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,760
I'll block him on WeChat as soon as I get back.
