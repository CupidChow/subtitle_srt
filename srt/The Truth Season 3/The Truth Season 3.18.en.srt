"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,480
An unknown fog shrouds the city of Tui.

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,400
Players will experience

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,920
In each investigation, six players will be divided into

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,360
detectives, suspects, and the real culprit.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,200
The real culprit's task is to hide their identity.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,880
and avoid being discovered by the other players.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,160
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,560
If the culprit passes a challenge,

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,800
they can choose one detective

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
to turn them into X.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Once blackened, X joins the culprit's team.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
During the subsequent investigation,

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
they work together to help the culprit escape.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
After the investigation, players vote for the real culprit.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,080
If the culprit receives fewer votes than the other suspects,

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
the culprit and X win the golden key.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Otherwise,

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
the players who voted correctly win the golden key.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,480
Bai Yu

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Dilraba

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,280
Jin Jing

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,000
Liu Yuning

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,840
Zhang Linghe

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,760
Zhou Keyu

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,840
Your mission

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,880
is to find an extremely dangerous person

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,120
and capture him.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,600
But you failed your mission the first time.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,800
I let you be reborn as

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
six workers at the Tui Sweets Factory

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
to investigate this place

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,280
and its connection to the mysterious person.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,880
However,

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,480
you failed once again.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
This time, I will send you

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,680
to be reborn at the Pirate Mansion.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
I hope that here

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
you can successfully find

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
clues about the mysterious person.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,640
Master

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Master, look! I've arrived at a place.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,200
This place is called Pirate Mansion.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,160
There are a lot of collections here.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,160
Master

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
I want you to take a look at these items.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Can you "open the door" for them?

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
Where are the items?

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,720
Show me.

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
I asked a friend I know

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,880
Ning Receptionist

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,040
Hello, Master.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,160
Master, this is Ning Receptionist here.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,720
Hello.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm the receptionist at Pirate Mansion.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
My name is Ning Receptionist.

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
Shangbao said you are her master.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,640
So we have a few items here

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Could you take a look for us?

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Sure, take them out and let me have a look.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,920
No problem.

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,480
Okay, Master, come take a look.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
This one really looks quite "authentic."

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
What is this?

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
Can I take a closer look at this?

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,200
Sure.

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Up close.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,000
Up close.

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,800
This is just an ordinary clothes hanger.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,800
But the patterns on it

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,920
Why does it look unusual to me?

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,720
It should be quite old.

73
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
The paint on it feels

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,280
I think this clothes hanger looks really nice.

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,880
Really.

76
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
It doesn't seem like an ordinary hanger.

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,720
Really?

78
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,000
It's beautiful. This hanger is really nice.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
I have to play you a victory tune.

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,400
Right?

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,040
In my opinion, this clothes hanger

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
is a very "auspicious" hanger.

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Really, Master?

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,600
Very "auspicious."

85
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,360
Extremely "auspicious."

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
So how much is this roughly worth?

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,720
Yeah, how much?

88
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
How much money?

89
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
If the item is genuine,

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
I can offer

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
two million.

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,480
Two million?

93
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Master.

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,320
Is that for real?

95
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
I can offer that amount.

96
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
Master.

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Can it be "passed on," Master?

98
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,280
Master, can it be "passed on"?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,680
To be honest,

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
this item can be "passed on."

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,800
But your mansion is very interesting.

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
Could you show me around?

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
Sorry, Master.

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,040
Because these past couple of days

105
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,720
our mansion has special events.

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,839
So it's not open to the public.

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,000
When we are open,

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,519
we'll invite you, okay?

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,320
That's such a pity.

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
Then next time,

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,040
be sure to invite me to take a look, alright?

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
Alright.

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,600
Let's see if there are any good items then.

114
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Be sure to let me know right away, okay?

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,600
Okay, goodbye, Master.

116
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,120
Alright.

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,480
Thank you, Master.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, goodbye.

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Goodbye.

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,840
Let me tell you,

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
this Pirate Mansion of ours

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
used to belong to a legendary female pirate

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
and was renovated from Madam Tui's ancestral home.

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
I know about Madam Tui.

125
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
She had an island,

126
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
and there were lots of treasures on it.

127
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,840
And then—

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
Don’t say what you shouldn’t.

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Right.

130
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,360
I won’t.

131
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
Sorry.

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
I’m the kind of person

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
who’s known for being brave.

134
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,440
But

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,200
here,

136
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
don’t look at what you shouldn’t.

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,800
And definitely don’t say what you shouldn’t.

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Come, follow me.

139
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,440
Let’s go.

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Today

141
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,040
Drizzle is falling, and there's fog

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,000
No matter how many difficulties I face

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I still have to raise my pet bug

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He the pet bug

145
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm the king of breakdancing

146
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
Ke, the wild dance king

147
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,600
How about it?

148
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
Don't

149
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
Don't be afraid, give it a try

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
No, I'm really scared of this

151
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,200
Just try it

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,560
This is my little pet

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
Pet it, come on

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,320
That's enough

155
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
Where's our friend?

156
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,640
Here they come

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,040
There are two handsome guys

158
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
Are you waiting for me?

159
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Your lover

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,080
I don't know her

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
I don't know her

162
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
If you want to know who I am

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm the most beautiful woman in the world

164
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
My name is Jin Shangbao

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Everyone says I'm great

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,000
Who are you?

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm a guest here

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm the most beautiful woman in the world

169
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Respond

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,680
Respond

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know how to respond

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,680
To enter this door, you have to pet it first

173
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
I don't want to touch it

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
I can pet you

175
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
No, you have to pet it

176
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,000
That's the rule

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Can I pet him instead?

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
No, it has to be this one

179
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Just touch its back, it's fine

180
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
So scary, it's alive.

181
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,680
No.

182
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
It won't bite.

183
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,840
Here comes another one.

184
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,240
Now this is the most beautiful woman in the world.

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,280
So beautiful, so fragrant.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
Hello everyone, my name is Ba Jiaoshan.

187
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm twenty-three years old.

188
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm a folk singer.

189
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm very proud and also very kind.

190
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Now this is the most beautiful woman in the world.

191
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
I admit it.

192
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,880
Hello everyone.

193
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,960
Hello.

194
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,440
It's true.

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,880
It's true.

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,360
Yes.

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
Pet it.

198
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
You're so brave.

199
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,159
Look at the others.

200
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Hello everyone, my name is

201
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Ba Jiaoshan.

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
Hurry up, introduce yourself.

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm

204
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm Jin Shangbao.

205
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
Because I'm too beautiful,

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
I've threatened Ba Jiaoshan's status.

207
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Now she's holding me at gunpoint.

208
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Did the two of us not introduce ourselves?

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
It seems we really didn't.

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,960
What's your name?

211
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,640
My name is

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,880
My name is

213
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,560
It's a bit embarrassing.

214
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,640
It's a bit embarrassed.

215
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
They're asking you.

216
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,600
They're asking you.

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,560
Here comes another one.

218
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Hello, handsome.

219
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Brother.

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,240
I draw on white paper, then on black paper.

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,520
After drawing on black paper, I draw on white paper.

222
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
White paper drawing.

223
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Good night, young master.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Good morning, young lady.

225
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
I am Ning, the receptionist here.

226
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,040
This gentleman here,

227
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,520
is an older brother of Handsome, right?

228
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:36,880
That's right.

229
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay.

230
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
Come on, sir, stand here.

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
You want me to stand in the center, right?

232
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Yes.

233
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,120
Say who you are.

234
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,480
Say who you are.

235
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,000
You think you're the only one who has it?

236
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Put the "gun" down.

237
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
Are there some people without invitations?

238
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,520
I have an invitation.

239
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
I have an invitation too.

240
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
Hello, lucky guest.

241
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,200
I am "Classic Eternal Ship".

242
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
The host of Pirate Mansion.

243
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,960
Pushing the new wave.

244
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,480
I finally found

245
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,760
the coordinates of Lady Tui's mysterious island.

246
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,280
So I planned an immersive exhibition.

247
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Among the guests who have visited the mansion,

248
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,560
I have chosen you.

249
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,040
Join me in revisiting Lady Tui's life.

250
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Event time:

251
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
Afternoon of March 13th.

252
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,320
Check in at Pirate Mansion.

253
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,520
6 PM on March 13th.

254
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,360
Go to the Pirate Mansion lounge.

255
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,080
Enjoy specialty food and drinks.

256
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
6 AM on March 14th.

257
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,880
The immersive exhibition officially begins.

258
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,480
Pushing the new wave.

259
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,560
Invitation sent on March 11th.

260
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,240
It just rang.

261
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
I am Tui Houlang

262
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,280
the manager of this mansion.

263
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
I believe everyone already knows me.

264
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,200
That's right.

265
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,040
Alright.

266
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,480
Here I have a precious portrait of my ancestor,

267
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
left behind by Tui Sanniang.

268
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
Let me take a look

269
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
and see if your outfits resemble those from back then.

270
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,600
Back then.

271
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,560
They do.

272
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,040
That's fine.

273
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
Do we look like people from back then?

274
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,600
What do we have to do with back then?

275
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,080
It's like when we film period dramas,

276
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
you have to wear period costumes,

277
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
just like people did in the past.

278
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,440
That's right.

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Alright.

280
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Let's appreciate the treasure.

281
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,480
What do you think

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,080
about the outfits of the four guys today?

283
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Do you have any thoughts?

284
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,760
Do they have to act so coy?

285
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,400
I almost tripped myself.

286
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
But actually, today I

287
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,800
like Bajiaoshan's eyes even more.

288
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,680
Your eyes are really beautiful.

289
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,280
How am I supposed to talk to you like this?

290
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,800
No.

291
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,360
Look into my eyes.

292
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,240
In real life, can anyone talk to you normally?

293
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Of course.

294
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,960
Of course.

295
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,480
What do you mean?

296
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,920
Looking at your face makes me lose myself.

297
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
What are you talking about?

298
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,160
In real life,

299
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,200
is there anyone who talks to you without getting distracted?

300
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,040
No.

301
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,000
No.

302
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
What's this?

303
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
The four of us gentlemen

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,280
If it's about the four gentlemen,

305
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,560
there's nothing special.

306
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,000
I think

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,640
I want them to try harder.

308
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,280
I want to ask

309
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,720
how did you choose us?

310
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
Because you're handsome.

311
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,720
Is Jin Shangbao the same?

312
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes.

313
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,960
Handsome.

314
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
Can I borrow the gun for a moment?

315
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
I want to "kill someone."

316
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
It's about time.

317
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,280
The "San Niang's Treasure" immersive exhibition

318
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,920
will showcase San Niang's entire life

319
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,080
condensed into these three exhibitions.

320
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,160
These three exhibitions are respectively

321
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,760
After the immersive experience of the three exhibitions ends,

322
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,720
everyone can board

323
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,800
the boat to the mysterious island.

324
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,160
On the mysterious island,

325
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,760
the treasure left by Tui San Niang is hidden.

326
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
I believe everyone can

327
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,640
find what they want on the island.

328
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Alright.

329
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,880
I must remind everyone

330
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,280
that once the immersive exhibition begins, it cannot be stopped.

331
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,400
Every time the bell rings,

332
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
the corresponding exhibition must be started.

333
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
Otherwise,

334
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,720
What do you mean?

335
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
You're trying to scare us.

336
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,680
The first bell has already rung just now.

337
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
So next is the first exhibition.

338
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
Guided by water.

339
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,400
Everyone, follow me.

340
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Slow down, watch your step.

341
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,440
Thank you.

342
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,880
This is so hot.

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,600
Wait a moment.

344
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Everyone will enter through this door

345
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,880
one at a time.

346
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,320
Fifteen minutes after the first person enters,

347
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,000
the second person can proceed.

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,040
Enter the small room with the light on

349
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,440
and do not make any noise.

350
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,000
One by one

351
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,480
What if I'm a little scared?

352
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,440
I'll go with him

353
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,160
Let me go with him

354
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Okay, no problem

355
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,040
So, you two will go together

356
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
The other four must act alone

357
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,880
No, I'll go with her

358
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
We can't be separated

359
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,040
Because we're "twin" sisters

360
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't believe that

361
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,840
I don't believe it

362
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,800
My nose ring is about to fall off

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,280
You have a nose ring?

364
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
Cool, I just noticed

365
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,880
I've always looked at your left side

366
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
Why do you always look at my left side?

367
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
Because he's always standing on your left

368
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,400
The place closest to your heart

369
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Hurry up and go in, will you?

370
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,320
Go in quickly.

371
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,280
Then let's all six go in together.

372
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,520
Only those two can go in together.

373
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Why?

374
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,600
They asked first.

375
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
But there's one condition.

376
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,680
You two must be the last to enter.

377
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,320
Okay.

378
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
And after you go in,

379
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,640
you need to lock this wooden door from the inside.

380
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,760
To prevent anyone from escaping.

381
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,200
After the ceremony ends and the music stops,

382
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,160
I'll come to take everyone out.

383
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,760
It's exactly six o'clock now.

384
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,400
It's six o'clock.

385
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
The ceremony officially begins.

386
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
The first person, please go in.

387
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,880
I'll go first.

388
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,360
First.

389
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ba Jiaoshan is second.

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,680
Ba Jiaoshan is second.

391
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Then I'll be third.

392
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay.

393
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,520
Ning Jiedai is fourth.

394
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,720
The two of us are last.

395
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,920
First.

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,360
Fill a bucket with spring water in the exhibition hall.

397
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,600
Pour it into the wishing box.

398
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,040
How do I collect it?

399
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,200
The water is flowing.

400
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,840
This is how you collect the water.

401
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay.

402
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
Listen to the sounds inside.

403
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,200
He definitely won't let you

404
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,280
carry the water over so easily.

405
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,400
There must be something inside.

406
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,079
Yeah.

407
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,599
My heart is pounding like crazy.

408
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,880
Who are you?

409
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Who are you?

410
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,920
Stop!

411
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
I am a proud pirate.

412
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
I've sailed the seas for so many years.

413
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,400
I've seen plenty of strange things.

414
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
I'll go second.

415
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,400
Bye, good luck!

416
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,800
It's pitch black, man.

417
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,960
So scary.

418
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,480
No, there's not a single light.

419
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,280
The water's here.

420
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,240
Who is this?

421
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,600
How can someone be so mean?

422
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
You broke my bucket.

423
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
The water's here.

424
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Who is this?

425
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,920
How can someone be so mean?

426
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,440
You broke my bucket.

427
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,280
What are you?

428
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,440
Can you move aside?

429
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,720
Why would I move? What are you?

430
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,680
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

431
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
Go after whoever killed you.

432
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,160
Wait a second.

433
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
I heard Ba Jiaoshan scream.

434
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Her scream is so loud.

435
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
Looks like this really is scary.

436
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,440
Good thing it's just us, bro.

437
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,680
Otherwise, it would be bad.

438
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,680
Can you be any more cowardly?

439
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,720
Go after whoever killed you.

440
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,200
Don't touch me.

441
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,600
What did I do?

442
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,240
Why, may I ask?

443
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
Move aside.

444
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Don't get in the way while I pour water.

445
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,480
Go.

446
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,680
Is there anything you want to say to me?

447
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,880
Go, hurry up and go.

448
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
Stop dawdling.

449
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,240
Take the gun again.

450
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,800
You can do it!

451
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,640
You bravely made it through.

452
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
You'll get a kiss from both princes.

453
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm coming.

454
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,760
No, it's too dark.

455
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm about to cry.

456
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Where should I go?

457
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,280
You bravely made it through.

458
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
You'll get a kiss from both princes.

459
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
What was that sound?

460
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,760
That's too many to handle.

461
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,680
Who is it?

462
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,040
Come.

463
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,040
Kill me.

464
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll fight you with everything I've got.

465
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
Why does she look so happy?

466
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, she seems really excited.

467
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,160
Don't scare me.

468
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
In the darkness,

469
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,680
I wrote an original song.

470
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,400
What should I do in a bit?

471
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,360
You can do it, bro.

472
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
I feel like when you're on your own,

473
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,040
you just know

474
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,800
that you have to stand tall by yourself.

475
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,280
You just

476
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,600
suddenly feel a bit braver.

477
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,320
Yeah.

478
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Why is it so dark?

479
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,440
This won't do.

480
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,680
I'm not really good at this.

481
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,200
There's water over there.

482
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,560
Don't come over, I'll splash you.

483
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Let's go.

484
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
Let's go in and see what's going on.

485
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,520
Are you ready?

486
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
No need to prepare.

487
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,600
Lock the door.

488
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,560
After you go in,

489
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,760
be sure to lock this wooden door.

490
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,360
Okay.

491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,720
I'm a little scared.

492
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
It's okay, bro. I'm here.

493
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,240
You're not scared?

494
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm not scared.

495
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,960
Are you sure?

496
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm not scared.

497
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,920
Hold on to me.

498
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,960
It's so wet.

499
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,520
I feel like a "blind person."

500
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,480
There's someone behind you.

501
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,000
Wait a second.

502
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,560
That scared me to death.

503
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Is there a platform here?

504
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
There's a platform.

505
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,320
There's someone behind you.

506
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,120
Wishing box.

507
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Pour it in through this hole.

508
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
Pour it.

509
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,360
Okay.

510
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,400
The light is on.

511
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,560
Please close the door properly.

512
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,240
No talking.

513
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,880
It's over.

514
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,920
What do you mean?

515
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,760
After everyone's ceremony is finished,

516
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,720
the music will stop.

517
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
Then I'll come to take everyone away.

518
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
Tuihoulang said when the music stops,

519
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,160
he'll come to find us.

520
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,720
Where is he?

521
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
Tuihoulang.

522
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,520
Open the door.

523
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,760
Is anyone there?

524
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,920
No one's coming to get us.

525
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,600
Where is everyone?

526
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
Kick it.

527
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,720
Let me do it.

528
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,320
Nice kick.

529
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Save him, bro.

530
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
Save our brother.

531
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,080
Save our brother later, save the girl first.

532
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,080
Save the lady, hurry!

533
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,360
Pet bug.

534
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,440
Give it a kick.

535
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
I can't even move it with a kick.

536
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,400
Old Bai.

537
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Come out.

538
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,640
I've been inside for an hour.

539
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,240
I feel...

540
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,640
What's wrong?

541
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,040
What's this?

542
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,120
What is this?

543
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
This shoe...

544
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,440
Isn't this your boss's shoe?

545
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Yeah.

546
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
Tuihoulang died in here.

547
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
He died in here.

548
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,080
And judging by his position,

549
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,200
he must have drowned.

550
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,200
This can be lifted.

551
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,200
Come on, pull him out.

552
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,200
Come on.

553
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,560
Three, two, one, lift.

554
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:18,960
Come on.

555
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,640
Pull it over directly.

556
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,080
Let's take a look at him first.

557
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,000
Check the body first.

558
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,840
Is anyone there?

559
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,920
Did someone knock on the door?

560
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,880
Coming.

561
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
What happened inside?

562
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
Boss.

563
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
The boss is dead.

564
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,280
It's only my first day at work.

565
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,480
How did the boss die?

566
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
You will definitely find out

567
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,760
the truth behind the boss's death, right?

568
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,080
That's right.

569
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't worry.

570
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,560

An evidence-searching assistant tool.

574
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,480
We hope it can help everyone

575
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,640
organize information and clues,

576
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,960
clarify the logical threads,

577
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,280
and explore the truth at every moment.

578
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,640
Let's set off together with Tongcheng.

579
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay.

580
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,240
Thank you.

581
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,640
Thank you.

582
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,080
Thank you.

583
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

584
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,320
Case Three officially begins.

585
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,320
It is now March 14, 2025.

586
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,800
7:30.

587
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
The victim in this case is Tui Houlang.

588
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,120
After a preliminary investigation,

589
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,400
the suspect who killed him has been narrowed down to

590
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,320
Ning Jiedai.

591
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,280
Blank Paper Drawing

592
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,080
Ba Jiaoshan

593
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Among the four of Jin Shangbao

594
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,720
He Chongchong and Ke Wuwang

595
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,160
were together the whole time

596
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
and had no time to commit the crime

597
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,040
so they can be completely ruled out as suspects

598
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,960
You are the detectives for this case

599
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
Now, after the detectives question the suspects

600
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,880
please lead the suspects to start collecting evidence

601
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,440
The time of the incident is

602
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,400
7:30 on March 14th

603
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,360
Everyone, between 5:30 and 6:00

604
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
was still with Detective Houlang

605
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
After everyone

606
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,320
finished attending the exhibition

607
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
we opened the door and found the body

608
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
It was around 7:30

609
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,040
So the time of death

610
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,000
was between 6:00 and 7:30

611
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
Next, please introduce

612
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,280
your relationship with the deceased

613
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,200
He is my boss

614
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
He is your boss

615
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
Weren't you here to have fun too?

616
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,560
I sing at the club

617
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
I'm a folk singer

618
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,600
Sing a few lines for me

619
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,440
How authentic

620
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,040
How long have you been working here?

621
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
Is it your place to ask?

622
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,840
Today's investigation

623
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
What do you do?

624
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
He's the younger brother.

625
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,000
You've gone a bit too far today.

626
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,200
Sorry.

627
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,920
Stand up.

628
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,760
Hold him down.

629
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,760
You.

630
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,520
And you?

631
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,960
Could you be any more pathetic?

632
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,360
I have nothing to do with him.

633
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,400
I don't know him.

634
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,560
I don't know him.

635
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Are you sure?

636
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,280
Absolutely no connection?

637
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,400
None at all.

638
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,120
Well, if you have to say there's a connection,

639
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,160
there is a little.

640
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,280
I was also invited here.

641
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm not familiar with him at all.

642
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,400
Then why did he invite you?

643
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,520
None of your business.

644
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Why did you come then?

645
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,280
He invited me.

646
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,760
If you have nothing to do with him, why did you come?

647
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,160
I've visited this place before.

648
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,200
One day, he suddenly sent me an invitation.

649
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,840
He said he was inviting me to this party.

650
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,000
So I came.

651
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,520
I've been here before.

652
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,840
Why did you come before?

653
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
There was an exhibition before.

654
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,200
To see the exhibition.

655
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,840
Yeah.

656
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,240
I also came here before to see the exhibition.

657
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,120
Then he invited me to come over.

658
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,120
My job is assistant broadcaster.

659
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,640
We have a live streaming event.

660
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,400
The theme is the same as here.

661
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
We came here to hold it.

662
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,480
So you know the boss too?

663
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,000
No, I don't.

664
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm naturally from here.

665
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,560
An employee.

666
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,440
Receptionist Ning.

667
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,800
So I've always worked here.

668
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,360
With your boss,

669
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,840
there's no financial connection.

670
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,360
Of course there is.

671
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,840
He pays my salary.

672
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,560
Let's collect evidence first.

673
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,840
Let's collect evidence first.

674
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,360
Start by searching the body.

675
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,720
Nothing. There are no other traces.

676
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,800
You can take off your shoes.

677
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,920
There's nothing on the body.

678
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,800
What about the area nearby?

679
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,160
Is there anything else in the water?

680
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
Check the pool.

681
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,760
Broken glass.

682
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,200
A lot of broken glass.

683
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,800
Must be a mirror.

684
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,600
A mirror.

685
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,800
Why is there a mirror?

686
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
Why is there a mirror?

687
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,800
Drowned.

688
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
A lot of broken glass.

689
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,320
Must be a mirror.

690
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
There's a method of committing a crime.

691
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,440
It involves placing a mirror at an angle.

692
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,680
Trapping someone behind the mirror.

693
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
What we actually see inside

694
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
is a complete water tank.

695
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,760
From the outside, looking in,

696
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,560
you can't see it.

697
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Then he broke it from inside.

698
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,880
Right.

699
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,960
So we added this water.

700
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,840
So anyone could have done it.

701
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,240
Including you.

702
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm fine. It was me.

703
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,840
Let's search the crime scene first.

704
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,680
What is this thing?

705
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,360
What is this?

706
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,720
You'll know once you open it.

707
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
Powerful sleep-inducing mist

708
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,040
For people with insomnia

709
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Inhaling it will cause immediate unconsciousness.

710
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,720
This is the person from earlier.

711
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
The person from before.

712
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,680
He was knocked out.

713
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Knocked out.

714
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,840
There's a mirror here.

715
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Isn't this that mirror?

716
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,800
The mirror inside there.

717
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,960
Be careful.

718
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
Instructions

719
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,560
The mirror is made of very fragile material.

720
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,000
When a nearby sound

721
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,640
exceeds 130 decibels for one minute,

722
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
the product will shatter.

723
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,840
Handle with care.

724
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,560
For one minute.

725
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,960
No.

726
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,120
It could be

727
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,000
that this guy shouted himself.

728
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,040
He shouted in the water.

729
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
Then why did it break?

730
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,679
Found a phonograph.

731
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,159
Just found a phonograph here.

732
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,600
He set it to 150 decibels.

733
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,440
So it must have been some kind of timer device.

734
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,239
So it only went off at the end.

735
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,080
Right.

736
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Set to be very loud.

737
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,400
Right.

738
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,679
After all of us went in,

739
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,199
Let's go over how he

740
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,080
killed this person.

741
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,639
First,

742
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,800
he must have knocked out the boss after the exhibition started.

743
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,280
He knocked the boss unconscious.

744
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,000
Right.

745
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,679
Put him inside.

746
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,280
After putting him in, he blocked him with glass.

747
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,159
Then he set up the decibel speaker.

748
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,000
Then he put on this costume himself.

749
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,560
And started to scare people.

750
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,200
But it could have been the first person,

751
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,600
or the second,

752
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,760
or maybe the third or fourth person.

753
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
After seeing the two of us go in,

754
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,120
he played this recording.

755
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,800
As soon as the mirror shattered,

756
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,440
he crawled in himself.

757
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
The exhibition ended.

758
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
We broke through the door and saw this.

759
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,440
That's what it means.

760
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,840
I want to ask,

761
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,440
how did the victim get in?

762
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,440
After you entered,

763
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,600
you must have locked this wooden door from the inside.

764
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,400
How did the victim get in?

765
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,800
Besides that door,

766
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
there's another one,

767
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
a door that leads here.

768
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,040
Let's take a look.

769
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,760
Let's see if there's

770
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
a hidden door or something.

771
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,480
A hidden door.

772
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,920
Here's his coat.

773
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,400
Could this cabinet be...

774
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,480
Come on, guys.

775
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
Let's go.

776
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Time to leave.

777
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,600
Yeah, let's go.

778
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,640
Then let's go first

779
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,520
and take a look at the boss's office.

780
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll take you there.

781
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,760
Okay.

782
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,120
This is my reception area.

783
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,600
The boss's study is right across.

784
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,200
The boss's study.

785
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,840
It's locked.

786
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,640
I'll get the key to the study.

787
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,760
Come on.

788
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,640
Can't this be opened?

789
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,120
It can't be opened.

790
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,520
It won't open.

791
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,560
Fruit.

792
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Go ahead, you eat it.

793
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll taste it to see if it's poisoned.

794
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
Let's go collect evidence.

795
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,600
Alright.

796
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,760
There are two locks here.

797
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,440
One is four digits, one is three digits.

798
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,520
What's the password?

799
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
It can't be opened.

800
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,760
It won't open.

801
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,000
What's this?

802
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,880
Come and see.

803
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,120
This is the new packaging for Coca-Cola.

804
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,760
Share bottle.

805
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Role-play with character combinations.

806
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,280
Scan the code with AI for verification.

807
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,520
Then you can get the password.

808
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,280
Which one do you think you are?

809
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm definitely the mood-setter.

810
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,720
What about you?

811
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,680
I'm definitely an introvert.

812
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,960
Alright, then I have to pick the social butterfly, right?

813
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
Okay, so all three of us have taken this.

814
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
It suits you so well.

815
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,520
One

816
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Two

817
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,200
Three

818
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,920
Four

819
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Five

820
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,720
Six

821
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,400
Seven

822
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,720
Eight

823
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,800
One

824
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,880
Two

825
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,960
Three

826
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Four

827
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,040
Five

828
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,680
Wait a moment.

829
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
Let's see if we can pass.

830
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,560
Everyone is holding their breath.

831
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,840
Tell me the password.

832
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,880
Mission accomplished.

833
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,640
The password is

834
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,360
"Coca-Cola" sharing bottle

835
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,240
The three of us are really smart.

836
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,800
Aren't we?

837
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,080
Yeah.

838
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,280
We could only solve it thanks to us.

839
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,880
Come on.

840
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,560
Let's drink up.

841
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,760
Refreshing.

842
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,640
Detective Agency Commissioned Investigation Report

843
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,680
Ba Jiaoshan, twenty-three years old.

844
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,640
No parents.

845
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,920
Jin Shangbao

846
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
No living relatives.

847
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
No close relationships.

848
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,760
Ning Jiedai

849
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,840
Baizhihua

850
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,440
Ke Wuwang

851
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,160
No close relationships.

852
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
Why is it the six of us?

853
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,280
Because we have no family.

854
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
Even if we go missing,

855
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,920
no one would worry about us.

856
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,800
No one would care if we died.

857
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,640
That's why he chose us.

858
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,320
That's right.

859
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
We need to search carefully.

860
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,960
Khoomei

861
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,800
Here it is.

862
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,800
Shredded paper.

863
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
A few people have left messages in the guestbook.

864
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,280
We've all been here.

865
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,560
Then we're all talking about the same thing.

866
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,520
Only we can go.

867
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,760
Help him finish something.

868
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,800
Right.

869
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,000
Okay.

870
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,280
Next, let's go see Ba Jiaoshan's room.

871
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
Alright.

872
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,520
Let's go.

873
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,640
Go in.

874
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,240
You just walk into a girl's room like this?

875
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
I'm a folk singer.

876
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm very proud and also very kind.

877
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,680
Wait, what's this?

878
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
Is this your stage costume?

879
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,600
A leopard-print grass skirt.

880
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,560
She's a singer.

881
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,040
It looks great.

882
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,760
I've been really into leopard print lately too.

883
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,320
What's this?

884
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,480
There's also a note.

885
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,080
There's a photo on it.

886
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,400
I sense a bit of gossip.

887
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,880
What gossip?

888
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,800
More gossip again?

889
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,560
It's really cold today.

890
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,680
We delivered blankets and hot soup to the elderly living alone.

891
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,640
We also fixed the drafty windows while we were at it.

892
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,560
If you were here, I wouldn't feel cold.

893
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Who is this?

894
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
There's another one.

895
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,640
Teaching blind Grandma Liu

896
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,000
to use her phone to send messages to her son.

897
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,400
If you were here—who are you, then?

898
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,000
He must be her lover.

899
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,400
That's so romantic.

900
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,720
But that sentence is so sad.

901
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,600
If you were here...

902
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,680
That means he's already gone.

903
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,560
He's already gone.

904
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
That's right.

905
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm twenty-three years old this year.

906
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,400
Six years ago, I woke up in a cave.

907
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,880
And in front of me

908
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,720
stood a very handsome young man.

909
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,920
He told me my name was Ba Jiaoshan.

910
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,480
Because the two of us went boating together.

911
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,080
Later, because of the waves,

912
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,720
my head hit a reef.

913
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,920
So I lost my memory.

914
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,160
That boy stayed with me the whole time.

915
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,080
He said we were lovers.

916
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,600
We went out on a boat trip together.

917
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,760
He said it, and you just believed him?

918
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,160
Because he told me my name.

919
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,000
So I trusted him a lot.

920
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You're so gullible.

921
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Anyone who found you could have told you that.

922
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,040
Is this what they call "pushing the younger generation"?

923
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,520
His name was Baba Liu.

924
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,440
It means "goodbye to you."

925
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,720
What's the big deal?

926
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
The captain's son pushes the new generation forward

927
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,640
Three months of salvage efforts yielded no results

928
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,040
Confirmed: January 1, 2020

929
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,400
No survivors in the "Dash" shipwreck incident

930
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,640
What?

931
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,960
Could it be that she has some connection to the people on the "Dash"?

932
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,920
Is there some kind of relationship?

933
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,320
This is a phone

934
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,240
The phone's photo album says

935
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,320
"Dash" Captain's Log

936
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,720
After calculations

937
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,040
The ship will completely sink thirty minutes after departure

938
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,760
Completely sunk, you heard that right.

939
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,320
It takes twenty minutes to deploy the lifeboats.

940
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,760
We have to move quickly.

941
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,400
That is, Captain "Dash".

942
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,800
He wants to sink this ship.

943
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,240
Yes.

944
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,640
But he plans to escape early.

945
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,240
On January 1st, 2020.

946
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,000
Baba Liu happily told me

947
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,720
that he found a ship

948
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,600
that could take us off this island.

949
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,440
This is the one.

950
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,320
We brought some dry food with us

951
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,000
and a star-shaped bottle.

952
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,560
We went to the storage room at the bottom of the ship.

953
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Then, on the ship,

954
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,720
there were always some really unpleasant noises.

955
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,680
I didn't know if those noises

956
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,920
were supposed to be there

957
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,600
or if something was wrong.

958
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,280
Because no one had any memories left?

959
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,680
Suddenly, a sharp sound appeared.

960
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,800
A scream.

961
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,360
It turned out the bottom of the ship was leaking.

962
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,680
The ship was going to sink.

963
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,440
Everyone on board panicked.

964
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,840
I saw a young girl.

965
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,760
She was very scared.

966
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,960
Then I noticed

967
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,440
there was a wooden box nearby.

968
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,160
Because she was so scared

969
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
and looked younger than me,

970
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,360
I thought, let her go out first.

971
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,280
Your story tells me

972
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,640
Your story tells me

973
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,240
how important it is to take care of yourself.

974
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,080
As long as you look a bit younger,

975
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,640
others will say,

976
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,400
"Save her, save her first!"

977
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,240
Yes.

978
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,400
Then I put her

979
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,240
into that box

980
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,960
and pushed her to the shore

981
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,680
I told her

982
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,720
Don't worry, you will definitely be rescued

983
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,400
At that moment

984
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,040
I was knocked out with a stick

985
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,080
I don't remember anything after that

986
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,360
When I woke up again

987
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,400
I was on the shore

988
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,880
And next to my hand

989
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,840
was that "Dash"

990
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,680
This

991
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,240
and this

992
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,960
and a message that said

993
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,320
Ba Jiaoshan, you have already been very kind

994
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,840
I can't bear

995
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,000
to see you risk your life to save others again

996
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,720
I want to give the only chance to survive

997
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,520
to you

998
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,920
When you get out

999
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,080
I hope you can see

1000
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,680
a world more beautiful than the cave

1001
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,400
Baba Liu

1002
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
He was the one who saved you

1003
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,160
Yes

1004
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,920
Outside Shandong

1005
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,320
When did you go to Shandong

1006
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,720
Cave

1007
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,720
Can you speak like a normal person?

1008
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,280
Your ears

1009
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,600
are no longer human ears.

1010
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,720
Shandong

1011
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,000
Cave

1012
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,040
Outside of Shandong

1013
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,160
There's also Shaanxi, and northern Shaanxi.

1014
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,720
Yes, three months later

1015
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,520
I saw this news in the newspaper.

1016
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,880
It was about the captain's son pushing the next generation.

1017
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,160
The news that the search after three months had failed.

1018
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,520
That's when I realized

1019
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,720
that Baba Liu had really left.

1020
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,960
Because the whole ship had already sunk.

1021
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,240
No one survived.

1022
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,960
My beloved

1023
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
I felt that he had left me forever.

1024
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,200
I felt I couldn't let him down.

1025
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,560
I had to live well.

1026
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,360
So every time, I would feel

1027
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,520
that I had to do many good deeds for him.

1028
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,000
After I did something good,

1029
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,840
I would write it down and put it in this message bottle.

1030
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,320
I would fold these notes into stars

1031
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,720
and put them inside, then throw it into the sea.

1032
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,280
He saved me.

1033
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,480
He let me go on living.

1034
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,560
So I want him to know

1035
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,440
the good things I've done.

1036
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,920
Has anyone ever folded stars for you?

1037
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:08,960
Has anyone?

1038
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,680
Of course.

1039
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,160
I've even folded them for others.

1040
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,120
Really? How old were you when you learned?

1041
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,920
At the age when I first started having feelings.

1042
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,840
How old was that?

1043
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,560
When did you first fall in love?

1044
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,600
So that means

1045
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,000
the ship you sank was the "Dash".

1046
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,600
Yes, the "Dash".

1047
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,040
That's right.

1048
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,480
Yes.

1049
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,960
Four years ago, in 2021,

1050
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,000
the "Classic Eternal Ship" opened.

1051
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,400
That's how it happened.

1052
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,880
The boss, Tu Houlang, found me.

1053
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,920
He wanted me to work there.

1054
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,360
Then, during my first performance,

1055
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,080
I was in his study

1056
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,120
and saw a poster about his family's rise.

1057
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,320
That's when I realized

1058
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,040
he was actually

1059
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,360
the son of the "Dash" captain.

1060
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,840
So you want to kill him

1061
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,040
to avenge your beloved.

1062
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,480
No

1063
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
I think we're both in the same boat

1064
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,480
No, I think she's right

1065
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,320
You feel like you have to live well for him

1066
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,680
But you think he should go be with his father

1067
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,600
So you killed him

1068
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,680
What kind of villain am I

1069
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,320
Ba Jiaoshan

1070
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
She isn't kind

1071
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,160
What is this

1072
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,320
This

1073
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,920
For the past month

1074
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,640
Actually, there's something else strange

1075
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,880
Every time after I finish performing

1076
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,920
When I go to the study to get his signature and collect my pay

1077
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,440
He always brings a strange bottle

1078
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,480
And goes into a room inside his study

1079
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,240
It's that "Elderly Treasure" thing

1080
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
But there are no elderly people in his house

1081
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,920
I found it very strange

1082
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,240
So yesterday

1083
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,040
After he signed for me and left

1084
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,840
I went around to the window and looked inside

1085
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,320
I didn't go in

1086
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,800
I saw the word on the notebook

1087
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,680
I saw the word on the notebook

1088
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,000
So I took a picture of it

1089
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,480
Turns out, pushing the next wave

1090
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,520
He knew back then that the ship was going to sink

1091
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,720
But he still let everyone board the ship

1092
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,080
He didn't tell anyone

1093
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,760
And he kept a backup plan for himself

1094
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,360
He could leave on a small boat

1095
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,120
Letting everyone else die on the ship

1096
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,760
And he kept bringing that medicine in

1097
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,240
I wonder if his father is still alive

1098
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,880
Okay, lock the suspect.

1099
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,600
Lock what?

1100
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,760
I didn't say he had to die.

1101
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,720
I think his father should die.

1102
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,600
Because his father knows about this.

1103
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,360
So his father has to die.

1104
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,080
So your motive for killing the rising star

1105
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,760
doesn't exist.

1106
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,920
No, I wanted to kill his father.

1107
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,320
His father caused her lover's death.

1108
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,760
Since she thinks his father is still alive,

1109
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,600
then I take your son...

1110
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,320
If I can't find your father,

1111
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,440
I'll kill your son first.

1112
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,680
So you can experience

1113
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,760
the pain of losing someone close to you.

1114
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Right.

1115
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,400
You clearly know a lot about criminal psychology.

1116
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,120
You've done this a lot, haven't you?

1117
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,640
That's right.

1118
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,520
Next, let's check Jin's room.

1119
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,600
Jin Shangbao.

1120
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,720
Come with me.

1121
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,200
Okay.

1122
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,280
Let's go.

1123
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,520
What's going on?

1124
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,080
This...

1125
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,000
You used to be...

1126
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,760
You used to be a pirate?

1127
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,200
Why do you have bread in your room?

1128
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,280
This kind of thing...

1129
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,880
This is the tastiest bread.

1130
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,760
Really?

1131
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,640
I don't believe it.

1132
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Let me try.

1133
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,200
I'll have a piece.

1134
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,560
This toast is pretty good.

1135
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,920
Yeah.

1136
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,600
This toast

1137
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,520
is pretty good.

1138
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,360
Really? I want some too.

1139
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,320
It's delicious.

1140
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,400
No, put some spread on it.

1141
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,960
Teacher, do you have any butter or strawberry jam?

1142
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,360
You're asking for too much.

1143
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,000
Let's search for it, everyone.

1144
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,240
What's this?

1145
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,080
There are a lot of fish accessories here.

1146
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,480
You aren't...

1147
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,880
a fan of Esther Yu, are you?

1148
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,400
Yes.

1149
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,200
Bro,

1150
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,640
how about watching her play with this?

1151
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,680
This one means I'm a fan of Zhang Linghe.

1152
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,720
Walnut.

1153
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,320
Right.

1154
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,200
I'm a fan of both Esther Yu and Zhang Linghe.

1155
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,920
Is there something inside this money?

1156
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,560
No, don't bother looking.

1157
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,000
That one's already been found.

1158
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,960
It's here.

1159
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,680
Notice of unnatural death.

1160
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,560
March 7, 2025, 18:00

1161
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,880
According to reports from Jietui City residents,

1162
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,960
in the offshore waters,

1163
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,880
a floating female body was found.

1164
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,800
After verification, the deceased was identified as Jin Saozhou.

1165
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,680
Female, 24 years old.

1166
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,280
Jin Saozhou must be your relative, right?

1167
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,160
Avenge your relative.

1168
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,560
No one is born an island.

1169
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,640
No one is born an island.

1170
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,240
No one is born an island.

1171
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,040
Who is born without close relationships?

1172
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,080
Everyone is raised by their parents.

1173
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,400
Raised by parents.

1174
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,000
I have not only my parents,

1175
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,960
but also an older sister.

1176
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,560
I had a happy family of four.

1177
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,520
Who

1178
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,720
killed my sister?

1179
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,760
One day, I suddenly received this.

1180
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,880
It said my sister had died.

1181
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,400
My sister died in the sea.

1182
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,120
This was very suspicious.

1183
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,560
Because when I was a child,

1184
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,000
I lived with my sister.

1185
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,080
But one day, my sister suddenly disappeared.

1186
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,360
My parents were already in poor health.

1187
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,040
My sister's disappearance

1188
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,520
was a heavy blow to them.

1189
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,160
They both passed away.

1190
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,680
That's when I became someone without close relationships.

1191
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,840
I hate it.

1192
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,160
I said, "Sister, please come back."

1193
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,160
My sister came back.

1194
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,800
Yes.

1195
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,560
Yes.

1196
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,880
But after my sister returned,

1197
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,320
something was very strange.

1198
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,800
She became extremely afraid of water.

1199
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,160
Just now, I heard Ba Jiaoshan's story.

1200
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,080
I think the timeline matches my sister's disappearance

1201
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,800
and her return.

1202
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,000
She might be your sister, right?

1203
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,360
She might have saved my sister.

1204
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,320
I saw a young girl.

1205
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,280
She was very scared.

1206
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,560
I put her in that box.

1207
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,640
I pushed her to the shore.

1208
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,400
I told her,

1209
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,440
"Don't worry, you will be rescued."

1210
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,280
That means it could be

1211
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
she saved your sister.

1212
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,280
After your sister was rescued,

1213
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,320
she became very afraid of water.

1214
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:55,720
Yes.

1215
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,840
The girl I risked my life to save

1216
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,080
ended up dying anyway.

1217
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,280
Yes.

1218
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,880
My sister died in the sea.

1219
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,360
This is very suspicious.

1220
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:04,800
Why is that?

1221
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,720
Because she would never go to the seaside again.

1222
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,640
I see, she was afraid of water.

1223
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,880
She worked at this place.

1224
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,600
She worked here.

1225
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:09,920
Yes.

1226
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,320
Alright.

1227
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
On the day she died,

1228
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,400
she was supposed to come here for work.

1229
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,120
Now I have to ask you.

1230
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,320
Last week,

1231
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
you were still messaging your sister.

1232
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,200
You said, "Sister, you're strong,"

1233
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,240
"so I'll trouble you today,"

1234
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,240
"to help me carry 150 jin of New Year's goods"

1235
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,880
"from the delivery station back home."

1236
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,360
I think I discovered a shocking secret.

1237
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,280
Then,

1238
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,920
Yes.

1239
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,480
She called her sister.

1240
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,360
You wanted to ask about the secret, right?

1241
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:34,760
Yes.

1242
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,440
But your sister

1243
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,920
never answered your calls again.

1244
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,880
And then immediately after, there was this...

1245
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,640
She died right away.

1246
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,280
So her death

1247
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,520
could not have been from natural causes.

1248
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,080
That's right.

1249
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,640
First, she would never go to the seaside.

1250
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,120
Second, she had a secret she wanted to tell me.

1251
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,040
Third, there's that button.

1252
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,800
It was on her, as one of her belongings.

1253
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,360
So I wondered who around her was connected to T.

1254
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,160
T, Te, Ta, Tui.

1255
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,880
Tui Houlang.

1256
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,520
So next,

1257
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,600
you went to Tui Houlang's office.

1258
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,840
And you took a photo of his coat.

1259
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,800
So your motive for killing him was

1260
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,760
suspicion.

1261
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,520
It wasn't suspicion.

1262
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,120
You just believed he killed your sister.

1263
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,600
Mainly, her finding that button was actually

1264
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,560
enough. Just that.

1265
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,360
It was enough, yes.

1266
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
Enough.

1267
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,560
If you convict me because of this,

1268
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,640
I won't love you anymore.

1269
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,520
You still haven't said where all your money came from.

1270
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,600
This...

1271
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,720
This is related to the money.

1272
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,080
Because my family owns a fish shop.

1273
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
I've been running it all along.

1274
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,040
Later, I also found

1275
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,880
a job in a livestream studio.

1276
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,920
I help people appraise and evaluate treasures.

1277
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay.

1278
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,760
So I work during the day and at night.

1279
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,720
That's why I have a lot of money.

1280
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,360
Anything else?

1281
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:42,720
No.

1282
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,280
That's all.

1283
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,480
Wait, the bell.

1284
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,960
We have to enter the next exhibition.

1285
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,520
Every time the bell rings,

1286
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,840
we must open the corresponding exhibition.

1287
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,440
Where is the next hall?

1288
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,400
I don't know either.

1289
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,880
You're the Ning guide.

1290
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,600
There's a sound.

1291
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,160
There's a sound inside.

1292
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,280
Hurry, lead the way.

1293
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,600
Is this the second hall?

1294
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,800
Then...

1295
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,640
The second exhibition is signaled by sound.

1296
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,680
Participants will recreate Tui Sanniang

1297
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,200
and resonate with the legend of the sea.

1298
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,640
After completing the interactive version,

1299
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,760
the "Classic Eternal Ship" will set sail.

1300
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,240
The cabin is open.

1301
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,240
The cabin.

1302
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,800
What?

1303
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,400
Interactive version, full version.

1304
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,360
What is this?

1305
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,480
Tui Sanniang's.

1306
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,000
Treasure.

1307
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,880
Treasure map.

1308
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,720
Let me show you.

1309
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,440
Good kid.

1310
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,080
Nice, accurate.

1311
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,680
You...

1312
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,080
Good thing you're not the bride, I'm telling you.

1313
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:00,880
No.

1314
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,640
What's this?

1315
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,800
First, press the full version button.

1316
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,920
Listen to the legendary resonance between Tui San Niang and the sea.

1317
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,960
While imitating the sounds of sea creatures,

1318
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,480
participants need to imitate

1319
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,560
the movements of those creatures one by one.

1320
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,520
Walk from the starting point to the finish line.

1321
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,240
After all participants reach the finish line,

1322
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,760
line up in a column and walk back to the starting point.

1323
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,040
If the rhythm is correct, the sail will rise.

1324
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,520
If it's wrong, the sail will lower.

1325
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,960
Okay.

1326
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,000
You'll need to start over.

1327
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,560
Okay.

1328
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,680
Listen to the full version first.

1329
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,200
What's the second one?

1330
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,880
How does a sea frog sound?

1331
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,040
Got it now?

1332
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,720
So cool.

1333
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,480
Got it.

1334
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,920
Then let's each remember one ourselves.

1335
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,600
You learn it yourself.

1336
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,480
Learn your own sound.

1337
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:27,800
Okay.

1338
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,720
Mine is the hardest.

1339
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
I'm the sea frog.

1340
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,240
I'm the sea frog.

1341
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,200
I'm the sea frog.

1342
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,080
I already picked the sea frog.

1343
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,200
Which one are you?

1344
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,800
Then leave one for me after you choose.

1345
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,400
No one picked, just choose randomly.

1346
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,720
How does a sea frog sound?

1347
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,120
You be the frog.

1348
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,400
Press it.

1349
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,200
You have to do it like this.

1350
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,880
You have to.

1351
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,640
Right.

1352
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,000
You have to do it this way.

1353
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,080
Pick one, bro.

1354
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,000
Then I'll be the dolphin, okay?

1355
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,520
Then you're the dolphin.

1356
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,480
Okay, then I'll take this one.

1357
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,720
What is this?

1358
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,040
No.

1359
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,760
This one's too high.

1360
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,440
Lower it by an octave.

1361
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,480
You're a male dolphin.

1362
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,600
Seagull.

1363
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Okay, that's it.

1364
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,200
Actually, the two of us are very similar.

1365
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,440
It's like I'm a few octaves higher than you.

1366
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,240
Then yours...

1367
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,280
Sure.

1368
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,520
That works too.

1369
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,120
It's more natural this way, actually.

1370
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,080
Like that seagull has a hoarse voice.

1371
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,600
That's right.

1372
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,040
What are you?

1373
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,160
A seal.

1374
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,600
So cute.

1375
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,360
You have to do the tongue-rolling one.

1376
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,840
That one.

1377
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,560
How does it sound?

1378
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
You're amazing.

1379
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,040
I can do it.

1380
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,440
You give it to her.

1381
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,840
You give it to her.

1382
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,640
Can you do it?

1383
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,480
No.

1384
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,320
No, I want the seal.

1385
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,120
She wants this one.

1386
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,880
The seal.

1387
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,320
Okay.

1388
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,360
Come on.

1389
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,520
Come on.

1390
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,640
Remember your own rhythm.

1391
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,720
Everyone.

1392
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,640
Old man.

1393
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,800
Remember your own rhythm.

1394
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,560
Everyone has their own rhythm.

1395
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,520
Who are you calling old man?

1396
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
She said it.

1397
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,440
She said it.

1398
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,360
She said it.

1399
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,360
Who?

1400
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,720
Who?

1401
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,640
Who was the last one?

1402
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:10,960
Me.

1403
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,560
I can't let you press this.

1404
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,080
It's fine.

1405
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,840
Let's do it this way.

1406
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,400
You line up first.

1407
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,800
I'll run over after I press this. Come on.

1408
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,400
Come.

1409
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,360
Come.

1410
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
That's not right.

1411
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,600
It's rising.

1412
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:34,520
Let's go.

1413
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,360
What do you call it?

1414
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,680
Vertical line.

1415
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,080
Vertical line.

1416
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,520
Look.

1417
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,160
Let's do it again.

1418
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,800
Vertical line.

1419
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,720
Go back.

1420
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,320
Vertical line.

1421
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,560
Why aren't you lining up?

1422
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,520
Line up.

1423
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,920
What are you doing?

1424
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,560
What are you up to?

1425
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,880
Scold them in Nangyan language.

1426
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,800
They don't listen at all.

1427
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,080
Not giving any space at all.

1428
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,000
Watch the next move.

1429
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,400
There's a move coming up.

1430
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,680
The penguin brings good fortune to San Niang.

1431
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,520
How do you show bringing good fortune?

1432
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,160
Like this.

1433
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,320
The seal applauds for San Niang.

1434
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,480
The sea lion guards San Niang.

1435
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,360
The sea frog plays music for San Niang.

1436
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,320
The seagull delivers a message for San Niang.

1437
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,640
The dolphin leads the way for San Niang.

1438
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,640
Got it.

1439
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
I'll lead the way.

1440
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,560
You're moving in the dark.

1441
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,560
Some people, remember your positions.

1442
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,680
What are you saying? How could I forget?

1443
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:49,680
Alright.

1444
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:51,880
Come on.

1445
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,680
Line up.

1446
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,280
Line up.

1447
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,160
Alright, it's rising.

1448
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,080
Alright, it's rising.

1449
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,440
And then?

1450
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,720
Is this the legendary exhibition?

1451
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,440
What is this?

1452
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,960
Then set sail.

1453
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,840
The "Classic Eternal Ship" is about to set sail.

1454
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,480
Are we supposed to get on the ship?

1455
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,360
What happens if we get on the ship? Get on the ship.

1456
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,080
If you get on, it really takes off.

1457
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,560
Is there a mechanism?

1458
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,720
There's not really any mechanism.

1459
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,440
Let's look for clues, everyone.

1460
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,600
Next, let's go to Bai's room.

1461
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,480
Let's take a look.

1462
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,800
We're finally at Bai's.

1463
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,720
Where is your room?

1464
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,640
Second floor.

1465
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,640
This song is so catchy.

1466
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,720
Bai's room is right there.

1467
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,520
Okay.

1468
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,680
Welcome to Bai's "Nonsense" room.

1469
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,760
After drawing on white paper, draw on black paper.

1470
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,480
I'm an emerging artist.

1471
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,560
Wait, why?

1472
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,120
You can draw?

1473
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:55,880
What about the "dash"?

1474
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,480
Because I'm an artist.

1475
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,480
I found one.

1476
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,080
Big brother is so handsome.

1477
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,440
Okay, there's a delivery.

1478
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,000
Push five four six nine.

1479
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,720
Old treasure.

1480
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,640
You can't be...

1481
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
You can't be...

1482
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,960
Push the previous wave.

1483
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,160
You don't have an age.

1484
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,320
The man in the drawing, age unknown.

1485
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,440
Age unknown.

1486
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,040
Suitable for people over sixty.

1487
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,640
You're already sixty.

1488
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,680
Are you still in good shape?

1489
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,240
How old are you this year, really? This year?

1490
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,040
I don't know.

1491
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,960
How can you not know?

1492
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,640
Because I lose my memory every six months.

1493
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,000
Why?

1494
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,920
No reason.

1495
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,400
Yes, that's right.

1496
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,560
Start explaining.

1497
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,600
I lose my memory once every six months.

1498
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,040
The first time I lost my memory was two years ago.

1499
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,600
I woke up on the street.

1500
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,720
I only had a tattered cloth bag with me.

1501
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,800
And a small box.

1502
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,720
This is it.

1503
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,560
Take a look. Open it.

1504
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,240
It says "Dash" on it.

1505
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,160
I can't forget this person who is

1506
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:48,880
important to me.

1507
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,600
I don't know.

1508
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm not saying I forgot because of amnesia, I just don't know.

1509
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,280
I found some very important evidence.

1510
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,640
A drawing on white paper.

1511
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,480
On this paper,

1512
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,760
these symbols

1513
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,920
are they pointing us

1514
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,600
to look for clues in your phone?

1515
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,480
Why?

1516
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,920
Because I think it's very likely

1517
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,680
that the WeChat icon it's pointing to

1518
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,480
means that in your phone

1519
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,000
there are some useful clues.

1520
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,160
Because don't I lose my memory

1521
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,399
every six months?

1522
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,800
When I saw this paper

1523
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,160
I felt it was very

1524
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,560
familiar.

1525
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,720
So then I

1526
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,720
opened the

1527
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,560
Tongcheng Travel app on my phone.

1528
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,279
There are train tickets and flight tickets on it,

1529
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,240
as well as hotels and guesthouses.

1530
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,920
Then I discovered

1531
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,399
that at the end of 2024,

1532
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:35,479
through Tongcheng Travel,

1533
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,399
I booked a flight and hotel

1534
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,399
to a small fishing village.

1535
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,439
Finally found it.

1536
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,319
The home where I once lived.

1537
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,439
I can only say it's thanks to Tongcheng Travel

1538
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,600
that I was able to remember this information.

1539
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,160
So, here's something.

1540
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,479
I think this information is quite important.

1541
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:50,600
It's a text message.

1542
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,520
In June 2024,

1543
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,120
someone said,

1544
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,720
"I'm the painting buyer."

1545
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,640
"I saw some of your paintings,"

1546
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,399
"I really like them,"

1547
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,479
"I can buy them at a high price."

1548
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:02,920
The last time I woke up,

1549
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I was at home.

1550
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,240
I didn't know who I was either.

1551
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,000
But there were many paintings around me.

1552
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,520
Later, I had to survive.

1553
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,720
So I used my inspiration to create three paintings.

1554
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,120
I put them online.

1555
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,720
I didn't know how much to sell them for.

1556
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,120
I said, let's sell them for three hundred.

1557
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,279
But the buyer said,

1558
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:20,760
"Three million."

1559
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,080
"Alright, no problem. Deal."

1560
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,520
Suddenly, I got rich.

1561
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,439
Suddenly, I got rich.

1562
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,000
Do you still remember

1563
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,080
the three paintings you sold him before,

1564
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,800
the abstract ones?

1565
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,560
Do you remember what they were?

1566
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,359
Architecture.

1567
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:29,840
Architecture.

1568
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,640
Architectural themes.

1569
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,279
Alright.

1570
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,000
About half a year passed

1571
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
That is, March 13th

1572
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,960
A few days ago

1573
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,040
Yesterday

1574
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,640
He took the initiative to message someone, saying

1575
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,439
I've recently had new inspiration for my artwork

1576
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,279
How about March 15th

1577
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,399
Let's meet at Pirate Mansion

1578
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,520
What does this mean

1579
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,000
Yes, these past couple of days I've had a bit

1580
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,160
of that inspiration I get when drawing architecture

1581
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,400
So I wanted to draw it quickly

1582
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,520
And since I was out of money

1583
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,480
I thought I'd contact him again and say

1584
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,640
I'll give it to you, sell it to you

1585
01:09:59,160 --> 01:09:59,680
Okay

1586
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,440
Then what is this

1587
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,840
Dear Mr. Baizhihua, hello

1588
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,960
Because in July 2024

1589
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,240
due to a car accident

1590
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,000
you underwent three plastic surgeries at our hospital

1591
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,920
including skull repair and nasal bridge reconstruction

1592
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,600
and facial contouring

1593
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,560
We especially remind you to take care of your health during recovery

1594
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,560
You really are something.

1595
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,480
Changing your face and your mind again.

1596
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,320
Ever since that car accident,

1597
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,280
I keep dreaming of a small fishing village.

1598
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,520
And someone standing there.

1599
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,680
Then I started to wonder if this

1600
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,320
had something to do with my background or my family.

1601
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,840
Maybe I’m actually from that fishing village.

1602
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,080
So I kept working hard

1603
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,200
to find that place.

1604
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,240
I finally found it.

1605
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,680
I asked the local elders,

1606
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,360
if there was a man

1607
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,440
who always stood by the sea waiting for a boat or something.

1608
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,320
There was a man.

1609
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,400
I felt that this man

1610
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,960
must be my father.

1611
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,840
Otherwise, in my memory,

1612
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,800
it wouldn’t be so vivid.

1613
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,480
The silhouette of my father.

1614
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,440
Right.

1615
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,760
So maybe at that time, my dad

1616
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,200
got on that ship, the “Dash” or whatever it was called.

1617
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,840
And then, because of that accident,

1618
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,480
he died.

1619
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,040
I see.

1620
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,840
So I hired a private detective to investigate.

1621
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,640
I didn’t expect the ship to be called “Dash.”

1622
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,080
This...

1623
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,800
Dear Mr. Baizhihua, hello.

1624
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,080
Regarding the matter you asked us to investigate,

1625
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,080
on January 1st, 2020,

1626
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,720
the "Dash" shipwreck,

1627
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,040
was caused by Captain Tui Qianlang's negligence.

1628
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,720
The captain had been warned before departure

1629
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,640
that the sea conditions were bad and it was not suitable to sail.

1630
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,680
But he ignored the warning and insisted on going.

1631
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,920
This ultimately led to a disaster.

1632
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,720
I think my father's death

1633
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,760
was caused by them.

1634
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,120
That's why I want to find out the truth about the accident.

1635
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,200
I found this in the office.

1636
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,400
People close to the three of you

1637
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,840
were all on the "Dash" at some point.

1638
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,440
Yes.

1639
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,600
So you already know

1640
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,920
that Tui Qianlang's mistake

1641
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,320
led to your father's death.

1642
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,240
Yes.

1643
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,520
Let's go take a look.

1644
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,920
Ning's room.

1645
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm right next door to him.

1646
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,400
Who is this?

1647
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,520
Isn't this his father?

1648
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,160
This is a mermaid.

1649
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,760
Isn't this a human upper body?

1650
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,400
Why do you have this

1651
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,720
on your bed?

1652
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,880
It's very strange.

1653
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,680
It's my personal preference, is that okay?

1654
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,320
Okay.

1655
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,840
These handcuffs are my personal hobby.

1656
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,120
It's my personal preference, is that not acceptable?

1657
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,520
What's wrong?

1658
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,160
It's okay, I remember you.

1659
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:09,880
Who?

1660
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:12,360
Who?

1661
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,560
Isn't this Baba Liu?

1662
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,600
What is Baba Liu to you?

1663
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,880
Baba Liu is your son.

1664
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,920
Who?

1665
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,000
Baba Liu is his son.

1666
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,440
Hurry.

1667
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,360
Quick, call him "Dad."

1668
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,640
Call him "Grandpa."

1669
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,880
Grandpa Ning.

1670
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,120
Grandpa Ning.

1671
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,600
Grandpa Ning.

1672
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,400
That's too much.

1673
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,240
I always dream of someone standing there.

1674
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,200
Does this figure from behind look like the one in your painting?

1675
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,320
The person looking at "Dash."

1676
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,240
It seems so.

1677
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,000
Why are all three paintings like this?

1678
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The first gift for Dad.

1679
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,720
You are his son.

1680
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,200
So who is whose father, exactly?

1681
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,560
Start explaining.

1682
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,920
Introduce yourself to everyone.

1683
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,680
I make a living as a fisherman.

1684
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,240
A boatman.

1685
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,400
Back in 2001,

1686
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,960
I suddenly met the woman of my dreams.

1687
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,160
This girl was named Qi Ji.

1688
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,840
She came to our small fishing village

1689
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,960
to be the owner of a bookstore.

1690
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,920
Then I fell in love with her.

1691
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,560
A year after we got married, we had a child.

1692
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,440
The child's name is Ning Nuannuan.

1693
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,160
One day, I went out fishing.

1694
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,240
When I came back,

1695
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,920
I found that my wife and daughter

1696
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,720
had disappeared.

1697
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:04,640
After that,

1698
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,760
I spent the rest of my life searching for my wife

1699
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,960
and my daughter.

1700
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,360
By the end of 2019,

1701
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,480
the captain of the "Dash" said

1702
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,640
he once saw a girl

1703
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,320
with a sunflower birthmark on her back.

1704
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,120
This girl with the sunflower birthmark

1705
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,840
is my daughter, Ning Nuannuan.

1706
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:24,960
Later, I found out

1707
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,160
that the "Dash" captain's son, Tui Houlang,

1708
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,080
opened a club here.

1709
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,760
So I came to work at this club.

1710
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,480
I also have a sunflower

1711
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,760
on my left shoulder, but it's a tattoo.

1712
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,000
A tattoo.

1713
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,760
My sister disappeared, and after she came back,

1714
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,440
she got a tattoo on her left shoulder

1715
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,720
of a sunflower.

1716
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,840
It's your sister?

1717
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,480
I have one too.

1718
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:48,960
Is this your sister?

1719
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,120
This is you

1720
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,720
This is you when you came yesterday

1721
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Then you got soaked by the rain

1722
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,440
"Jerk"

1723
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,600
Why are you secretly taking pictures of people?

1724
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,000
Because of your back

1725
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,440
this shirt got soaked by the rain.

1726
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,800
You are a "jerk."

1727
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,680
What? What are you talking about?

1728
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,480
She arrived at four in the afternoon.

1729
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,400
It happened to be raining.

1730
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,360
Then after she came in,

1731
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,200
she got drenched.

1732
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,680
So I handed her a towel.

1733
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,760
I told her to dry off the rain.

1734
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,840
At that moment,

1735
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,680
I saw your clothes were soaked.

1736
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,000
Soaked, and then here was revealed

1737
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,320
a special tattoo.

1738
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,440
Because my daughter has this

1739
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,880
exact same birthmark on her back.

1740
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,520
But mine is a tattoo.

1741
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,920
So I misunderstood.

1742
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,440
I thought you were my daughter, right?

1743
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,280
It's possible.

1744
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,120
It could be.

1745
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,120
There's a chance.

1746
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,880
But while I was waiting at the dock,

1747
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,000
I saw a little boy.

1748
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,320
He was just sitting there alone.

1749
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,720
So I asked him, "What's your name?"

1750
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,640
He said,

1751
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,720
"I don't know my name."

1752
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,000
He had lost his memory.

1753
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,320
I thought the boy looked pitiful.

1754
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,240
So I took him home.

1755
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,600
I told him, "From now on, your name is Xiao Ning."

1756
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
He's an adopted son, you could say.

1757
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,400
But this adopted son

1758
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,360
has had a big hobby since he was little:

1759
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,080
looking for beautiful women.

1760
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,280
What?

1761
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,600
What does that mean?

1762
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,480
That's right—drawing.

1763
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,040
Ning

1764
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,400
Ning

1765
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,760
Turns out it was my Uncle Ning.

1766
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,840
But one day, after I came home,

1767
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,640
I discovered something.

1768
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,280
He suddenly didn't recognize who I was.

1769
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,640
I said it was okay.

1770
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,960
Even if you can't remember

1771
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,120
some things about yourself,

1772
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,680
I can still take care of you.

1773
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,000
But every year, I tell you

1774
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,320
I'm your father.

1775
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,520
I'm your dad.

1776
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,320
That's right.

1777
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,400
It was originally a very touching story.

1778
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,760
I'm your dad.

1779
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,400
That's right, and I also told him

1780
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,680
your name is Xiao Ning, and what we've been through.

1781
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,120
I would help him remember.

1782
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,320
So in 2020,

1783
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,440
he drew this picture.

1784
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,960
In 2021,

1785
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,960
he drew another one.

1786
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,320
The first gift for his dad.

1787
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,440
He kept losing his memory.

1788
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,440
But one day, again after I came home,

1789
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,280
I suddenly found that Xiao Ning was gone.

1790
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,800
This painting is exactly

1791
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,040
If I ever have another chance in this life

1792
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,600
to take a family photo like this

1793
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,520
I would sing a high C out of happiness

1794
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,600
I painted this picture

1795
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,600
I really don't think he needed to paint it

1796
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,680
It's nothing compared to your son's painting

1797
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,000
Yes, my son is a genius

1798
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,360
He will always be the best

1799
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,280
My son will always be the best

1800
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,720
Son, look at your "silly" son

1801
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:34,840
He's over here saying

1802
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,720
My son will always be the best

1803
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,280
And you're over here

1804
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,160
He's my big brother and also my father

1805
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:42,880
Dad

1806
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,240
Son

1807
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,080
Dad

1808
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,320
Dad

1809
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:46,880
Son

1810
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,360
I thought that kid looked pretty pitiful

1811
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,360
So I brought him home

1812
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,080
I said, from now on, you'll be called Xiao Ning

1813
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,160
My son is a genius

1814
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,600
He will always be the best

1815
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,360
Ning

1816
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,000
I said it's okay

1817
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,360
Even if you can't remember

1818
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,560
some things about yourself

1819
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,040
I can still take care of you

1820
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,520
Dad

1821
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,160
Son

1822
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:08,520
Dad

1823
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,160
Dad

1824
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,880
Son

1825
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,520
Is it really this crazy?

1826
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,880
Then I want to ask, are you Baba Liu?

1827
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,160
It's okay, I remember you

1828
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,960
This is you

1829
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,280
You are Baba Liu.

1830
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,520
You're still alive.

1831
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,440
This is you.

1832
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,200
You are Baba Liu.

1833
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,080
Can you accept it?

1834
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,200
No matter how much you don't want to accept this reality,

1835
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,320
I haven't.

1836
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,080
Not accepting it won't help. This is reality.

1837
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,120
Is your amnesia congenital

1838
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,160
or because of that car accident?

1839
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,520
Right, ask my dad.

1840
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,440
My dad knows I've been like this since I was a kid.

1841
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,960
He can't even remember what happened last year.

1842
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,760
And now you're asking him about something from twenty years ago?

1843
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,200
Isn't that a joke?

1844
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,360
You muddle-headed detective.

1845
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:01,840
You detective.

1846
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
I'm really speechless with you, detective.

1847
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,720
What is this?

1848
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,320
Okay.

1849
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,560
So cool.

1850
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,200
Growing old together, chatting slowly.

1851
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,080
Chatting slowly.

1852
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,600
2001.

1853
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,920
I want to grow old with you.

1854
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,880
And you still say you're not my daughter.

1855
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,520
Because this is for me and my...

1856
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,400
Qi Ji's favorite song to hear me sing.

1857
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,360
The most romantic thing I can think of

1858
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,000
is buying a computer with you.

1859
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,760
Buy a computer.

1860
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,520
When Qi Ji left home,

1861
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,800
she tore this photo in half.

1862
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,080
She took her half with her.

1863
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,840
Like this.

1864
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,880
Hat—I just turned over the hat.

1865
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,400
Like this.

1866
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,120
Found it.

1867
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:00,000
Second exhibit, main building, first floor atrium.

1868
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,120
Two chimes.

1869
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Use the sound-activated mechanism to make a sound.

1870
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,200
The lower half of the paper.

1871
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,040
First exhibit.

1872
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,000
Annex.

1873
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,800
One chime.

1874
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,120
Until everyone is finished.

1875
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,960
I'll open the door for them.

1876
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,880
The ritual is complete.

1877
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,920
I'm going to scare them to death.

1878
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,680
To make sure they'll scream in fright,

1879
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,440
I'm going to prepare a terrifying sea monster costume.

1880
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,200
Back to the exhibition hall.

1881
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,280
So it was the boss scaring us.

1882
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,040
That sea monster.

1883
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,400
I think the costume was his.

1884
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,040
Yeah.

1885
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:25,760
That's right.

1886
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,520
Make the bell sound twice.

1887
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,440
Use the voice-activated device to make the sound.

1888
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,560
Lure them into imitating it.

1889
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,320
The rhythm.

1890
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,800
The rhythm, guys.

1891
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,560
No wonder you were running around over there.

1892
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,320
So enthusiastic.

1893
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,840
I thought you were a good person.

1894
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,520
I didn't expect this.

1895
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,200
My big brother is a good person.

1896
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,120
He's not your big brother anymore.

1897
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,440
My uncle is a good person.

1898
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,080
What "dam"? Like the Three Gorges?

1899
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:54,920
Speak properly.

1900
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,040
Alright.

1901
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,920
Set the boat on fire to finish the exhibition.

1902
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,800
After all three exhibitions are over,

1903
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,440
we can kill them.

1904
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,680
Here's the situation.

1905
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,480
Let me explain this.

1906
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,560
This is...

1907
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,680
Well, I...

1908
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,760
I originally needed to talk to him about something.

1909
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,160
And then,

1910
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,560
when I walked to the office door,

1911
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,920
I saw him shredding papers there.

1912
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,160
When he left, I just tore it off directly.

1913
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,400
After all three exhibitions are over,

1914
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,480
we can kill them.

1915
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,320
So you know he wants to kill us.

1916
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,040
That's right.

1917
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,240
You think I'm your daughter.

1918
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,320
You want to protect me.

1919
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,520
You think I'm your son.

1920
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,440
I didn't know at that time.

1921
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,240
I just wanted to look after her.

1922
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,240
I went to save you.

1923
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,960
So I must have wanted to kill him.

1924
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,480
I need to find a way to kill him.

1925
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,440
To stop him from killing you.

1926
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,160
What idea did you come up with?

1927
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:44,880
I haven't thought of one yet.

1928
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,240
Now we can gather everyone's motives

1929
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,520
and put them together.

1930
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,640
Let's sort out the timeline.

1931
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,400
Okay.

1932
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,000
Okay.

1933
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,360
Let's go check the lounge.

1934
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,240
Let's go.

1935
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,000
Come on, let's sit down.

1936
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,480
Come over here, sit here.

1937
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:17,960
Alright.

1938
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,880
Can you be my goddaughter?

1939
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,400
Actually, I just think that...

1940
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,520
Otherwise, for no reason at all,

1941
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,960
why would I get a tattoo?

1942
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,880
In a way, it actually represents me.

1943
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,240
Don't even think about inheriting my property.

1944
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,720
You won't get any of the money.

1945
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,840
I'm richer than you.

1946
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,560
Just kidding.

1947
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,600
I'm richer than you.

1948
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,240
You've been to my room.

1949
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,920
That's true, I'm just a fisherman.

1950
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,880
But it doesn't matter.

1951
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,120
We can be like godfather and goddaughter.

1952
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:48,520
Okay.

1953
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,360
I can give you the love I have for my daughter.

1954
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:50,760
Is that alright?

1955
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,200
Sure, no problem.

1956
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,040
I don't approve of this marriage.

1957
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,520
I don't approve of this marriage.

1958
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,440
What does this have to do with you?

1959
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,800
On my left shoulder,

1960
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,080
I have this birthmark.

1961
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:05,960
I don't believe it.

1962
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,080
So you really do have a birthmark, right?

1963
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,720
Yes.

1964
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:09,960
Yes.

1965
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,600
Ba Jiaoshan.

1966
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,880
You've already stolen my beauty.

1967
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,920
And now you want to take away the only father I have left.

1968
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,840
You have a tattoo.

1969
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,560
I have a birthmark.

1970
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:28,880
Go away.

1971
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,680
Didn't you say your sister has one of those?

1972
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,760
My sister has a tattoo.

1973
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,400
So I saved her sister.

1974
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,240
Her sister might have seen my tattoo.

1975
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,120
She wants to live using my identity.

1976
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,360
So you are...

1977
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,520
Nuannuan.

1978
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,760
You are the eldest dad.

1979
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,400
Call him grandpa.

1980
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,400
Hurry.

1981
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,680
Quick, call him dad.

1982
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,760
You are the eldest dad.

1983
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,800
Eldest dad.

1984
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,200
Eldest dad.

1985
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,760
My daughter.

1986
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,040
Daughter.

1987
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,800
Goddaughter.

1988
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,400
Godson.

1989
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,760
The four of us

1990
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,680
are no longer people without close relationships.

1991
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,560
We all have them now.

1992
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,120
No one is born an island.

1993
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,480
Who is born without close relationships?

1994
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,320
Everyone is raised by parents.

1995
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,800
We are each other's close relationships.

1996
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,640
Come on, stand up and join us in the circle.

1997
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,480
We're reunited.

1998
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,000
You really are the big boss.

1999
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,240
My stocks are really...

2000
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,760
It's fine, I am the stock.

2001
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,440
My name is "Big Drop."

2002
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,200
"Big Drop."

2003
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,160
Okay.

2004
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,040
The whole family are suspects.

2005
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,480
So today's case is actually

2006
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,520
four people working together.

2007
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,920
The four of you committed the crime as a group.

2008
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,320
What are you talking about?

2009
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,960
Didn't we just recognize each other now?

2010
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,000
Let's summarize everyone's motives.

2011
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,800
Ning Jiedai's motive for murder is

2012
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,760
My motive for murder

2013
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,040
is because I discovered

2014
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,440
that Jin Shangbao is my daughter.

2015
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,280
But at the same time, I also found out

2016
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,080
that Tui Houlang wanted to kill me

2017
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,240
and my daughter.

2018
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,080
So to protect myself and my daughter,

2019
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,920
I had to kill him.

2020
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,840
Jin Shangbao's motive for murder

2021
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,040
is because she discovered

2022
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,320
Tui Houlang is connected to the disappearance of the older sister.

2023
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,040
That's right.

2024
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,720
So, to avenge his sister,

2025
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,360
he wants to kill

2026
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,520
Tui Houlang.

2027
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,560
Baizhihua.

2028
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,880
What happened?

2029
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,120
Avenge his father.

2030
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,880
I want to ask Bai something.

2031
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,640
It wasn't Tui Houlang who killed his father.

2032
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,360
From his perspective,

2033
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,680
it was Tui Houlang's father

2034
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,720
who killed his father.

2035
01:26:59,160 --> 01:26:59,920
Yes.

2036
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,280
So his logic is "the son pays for the father's sins."

2037
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:02,960
Is that what you mean?

2038
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,240
Because I found that

2039
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,360
"Senior Treasure" thing.

2040
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,760
I started thinking,

2041
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,080
Tui Houlang is not even sixty years old.

2042
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,800
Is it possible that

2043
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,760
Tui Qianlang is still alive,

2044
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,400
and he and his son planned

2045
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,720
this murder together?

2046
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,400
That makes sense.

2047
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,120
Then you and Ba...

2048
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,080
The same.

2049
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,680
And he always brings that medicine in.

2050
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,560
I wonder if it's because of this.

2051
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,120
Dad is still alive.

2052
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,400
Also thinks his dad is still alive.

2053
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,080
Yes.

2054
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,200
Then your motive is also weak.

2055
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,360
Because you think his dad is still alive.

2056
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,200
So there's no need to kill Tui Houlang.

2057
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:45,560
Right.

2058
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,920
It's not very direct.

2059
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,520
Yes.

2060
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,600
These are the motives of the four people.

2061
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,520
But actually, just now,

2062
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,000
after coming out of Ning's room, there was a point—

2063
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,160
All four of you

2064
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,600
have all been in his room, right?

2065
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,200
Yes.

2066
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,040
When I walked to the office door,

2067
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,400
I saw him shredding paper there.

2068
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,640
When he left, I tore it off directly.

2069
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,880
After all three exhibitions ended,

2070
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,960
they could be killed.

2071
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,640
I found this in the manager's office.

2072
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,920
Next, you went to

2073
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,080
Tui Houlang's office.

2074
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,040
You took a photo of his coat.

2075
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,160
Yes.

2076
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,080
During the first performance,

2077
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,800
I was in his study

2078
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,080
and saw a promotional poster about his rise to success.

2079
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,240
The culprit must know

2080
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,640
this—

2081
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,560
the entire process of his ritual.

2082
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,680
Entered the room

2083
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,040
Only the person who saw the note in front

2084
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,120
could carry out the crime

2085
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,160
When we went to that room

2086
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,200
the shredder was open

2087
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,480
The killer opened the shredder

2088
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,560
and saw what was inside

2089
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:41,760
If you haven't seen that paper

2090
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,040
you can't follow this plan

2091
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,960
to kill the boss

2092
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,800
What he said makes sense

2093
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,680
So that torn half

2094
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,920
was only seen by you

2095
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,920
Only I saw it, yes

2096
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,160
After all three exhibitions are over

2097
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,240
then they can be killed

2098
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,120
His motive for wanting to kill us

2099
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,080
is also only known by you

2100
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,240
Right, only I know he wants to kill me

2101
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,000
But all three of them wanted to kill him too

2102
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,560
Yes

2103
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,000
They just used the plan

2104
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,800
I don't know what his plan is

2105
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,400
Although, bro, I think you're also very suspicious

2106
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,560
But I still support you

2107
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,440
Next, we'll enter the X confirmation phase

2108
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,160
The exciting part is coming

2109
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,080
I'll be watching you

2110
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,680
If you are X

2111
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,960
What kind of act would you put on when you come back

2112
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,440
Let's not analyze this anymore

2113
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,200
Can we switch

2114
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,520
He's still okay

2115
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,920
Feels kind of steady

2116
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,480
Are you X

2117
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,080
You're acting a bit strange, you know

2118
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,560
Next, what we need to do

2119
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,480
is search this place.

2120
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,840
Because last night

2121
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:30,840
at six o'clock

2122
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,240
we had a dinner here, right?

2123
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,520
March 13th, 6 PM.

2124
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,800
At the Pirate Mansion's reception hall

2125
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,160
we enjoyed a special meal.

2126
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:39,880
Right.

2127
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,120
Yes.

2128
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,800
So that was before the incident.

2129
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,080
It's the last place the victim visited.

2130
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,560
There might be some clues left behind.

2131
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:47,960
Right?

2132
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,360
Yes, key clues.

2133
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:49,720
Come on.

2134
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,520
Let's start searching.

2135
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,120
Let's look around here.

2136
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,200
Health tonic syrup.

2137
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,480
This is probably something the elderly would use.

2138
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:01,560
There's nothing here.

2139
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,080
It's empty.

2140
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,640
So many medicines.

2141
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,640
"Elderly Treasure"

2142
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,040
"Healthy Medicine"

2143
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,000
"Good Luck 99"

2144
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,840
"Live Long"

2145
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,520
"Full of Vitality"

2146
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,040
"Longevity Medicine"

2147
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,040
A little more good luck, please.

2148
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,120
Let me have great luck this year.

2149
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,800
A little more good luck, please.

2150
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,720
Good luck forever

2151
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,520
Good luck forever

2152
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,800
This is

2153
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,240
No

2154
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,560
I only want Good Luck 100

2155
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,160
What is this? Let me take a look

2156
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,360
1001 Liquid

2157
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,800
There's something on it

2158
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:01,760
Suitable for

2159
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,200
People over 25

2160
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,840
Adult men with slow exercise recovery

2161
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,680
Everything written on here is

2162
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,160
It's just that usually,

2163
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,280
he takes a lot of health supplements, right?

2164
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:21,680
Yes.

2165
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,280
He wants to live longer.

2166
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,600
I'm wondering if it's possible

2167
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,400
that this "Tui Qianlang" is actually still alive.

2168
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,880
He killed his own son.

2169
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,400
And continued living as his son.

2170
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,080
I also think he might still be alive.

2171
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,080
Because the new generation always replaces the old.

2172
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:41,800
Okay.

2173
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,680
Alright.

2174
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,720
I think it's possible

2175
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,280
that he never had a son at all.

2176
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,520
He just wanted to change his identity.

2177
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,840
Then claimed to be his own son.

2178
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,120
Saying he's his own son.

2179
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,080
Right, that's "Tui Houlang."

2180
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,400
"Tui Houlang" is actually "Tui Qianlang."

2181
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,240
If we go by her earlier theory,

2182
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,200
that would mean

2183
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,840
the killer knows he is "Tui Qianlang."

2184
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,720
"Tui Qianlang."

2185
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,360
It's possible.

2186
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,680
Both of you have motives for murder.

2187
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:13,680
Now your motives are completely valid.

2188
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,600
So, you two

2189
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,000
are the only ones who had contact with "Laonianbao."

2190
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,360
Yes.

2191
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,040
You also saw the package that was delivered.

2192
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,800
The package, that's right.

2193
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,480
So you would also think

2194
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,000
that "Tui Houlang" might actually be "Tui Qianlang."

2195
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,440
Or after investigating,

2196
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,280
you two are the main suspects now.

2197
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,680
No, that's impossible. I'm not a suspect.

2198
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,280
Alright, son, I'll protect you.

2199
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:31,800
No.

2200
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,160
Isn't there still another bag?

2201
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,560
There is.

2202
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,120
Health tonic syrup.

2203
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:58,920
"Poison In, Poison Out."

2204
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,880
Should we check the flowerpot?

2205
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,720
Is there?

2206
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,520
Yes.

2207
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,360
Health tonic syrup.

2208
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:05,760
Used together with "Live Longer."

2209
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,920
It was poisoned.

2210
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,000
This "Poison In, Poison Out"—

2211
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,440
There's a backup behind it.

2212
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,080
It's colorless and tasteless.

2213
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,760
Once ingested,

2214
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,960
death will occur exactly twelve hours later.

2215
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,320
Anyone who takes the poison

2216
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,480
after fifteen hours

2217
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,800
will develop black markings on their body.

2218
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,280
So it's possible

2219
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,680
he wasn't drowned.

2220
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,000
Instead, twelve hours earlier,

2221
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:33,360
Impossible.

2222
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,080
he was poisoned.

2223
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,680
It's possible.

2224
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,160
Because it was put into this

2225
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,600
health tonic syrup.

2226
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,400
So yesterday, someone

2227
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,720
poisoned him here.

2228
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,200
Exactly twelve hours later,

2229
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,640
the poison took effect.

2230
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,120
Then he didn't turn black.

2231
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,680
So now we can go back and check.

2232
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,560
Because after twelve hours, he would die immediately.

2233
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,640
Black lines appear after fifteen hours.

2234
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,120
That means

2235
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,000
if we go back and look at the body

2236
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,800
to see if there are black lines,

2237
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:02,240
we can determine

2238
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,800
whether he was killed by this "Du Lai Du Wang" poison

2239
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,480
and died from poisoning,

2240
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,200
or if he drowned.

2241
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,040
That's right.

2242
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,520
Okay.

2243
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,120
Alright?

2244
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,000
Alright, let's go back and check.

2245
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,480
Let's go.

2246
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,760
Let's go confirm that now.

2247
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:16,760
Who is this?

2248
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:18,200
Who is it?

2249
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,480
They ran away.

2250
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,000
Come back!

2251
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,120
Look at his neck.

2252
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,400
Exactly twelve hours.

2253
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,680
The poison activates right on time.

2254
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,560
Why would someone poisoned be soaked in water?

2255
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,360
It's on the wine glass.

2256
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,440
How could he make sure the poison was put in his glass?

2257
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,920
Unless he's from here,

2258
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,560
an employee,

2259
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,400
a receptionist.

2260
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,920
Only you knew he wanted to kill us.

2261
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,640
There are two murderers.

2262
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,840
Then if that's the case,

2263
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,200
is it possible that there are three people involved?

2264
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,120
A series of crimes.

2265
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,800
How did the hair turn white?

2266
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,720
Then he must be the one who aged.

2267
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,120
Who do you suspect now? Tell me.

2268
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,560
I'm wondering if it's possible

2269
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,280
that this "Tui Qianlang" is still alive.

2270
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,720
Living on as his own son.

2271
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,240
He is his own son.

2272
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,320
If I knew he wanted to kill me,

2273
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,320
I would just leave with my daughter.

2274
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,680
I might not acknowledge you.

2275
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,760
It doesn't matter if you don't.

2276
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,600
I'll do everything I can to ruin this gathering.

2277
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,280
That's enough.

2278
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:07,600
Let's go.

2279
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,280
There's a bag over there.

2280
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,080
It feels like something is guiding me

2281
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:10,920
to come here.

2282
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,800
There's treasure inside.

2283
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,880
Maybe this plan

2284
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,000
is actually the plan of the Tui Xian Group.

2285
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,600
Someone's here.

2286
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,360
Now we have both motive and method.

2287
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,000
All that's left is the timing.

2288
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,840
I want to ask,

2289
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,800
can we confirm that the person who poisoned

2290
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,000
and the person who tried to drown him are two different people?

2291
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,040
I think if you drown him in the water tank,

2292
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,120
he would definitely die, right?

2293
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,520
So why bother poisoning him as well?

2294
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,560
He wants revenge.

2295
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,960
No, that's not it. He knows he's alive.

2296
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,120
We're just assuming that...

2297
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,320
Do you want to acknowledge it?

2298
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,160
Come out.

2299
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:33,480
I don't.
