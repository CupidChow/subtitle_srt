00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,580
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

2
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,660
An unknown fog shrouds Tui City.

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,580
Players will experience

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,100
In each investigation, six players will be divided into

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,540
detectives, suspects, and the real culprit.

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,380
The real culprit's task is to hide their identity.

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,060
They must avoid being discovered by other players.

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,340
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie.

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,740
If the culprit passes a challenge,

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,980
they can choose one detective

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,819
to turn them into X.

12
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,820
Once blackened, X joins the culprit's team.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,740
During the following investigation,

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,780
they work together to help the culprit escape.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,980
After the investigation, players vote for the real culprit.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,260
If the culprit receives fewer votes than the other suspects,

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,060
the culprit and X win the golden key.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,860
Otherwise,

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,380
the players who voted correctly win the golden key.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,340
Bai Yu

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Dilraba

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,140
Jin Jing

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,140
Liu Yuning

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,100
Zhang Linghe

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,620
Zhou Keyu

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,460
You failed your missions several times before.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,380
There was an explosion.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,180
This time, I will send you

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,180
to be reborn in Tui Billion Film Company.

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,060
I hope that here,

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,380
you can successfully find clues about the mysterious person.

32
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,300
Dear fans,

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,460
Right now, I'm at

34
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,620
the casting site for the blockbuster project.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,619
Here's today's schedule announcement.

36
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,180
Which actor will have a turning point in their fate?

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,700
The answer will be revealed soon.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,900
My name is Prince Charming.

39
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,380
I'm just one blockbuster away

40
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,700
from becoming truly famous.

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,580
Truly famous.

42
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,300
My name is Golden Brand.

43
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,300
Let me see.

44
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,140
This is...

45
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,540
So handsome.

46
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,100
My name is...

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,140
I graduated from the acting class.

48
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,500
What is this?

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,140
A unicorn.

50
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,940
He's my prince charming.

51
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,700
I'm someone who'd rather have nothing than settle.

52
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,140
So handsome.

53
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,020
Why does he look so good in this?

54
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,980
This outfit...

55
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,900
Right?

56
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,900
Someone keeps kicking my mount.

57
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,100
You ride one.

58
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,340
Some cows want to kick horses.

59
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,060
Why do cows and horses have to fight?

60
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,660
What are you doing?

61
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,780
You're acting weird today, kind of...

62
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,660
He's been secretly filming us the whole time.

63
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,260
Yeah, you.

64
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,380
His role today is a paparazzo.

65
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,140
I think so, right?

66
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,260
My name is Ba Mian Linglong.

67
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,060
Deduced to

68
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,380
Deduction, this way please

69
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,380
He has the same style as you

70
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,020
Is that hair? All down there

71
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,700
Black collar

72
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,740
Black collar

73
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,380
Everyone, come down

74
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Let Deduction speak

75
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Come, you go up

76
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,900
Slow down, don't fall

77
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,060
Tui Billion Film Company

78
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,740
I am the director with a box office of ten billion.

79
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,460
Our company can truly be called

80
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,820
in the entire entertainment industry

81
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,500
so influential that just a single stomp

82
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,020
can shake the whole industry ecosystem.

83
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,060
Yes.

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,100
So,

85
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,300
joining Tui Billion Film Company

86
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,100
is like standing on the shoulders of giants

87
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,340
to see the world.

88
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,900
Director, can you open your eyes when you speak?

89
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,660
This is just how I look.

90
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,340
What do you mean?

91
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,260
You're being quite bold, young lady.

92
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Sorry.

93
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,940
Let me introduce this person.

94
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,060
This is my assistant director.

95
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,860
Assistant director.

96
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Assistant director.

97
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,140
Now, I’d like everyone

98
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,340
to introduce yourselves one by one.

99
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,060
Let’s get to know each other.

100
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,860
Is that alright?

101
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,020
Let’s start with this lovely young lady.

102
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,260
Me?

103
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,380
Me?

104
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,820
Both of you are very beautiful.

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,499
Let’s start from my left.

106
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,859
My name is Ba Mian Linglong, Director.

107
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,859
I was the Tui Art Star of 2021.

108
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,660
It’s an honor to stand here today.

109
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,340
2021?

110
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
What’s wrong?

111
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,500
I’m from 2023.

112
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,140
Hello, Director. I am Ning Que Wu Lan.

113
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,580

Promoting Art Stars.

115
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,620
I'm also the assistant to Ba Mian Ling Long.

116
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,820
I'm very happy to participate in this election.

117
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,460
Thank you.

118
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,300
Hello, Director.

119
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,020
I'm also a 2024 Promoting Art Star.

120
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,660
My name is Prince Baima.

121
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,540
That's all.

122
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,820
Just like his name, he has a lot of charisma.

123
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,740
Prince Charming.

124
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,020
Very charismatic.

125
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,260
Excuse me, please make way.

126
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,060
My wings are a bit wide.

127
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,180
Sorry, please let me through.

128
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,980
Hello, Director.

129
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,900
My name is Jinzizhaopai.

130
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm the 2023 Star of Tuoyi.

131
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm the apple of my family's eye.

132
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,100
Hello, Director.

133
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm Heheyouming.

134
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,100
And I was the 2022

135
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,780
Star of Tuoyi.

136
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,220
All I need is to star in your blockbuster film, Director.

137
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm the famous Heheyouming.

138
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,860
I hope you can live up to your name.

139
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,820
And truly become famous.

140
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,860
Just like the previous one,

141
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,140
who wants to shine like Jinzizhaopai.

142
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,060
I'm also the 2023 Star of Tuoyi.

143
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,140
My name is Kebanchushen.

144
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,740
So handsome.

145
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,980
Kebanchushen.

146
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,420
Professionally trained.

147
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,180
Trained.

148
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,580
Kebanchushen.

149
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,540
Last year,

150
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,260
after you graduated from Tuoyi,

151
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,060
I've been observing you all.

152
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,300
As

153
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,140
last year's six outstanding graduates,

154
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,020
I sincerely invite all of you

155
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,460
to join our boot camp.

156
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,340
I will also

157
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,980
evaluate your performance in the camp

158
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,580
to assign you roles.

159
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,820
Pairing.

160
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,180
Can you explain it for me?

161
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,060
Assignment

162
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,580
Assignment

163
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,580
Does everyone have confidence in themselves?

164
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,500
Yes

165
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,300
When it’s 12:30 later

166
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,180
we’ll be here

167
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,220
to hand out your role cards

168
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,460
For now

169
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,900
please take a break first

170
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,700
Let’s meet here at 12:30 sharp

171
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:06,980
Don’t leave

172
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,740
Don’t leave

173
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,580
Alright, director, be careful

174
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,260
Hope we can see the director again

175
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,460
Don’t die on us

176
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,180
Good luck

177
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,140
Are all the contestants from Star of Art this bold?

178
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,620
They get really into character

179
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,380
Director, stay safe

180
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,060
Take care, director

181
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,220
What do they mean by telling me to stay safe?

182
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,180
You’ll be fine, don’t worry

183
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,900
Let’s go then

184
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,580
Let’s go touch up our makeup

185
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,220
Do I have a private one?

186
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,140
Because I can’t

187
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,380
share a dressing room with others

188
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,420
I’ll get angry

189
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,380
You sure have a lot of quirks

190
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,940
Not famous, but plenty of quirks

191
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,460
This thing of yours is really in the way

192
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,540
Can you take it off?

193
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,540
You want to take off my wings

194
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,260
so I can’t escape your grasp

195
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,020
Everyone, find a place to rest

196
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,500
Okay

197
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:55,940
Let’s go

198
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,820
Let’s go

199
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,580
Let's go.

200
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,500
Take the poster photo.

201
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,420
You two, spread your feet a little.

202
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,460
Lower your height a bit.

203
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,980
Lower your height a bit.

204
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,900
Blame me.

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,940
It's too big, a bit too big.

206
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,700
Standing like that makes you look shorter.

207
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,020
Okay.

208
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,060
Three, two, one.

209
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,620
Everyone, get a little closer together.

210
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,020
Alright.

211
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,700
Yes, that's good.

212
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,940
Three, two, one.

213
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,700
Okay, that's good.

214
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,620
Thank you, great job.

215
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,300
Good work.

216
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,300
Full of energy.

217
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,020
You all arrived right on time.

218
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,900
Yes.

219
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,020
Very punctual.

220
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,620
These are the character cards for everyone.

221
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,420
But I can't give them to you yet.

222
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,580
I searched for a long time just now and didn't see Tuidao.

223
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,460
Did you see him?

224
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,300
No.

225
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,620
Didn't see him.

226
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,900
Wasn't he with you?

227
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,660
I've already checked many places.

228
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,540
Didn't find him anywhere.

229
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,140
The only place left is this abandoned warehouse.

230
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,860
That's so creepy.

231
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,220
Everyone, come with me to take a look.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,980
Everyone, come with me to take a look.

233
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,500
That's strange.

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,020
There's usually a key here.

235
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,420
Where's the key?

236
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,300
Could it be in the grass?

237
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,580
Does anyone have experience breaking down doors?

238
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,580
Bai Dapao

239
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,260
Come here

240
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,260
Is it that hard?

241
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,460
There's one right in front of you

242
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Come on

243
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,380
So cool

244
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,860
Stop

245
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,020
Don't do that

246
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,180
What's wrong?

247
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,780
What's wrong?

248
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,980
What's wrong?

249
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,500
Someone's dead

250
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,860
Tuidai is dead

251
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,180
What's going on?

252
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,700
Wait a second

253
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,260
Tuidai

254
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,100
I also hope we can see the director again

255
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
Please don't die

256
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,460
Director, be careful

257
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,220
Why did he lose weight?

258
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,180
Key

259
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,820
Storage room key

260
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,140
Something else broke

261
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,820
He's drooling too

262
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,900
What's going on?

263
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,980
Weren't you two just together?

264
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,220
Why is he here alone?

265
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,220
Yeah

266
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,100
We split up just now.

267
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,060
Where did you go?

268
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,180
Did you kill him?

269
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,580
Weren't you supposed to watch him?

270
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,420
We specifically reminded you before we left.

271
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,380
You had to keep an eye on him.

272
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm just a lackey.

273
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,700
And you have a motive for murder.

274
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,660
You're the assistant director.

275
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,700
If he dies, you become the director.

276
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,820
You'd be the chief director.

277
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,540
Your motive is way too strong.

278
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,620
You benefit the most from this.

279
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Just confess.

280
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,900
I've become the chief director.

281
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,180
I'm so happy.

282
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,700
Yeah.

283
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,420
Then I'll check.

284
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,180
Okay, go ahead and check.

285
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,820
Don't even think about destroying evidence.

286
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,700
I won't.

287
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,980
Let's check then.

288
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,820
Come on.

289
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,500
The watch shows that at eleven o'clock

290
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,940
he still had vital signs.

291
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,220
But after twelve, they disappeared.

292
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,460
So his time of death is

293
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,019
between eleven and twelve.

294
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:39,860
If that's the case,

295
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,940
the two of us are in the clear.

296
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,299
That means we can vouch for each other.

297
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,100
Why?

298
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,779
Because we've been rehearsing the opera the whole time.

299
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:49,940
What opera? Sing a part right now.

300
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,220
If you can't sing it, you're both lying for each other.

301
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,700
I'm not joking.

302
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,700
A lot of media came today.

303
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,580
And investors too.

304
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,540
They're all here for our movie.

305
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,020
Yes.

306
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,180
If they find out

307
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,380
that the billion-dollar director is dead,

308
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,540
our company is finished.

309
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,460
Our stock will plummet too.

310
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,380
The entertainment industry

311
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,420
The entertainment industry

312
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,940
Should I say those four words?

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,300
will just disappear.

314
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,780
So what should we do?

315
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,900
So you two need to secretly

316
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,580
take the lead in investigating this matter.

317
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,940
Make sure not to let this leak out.

318
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
If it gets out,

319
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,540
you two won't be able to stay in this business either.

320
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,700
That's a threat to both of you.

321
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,060
Can you handle it?

322
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,980
It's a bit hard to handle this kind of threat.

323
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,540
This is for everyone.

324
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,540
A tool for solving mysteries and reasoning.

325
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,300
Tongcheng is fully online.

326
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,580
This is Tongcheng Travel

327
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,940
the evidence search assistant tool prepared for everyone.

328
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,740
We hope it helps everyone sort out the clues.

329
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
And clarify the logical connections.

330
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,700
It's time to uncover the truth.

331
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,220
Let's set off together with Tongcheng.

332
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,380
Okay.

333
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,140
Then you two investigate in secret.

334
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,020
Remember to be careful.

335
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,220
I'll go handle the aftermath first.

336
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:16,980
Alright.

337
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm leaving it to you.

338
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,620
Okay.

339
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,420
Absolutely no leaks allowed.

340
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,940
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

341
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,900
Case Five officially begins.

342
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,500
It is now April 22, 2025.

343
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,100
12:30 PM.

344
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,860
The victim in this case is Tui Baiyi.

345
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,740
After a preliminary investigation,

346
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,060
the murderer has been narrowed down to

347
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,900
Ning Que Wu Lan,

348
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,380
Ke Ban Chushen,

349
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,780
Ba Mian Linglong,

350
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,500
Jin Zi Zhaopai.

351
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,620
Among these four people,

352
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,580
Bai Ma Wangzi and He He Youming

353
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,700
were with Tui Baiyi

354
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,900
the entire time before the victim's death.

355
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,820
They can be ruled out as suspects.

356
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,340
Therefore, you are the detectives for this case.

357
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Now, detectives,

358
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,980
please lead the suspects and begin the investigation.

359
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,460
Do the four of you have any

360
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,540
defense for yourselves?

361
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
I really hate that "petty official" face.

362
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,540
Seriously, me too. I feel the same way.

363
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,020
Alright, you have a problem.

364
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,860
Fine, go ahead and refute me.

365
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,340
Now, the four suspects, please talk about

366
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,100
your relationship with the deceased.

367
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,300
We were good buddies.

368
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,540
Good buddies.

369
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,820
A blockbuster director is your buddy?

370
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,540
No, just kidding.

371
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,380
I don't know him.

372
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,460
I'm just here to audition for his project.

373
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,900
He's a director I greatly admire.

374
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,700
That's all.

375
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm the actress he personally selected.

376
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,740
He personally selected you?

377
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
Yes.

378
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,540
So how did you two meet before?

379
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,660
He probably saw some of my work.

380
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,020
He's one of my fans.

381
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,740
Just like you.

382
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
I really hate that "petty person in power" look.

383
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,140
Seriously, me too.

384
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,700
Just like you.

385
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,900
As for me,

386
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
it's like the relationship between a talent scout and a rising star.

387
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,380
Because I once acted in

388
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,340
one of his works before.

389
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,540
It was called "Dead Ghost Blows the Lamp."

390
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,460
Seventeenth scene, only a silhouette.

391
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,620
He's my artist's talent scout.

392
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,140
And this time,

393
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,340
I was also lucky to be invited by him

394
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,380
to have a chance to act.

395
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,260
He's also my talent scout.

396
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,660
Why is he your talent scout?

397
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,220
He's her talent scout.

398
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,660
If he's her talent scout, he's your talent scout too?

399
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:25,940
That's right.

400
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,140
What's your relationship?

401
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,180
She is my...

402
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,340
She is my artist.

403
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,300
I am hers.

404
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
You are her "I" person.

405
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,940
E person, I person.

406
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,500
E person.

407
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,100
He is also my mentor.

408
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,340
I was in his...

409
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,260
...in "Dead Ghost Blows the Lamp".

410
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,340
...played one of the male roles, a specialty of mine.

411
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,300
Even later than me.

412
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,340
Right.

413
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,460
In "Dead Ghost Blows the Lamp", you...

414
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,540
What did you play?

415
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,660
I played a ghost.

416
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,620
I played a dead ghost.

417
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,860
And you? What is your relationship with the deceased?

418
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,220
You're asking me?

419
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Yes.

420
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,740
Speak.

421
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,860
I have no relationship with him.

422
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,740
I just came to audition for the male lead.

423
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,860
So that means next...

424
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,740
Are we all here to audition for the male lead?

425
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,220
Yes.

426
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,300
You are here for the audition.

427
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,900
I am already confirmed as the female lead.

428
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,580
If you're confirmed, why are you here?

429
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,940
Because I have the right to choose...

430
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,900
...who will be my partner.

431
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,700
Okay.

432
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,660
When we came in just now...

433
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,420
...the key to this storeroom was here.

434
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,620
Inside.

435
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,820
The key.

436
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,380
That means this is still a locked room.

437
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,540
A murder case.

438
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,220
Super soundproof storage room

439
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,260
No one would know if someone died in there

440
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,780
Let's examine the door lock

441
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,500
See if it can be locked from the inside

442
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,580
It's locked, it can be locked from the inside

443
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,820
Wait, hold on

444
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,540
Wait, here's how it works

445
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,700
You don't need a key to lock it from the inside

446
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,020
Why?

447
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,100
Because, look, for example

448
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,020
Right now, this is

449
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,460
Unlocked

450
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,180
It's not locked, right?

451
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,060
Now I've locked it from the inside

452
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,340
I can still close the door

453
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,780
It's a fake locked room

454
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,500
Right

455
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,140
Then he deliberately took this key

456
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,380
Locked it and left it here

457
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,620
Then went out and closed the door

458
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Right

459
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,820
Let's check the body

460
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,420
What?

461
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,020
There's a car key

462
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,940
There's a mark on his face

463
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,660
A scar

464
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,660
Is this a bowl?

465
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,980
There's blood

466
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,260
He put on a lot of lip balm

467
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,460
That

468
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,740
The lipstick murder case

469
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,380
What does this puddle of water mean?

470
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,740
It's his saliva

471
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,620
This is wet.

472
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,180
It's wet.

473
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,620
There must be something in that liquid.

474
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,700
This liquid is very likely the cause.

475
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,100
The thing that poisoned him.

476
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,780
Isn't there a kind of punishment like that?

477
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,860
Where you cover someone with this and pour water over them?

478
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,580
But at the scene,

479
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,660
there couldn't be just this little.

480
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,820
So what does that mean?

481
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,620
Did he drink it?

482
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,260
A little bit dripped down.

483
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,380
If he had drunk a bit more, he could have survived.

484
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,340
That's what I mean.

485
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,580
Sometimes that's just how it is.

486
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,780
That's fate.

487
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,900
Okay.

488
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,700
Check his back pocket.

489
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,860
Turn him over.

490
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,780
Pull him out a bit.

491
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,580
Pull the body out a bit.

492
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,100
Could there be something under this carpet?

493
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,380
What's this?

494
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,900
What?

495
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,340
What?

496
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,980
Whose outfit is this?

497
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,380
Girly style.

498
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,700
I know who the culprit is.

499
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,260
It's

500
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,620
Ba Mian Linglong.

501
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,260
Why?

502
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,740
Because I'm wearing green today.

503
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,580
I would never use anything purple-pink.

504
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,940
Me neither, I'm all pink.

505
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,580
No, I think

506
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,820
Look, this looks a lot like yours.

507
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,060
Honestly,

508
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,100
If I put this here, it doesn't stand out at all.

509
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,700
Not out of place at all.

510
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,580
Not out of place at all.

511
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,780
Then let's look for something on the body.

512
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,260
Turn it over.

513
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,700
Today, I just won't.

514
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
Whatever you tell me to do, I won't do it.

515
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,540
Then today,

516
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,660
you're already a suspect.

517
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,780
It's already in my mind.

518
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,340
I don't care if I'm in your mind or not.

519
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,580
Take this off, or give it to him.

520
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,100
There's a phone.

521
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,100
10:04.

522
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,740
There's an unknown number.

523
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,460
A 30-second incoming call.

524
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,340
His heart rate was being monitored on his phone.

525
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,820
His heartbeat stopped at 11:36.

526
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,980
He was officially pronounced dead at 11:36.

527
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,180
11:36.

528
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,100
We were together.

529
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,820
We were taking a poster photo.

530
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,740
Three, two, one.

531
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,980
So the killer

532
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,700
created an alibi.

533
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,100
That's right.

534
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,220
I think we can

535
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,900
search the crime scene.

536
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,100
Okay.

537
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,460
Let's search the crime scene.

538
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,220
We're shooting a commercial.

539
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,780
Don't film me.

540
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,100
I'm about to reveal my true form.

541
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,580
What?

542
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,300
Ice cubes.

543
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,980
Water, ice cubes.

544
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,780
He drank poison.

545
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,740
It was the fake Dudu poison.

546
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,780
How did you figure it out so quickly?

547
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,420
People poisoned by it get Dudu lips.

548
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,180
Look at his lips.

549
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,260
Something's off.

550
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,460
It's colorless and tasteless.

551
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,700
Once it enters the bloodstream, it kills instantly.

552
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,580
So that scar on his face...

553
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,580
How did he drink it?

554
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,100
He had to drink it.

555
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Once it enters the bloodstream, it kills instantly.

556
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,180
So that scar on his face...

557
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,420
What does this puddle of water mean?

558
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,060
It's wet.

559
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,620
I think I know.

560
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,100
He covered his face with this rag beforehand.

561
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,340
He was already poisoned.

562
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,860
But it needs to enter the blood to be fatal.

563
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,020
He put a bowl there and broke it in advance.

564
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,660
He set up a mechanism to make it roll down.

565
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,780
Right, then it cut him.

566
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
Yes.

567
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,460
And once there was blood, it was fatal.

568
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
But there must be some device.

569
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,540
That could make it roll down.

570
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,100
You have to put yourself

571
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,300
in the position of the corpse.

572
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,260
To experience the process.

573
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,300
Go experience this process.

574
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,260
This process.

575
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,540
Yeah, right now I...

576
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,940
really want to slide down.

577
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
If I relax now, I'll roll down.

578
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,300
What pushes him, though?

579
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
I don't believe it. Relax.

580
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,260
You roll.

581
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,780
You roll.

582
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,500
No, it's kind of like that feeling.

583
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,980
You need some kind of force.

584
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,140
to be able to roll down.

585
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,740
So, look for something up here.

586
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,180
I thought you were going to do that.

587
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,740
Push-ups, right?

588
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,380
Yeah.

589
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,700
I thought so too.

590
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,940
Why did he suddenly start doing it here?

591
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
No, he was standing on top of it.

592
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,660
The carpet was pulled.

593
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,780
Or maybe there was some kind of mechanism.

594
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
No, I think I know now.

595
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
It could be ice.

596
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,660
For example, I put it here first.

597
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,380
The ice melted at this time.

598
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,940
Then he rolled down, right?

599
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,500
Would he just lie here waiting for the ice to melt?

600
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,300
He was probably drugged.

601
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,060
Drugged or something like that.

602
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,340
Then it could be this.

603
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,060
The ice melted.

604
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,780
That's why there's so much water.

605
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,420
No, that's it.

606
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,300
Ice.

607
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,340
It should be.

608
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,900
Inside.

609
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,620
Probably. That's so cool.

610
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,260
Then that's it.

611
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,660
That's it.

612
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,140
Case solved.

613
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,180
Right, this is an ice tray.

614
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,900
And then he probably...

615
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,020
For example, let's say...

616
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,340
Whatever, I don't know how he did it.

617
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,740
For example, he put a few ice cubes here.

618
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,940
He can't move now.

619
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,140
Then once the ice melts...

620
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,700
At that moment, he rolls down.

621
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,820
It's possible.

622
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,740
Yeah, it's possible.

623
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,500
The ice acts as a delay.

624
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,340
So he wouldn't die at that time.

625
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,420
Using ice is definitely certain.

626
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,500
It's certain that ice was used.

627
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah.

628
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,700
I don't think ice could hold him back.

629
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,820
Let's keep this question in mind for now.

630
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,220
Come on, let's go check the office.

631
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,220
Someone else is...

632
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,700
What's wrong?

633
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,820
Serious.

634
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,180
What?

635
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,540
The first candidate.

636
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,820
What?

637
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm the designated female lead.

638
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,940
Stop arguing.

639
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,420
You little supporting actor.

640
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,900
And you're putting on airs now, are you?

641
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,820
Of course.

642
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,980
Stop fighting.

643
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,220
Coward

644
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,580
These are our character cards, right?

645
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,620
Come on, everyone draw one yourself.

646
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Just take one, right?

647
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,900
I feel like a coward.

648
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,660
Melancholy ghost, isn't that just me?

649
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,300
Deadly ghost

650
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,020
What does "skin-changing ghost" mean?

651
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,580
Playboy ghost

652
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Handsome ghost

653
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,300
Seriously?

654
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,580
Why can't you take yours out?

655
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
Impossible.

656
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,060
What is it that's so embarrassing?

657
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,460
Today, be X.

658
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,580
That really fits his character today.

659
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,900
Okay.

660
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,460
So many character types.

661
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,380
Alright, let's take them and go.

662
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,580
Let's go check out the office.

663
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,020
I like seeing you frown tightly.

664
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,460
Calling you a coward.

665
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,580
Here we are.

666
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,300
Push for ten billion.

667
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,580
Assistant director

668
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,140
This is the office.

669
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,420
Sorry to bother you.

670
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
So many people.

671
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,460
The Billion Push office also has security.

672
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,100
Alright, everyone, work's over.

673
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,820
Who are you?

674
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
You always hide in the back, don't you?

675
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,660
How is your investigation going?

676
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,980
We more or less have it figured out.

677
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,100
The killer's method.

678
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
But there are still a few unresolved questions.

679
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,020
We need to check his office now.

680
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,940
I have an access card here.

681
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,580
I can give it to you.

682
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,700
Okay.

683
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,380
I can give it to you.

684
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:19,980
Alright, thank you.

685
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,900
But this access card

686
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,180
only works before 10:30.

687
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,060
After 10:30,

688
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,700
as you saw,

689
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
there are two security guards there, right?

690
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
You'll have to find a way in.

691
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,460
Find a way?

692
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,460
What way?

693
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,860
I'll go seduce them.

694
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,420
Move aside, the Push Detective is coming.

695
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,020
Move aside, the Push Detective is coming.

696
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,660
What?

697
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,700
Open the door.

698
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,180
We're both Push Detectives.

699
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,300
I'm a Push Detective.

700
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,300
Big brothers and sisters,

701
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,380
Big brothers and sisters,

702
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,620
I finally get to see you all.

703
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:17,940
What are you doing?

704
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,420
I finally get to see you all.

705
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:18,700
Who is this?

706
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,340
I really love you all.

707
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,180
What are you doing?

708
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,540
Sister.

709
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,740
Sister.

710
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Sasaeng.

711
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,700
I really love you all.

712
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,020
I like you all so, so much.

713
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,540
Come here.

714
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
When did you sneak in?

715
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,220
I don't encourage this.

716
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
How old are you?

717
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,820
I'm already an adult.

718
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,740
It's even more wrong to do this as an adult.

719
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,220
I just like you all.

720
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,380
Like? Do you even know what it means to like someone?

721
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,419
True liking is letting go.

722
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:41,379
But I haven't even had you yet.

723
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,419
Keep a normal (distance).

724
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,540
Have what? Don't even think about having us.

725
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,220
What are you thinking?

726
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,859
What are you up to?

727
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:47,660
Come, let me see.

728
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,859
You’re not still stealing things, are you?

729
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:49,740
Let me take a look.

730
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,580
Come here.

731
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,980
Look, is this yours?

732
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:57,660
That’s not ours.

733
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,180
Outstanding Graduate of 2024

734
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,939
Just now, on the red carpet,

735
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:04,220
I took a lot of photos of you.

736
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,060
Let me see.

737
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,339
Then I couldn’t take any more.

738
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,780
That’s why I came in, to take more photos.

739
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,540
On the red carpet, she—

740
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,740
Did she capture any clues?

741
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,700
She probably did.

742
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,020
Did she really get something?

743
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:17,540
Why are you so—

744
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,820
She definitely doesn’t like me the most.

745
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,419
Let’s go.

746
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:24,419
Why are you dragging me away?

747
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:25,540
I want to stay with my brother and sister.

748
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,100
Give her back her phone.

749
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,820
Give (her) the phone back.

750
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,620
My photos!

751
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,020
Okay, here you go.

752
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,660
Here’s your stuff back.

753
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,100
Delete everything from the phone.

754
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,340
Take her out.

755
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,580
Let’s see if there’s anything else.

756
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,420
Check this supply room.

757
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,300
There’s some fruit.

758
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,820
Eat a banana to get some energy.

759
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,700
Smoke bomb.

760
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,260
Smoke detectors have been installed in this area.

761
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,460
In case of fire,

762
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,420
immediately,

763
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,700
light the smoke bomb.

764
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,140
There are smoke bombs inside.

765
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,460
Come in, come in first.

766
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,300
This is what's going to happen soon.

767
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,180
After we light the smoke bomb,

768
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,820
everyone has to evacuate.

769
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,860
Once they've all run out,

770
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,780
we'll go back in.

771
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,380
Where's the lighter?

772
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,620
It's here.

773
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,980
Hurry, let's create chaos.

774
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,340
Now this job is yours.

775
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,740
Metal bucket.

776
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,540
The metal bucket is over there.

777
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,820
Quick, lift it up.

778
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,420
No, it's too short.

779
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,860
Let it sit for a while.

780
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,940
What's going on?

781
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,100
The alarm went off.

782
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,540
It must be a fire.

783
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,060
Everyone, run! Hurry!

784
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,900
Faster!

785
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,860
Leave in an orderly manner.

786
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,900
Let's go, go.

787
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,260
Go.

788
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,780
We're leaving.

789
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,140
Hurry up.

790
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,980
Let's evacuate too.

791
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,100
Right, there's water over there.

792
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,460
It's easy to knock over.

793
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,700
What's with the ring?

794
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,340
There are so many watches too.

795
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,700
Let's take a watch with us later.

796
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,020
Sure.

797
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,020
Medical record from Tui City First Hospital

798
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,700
Tui Baiyi

799
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,820
Medical history: photosensitive epilepsy

800
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,100
Patients with this condition, when exposed to strong light

801
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,180
will experience five minutes of

802
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,380
unconsciousness

803
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,540
A five-minute period of unconsciousness

804
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,700
Yes, so in daily life, avoid strong light

805
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,580
There's a flashlight

806
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,140
Don't shine it at me

807
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,300
Doesn't he always wear sunglasses?

808
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,820
So that's the five minutes before death

809
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,820
Right

810
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,500
They started taking photos at 11:25, right?

811
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,860
If we were all taking poster photos

812
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,620
or something like that

813
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:53,860
Yeah

814
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,460
then no one would have used the light to flash at him

815
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,100
What kind of outrageous contract is this?

816
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,620
Would anyone actually sign this?

817
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,100
What?

818
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,900
What does that mean?

819
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,740
Look.

820
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,340
Party A has the right to obtain all of Party B's

821
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,700
profits generated from commercial activities.

822
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,980
And according to a ratio of 9.999 for Party A

823
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,940
and 0.001 for Party B.

824
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,700
So if I make ten thousand yuan,

825
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,820
I only get one yuan.

826
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,380
This...

827
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,580
So they're all outrageous contracts.

828
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:24,940
Yeah.

829
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,780
Little killer.

830
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,940
Who's the little killer?

831
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,580
They're all little killers.

832
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,060
Ning Hao.

833
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,340
Ke Daole.

834
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,180
Canary.

835
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,900
At Tuizhen Art Academy.

836
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,580
All three of them have killed someone.

837
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah.

838
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,860
Right.

839
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,780
So the three of us are labeled as little killers.

840
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,700
So he's punishing those who have done wrong.

841
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,020
A blank contract.

842
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,660
What else is there?

843
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,620
There are some notes.

844
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,260
Like puzzle pieces.

845
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,660
Once we figure out these ghosts' identities,

846
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,700
everyone has a name.

847
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,620
The Painted Skin Ghost is very famous.

848
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,820
Tell me, why are you the Painted Skin Ghost?

849
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,540
Because it's cool.

850
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,340
Wait a minute.

851
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,740
He has something on one of us.

852
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,540
What kind of leverage?

853
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,420
These minor things aren't enough to threaten us.

854
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,460
These six rising stars,

855
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,940
We can only write a few character profiles to test them.

856
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,860
But among them,

857
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,220
the one who caused a friend's death,

858
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,420
I've got a firm hold on that person.

859
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,220
The one who caused a friend's death?

860
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,140
Which of us six has ever caused a friend's death?

861
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,580
Is there something special about the phone?

862
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,220
Isn't there a call log?

863
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,940
On his phone,

864
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,660
at 10:04,

865
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,900
there was an incoming call that lasted thirty seconds.

866
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,860
You're sharp.

867
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,420
Voicemail.

868
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,540
You have one

869
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,620
from April 22, 2025,

870
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,980
a voicemail at 9:55.

871
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,260
What?

872
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,500
The billion-dollar director,

873
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,540
the contract you asked me to prepare

874
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,140
is already in the office.

875
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
As long as the secret you have is explosive enough,

876
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,340
the deal will definitely go through.

877
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,740
They'll be under your control for life.

878
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,740
He used someone else's secret

879
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,220
to sign his own contract.

880
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,460
That's right.

881
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,060
There's one

882
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,580
There's a contract without a signature.

883
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
It must be the director.

884
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,700
After threatening this person,

885
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,500
this person had a motive to kill him.

886
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,260
It's not just one.

887
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
There are six.

888
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,260
Prepared for each of us

889
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,060
That means he has leverage on all of us

890
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,980
Right

891
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,740
So the motive for murder is

892
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,780
The director threatened him

893
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,100
Saying if you don't sign this contract

894
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,500
I'll expose your

895
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,620
involvement in your friend's death

896
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,540
So he killed the director

897
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,460
That's possible

898
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,420
So I think we should now

899
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,620
go check our own dressing rooms

900
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,820
to see if there's any

901
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,740
evidence about causing a friend's death

902
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
any facts

903
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
Okay, Detective

904
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,620
Come on, follow me

905
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,500
Everyone

906
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,260
Let's first check

907
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,900
Bamian Linglong's dressing room

908
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,780
Bamian Linglong

909
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,220
Here it is

910
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:00,980
Come on, let's search

911
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,660
There's a suitcase underneath

912
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,380
Really likes crystal slippers

913
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,260
They're all sandals

914
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,580
You make shoes

915
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,460
Bamian Linglong

916
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,500
Where did you get these shoes

917
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,540
June 3rd, 2023

918
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,740
Keban Chushen gave me a lot of crystal shoes

919
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,620
He really likes me

920
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,260
What

921
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,700
He likes you? How did he fall for you

922
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,780
How would I know

923
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,620
I'm just lovable

924
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,300
Sparkling and lovable

925
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,580
He also gave me a lot of colors.

926
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,940
He said I shouldn't wear the same one every day.

927
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,060
I think this way is kind of tacky.

928
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,340
But I also think these shoes look really nice.

929
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,820
So I accepted them.

930
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,220
There's also a phone.

931
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,740
The debt collector sent a text.

932
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,420
July 31, 2020.

933
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,340
You're quite vain.

934
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,980
Just to attend the Tuishi Film Festival,

935
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,380
you couldn't borrow the latest model from any brand.

936
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,980
So you came to us for a loan to buy it outright.

937
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
We gave you half a month.

938
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,060
You had to bring in another person.

939
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,980
Get a one-million loan from Gao Lidi.

940
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,460
That way, your debt would be cleared.

941
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,620
Otherwise, just wait and see.

942
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,900
Then, on August 15th,

943
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,660
Your friend was really difficult. We beat him up.

944
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,580
We also told him he could bring in someone else

945
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,460
to help pay off the debt.

946
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,500
He wouldn't give in, no matter what.

947
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,540
He even ran away.

948
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,020
We waited for him at the foot of the mountain.

949
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,060
But then we saw him actually

950
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,900
fall off the cliff.

951
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,820
You must keep what happened today a secret.

952
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,620
After all, his death

953
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,940
is also connected to you.

954
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,380
If this gets investigated,

955
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,660
you won't get off easy either.

956
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,820
Then Ba replied,

957
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,380
"I'll keep my mouth shut."

958
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,300
You have to keep it secret too.

959
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,300
If this gets out,

960
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,780
my future will be ruined.

961
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,460
What?

962
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,580
You caused your friend's death?

963
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,140
You've caused a friend's death before?

964
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,020
Is she innocent?

965
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,980
Such a beautiful face.

966
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,820
Such an ugly heart.

967
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,700
I was born in 2002.

968
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,540
From 2002.

969
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,180
This year, from 2002.

970
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,100
Yes, in my twenties.

971
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,580
Just over twenty.

972
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,820
I'm so happy.

973
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,700
Then I thought

974
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,900
I've been pretty good-looking since I was little.

975
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,180
People around me all said I was good-looking.

976
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,420
Isn't that right?

977
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,660
So I really wanted to become an artist.

978
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,100
But because my family's financial situation

979
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,140
wasn't good,

980
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,940
not that good,

981
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,740
it wasn't enough for me to go to school

982
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,900
or to have extra money

983
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,980
so I could study art.

984
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,780
I understand.

985
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,100
But because I had some talent,

986
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,580
later on,

987
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,380
I was admitted to the Academy of Arts.

988
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,140
So I came to this school.

989
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,500
But I saw that my friends around me

990
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,220
were all glamorous and came from wealthy families.

991
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,820
But I wasn't.

992
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,140
Then there happened to be an art festival

993
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,300
where I needed to borrow a dress.

994
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,460
That way, I would have the chance

995
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,740
to meet more directors

996
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,260
and more producers.

997
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,060
I could really shine.

998
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,540
That's right.

999
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,540
But since I was just a student

1000
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,500
and not famous,

1001
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,860
they wouldn't rent me a dress.

1002
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,100
Silly.

1003
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,940
You're so beautiful.

1004
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,540
Why do you need to borrow a dress?

1005
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,820
You look good in anything.

1006
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,500
How could you...

1007
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,740
No, this is a big event.

1008
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,020
You have to respect the people attending.

1009
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,740
So I used this Gaolidai to borrow money.

1010
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,780
And I borrowed two hundred thousand.

1011
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,900
But before half a month had passed,

1012
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,020
he told me to pay back five hundred thousand.

1013
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,340
He said the interest had already reached three hundred thousand.

1014
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,340
But because I didn't have any money,

1015
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,220
then this boss

1016
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,580
sent me this message.

1017
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,300
He said he would reveal my secret to every school.

1018
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,100
He wanted everyone to know.

1019
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,780
That way, I would have no way

1020
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,740
to continue being an entertainer.

1021
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,580
Yes.

1022
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,300
Then I got really scared.

1023
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,660
So I followed his instructions

1024
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,780
and went

1025
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,380
to Chaojue.

1026
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,700
I unintentionally revealed some of my

1027
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,300
wealth.

1028
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,660
To one of my friends,

1029
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,660
I told him that recently

1030
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,580
I had found a way

1031
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,700
to make money.

1032
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,380
Then I

1033
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,380
tricked my friend into going over.

1034
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,260
He also borrowed money from someone.

1035
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
And the interest kept piling up.

1036
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,740
The boss also sent him a message.

1037
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,380
He told him to find someone else too.

1038
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:11,860
I understand.

1039
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,060
But because he

1040
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,660
really didn't want to drag anyone else in,

1041
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,260
he later

1042
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:16,780
ran away.

1043
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,020
Then the boss said

1044
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,420
he was waiting for him at the bottom of the mountain.

1045
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,900
No matter what, he would be able to intercept him.

1046
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,660
Unexpectedly, from that mountain,

1047
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,500
he accidentally rolled down

1048
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,300
and died from the fall.

1049
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,220
It's okay.

1050
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,620
You really don't need to blame yourself.

1051
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,100
Everyone has their own fate.

1052
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,860
That was his fate.

1053
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,300
There's nothing you can do.

1054
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,820
What, are you foreshadowing that you'll hurt your friends later?

1055
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,700
Setting it up, right?

1056
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,900
You can't escape either.

1057
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,180
You can't escape either.

1058
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,820
No, it's because I'm her assistant.

1059
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,700
Why?

1060
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,420
He volunteered himself.

1061
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,340
He wanted to be my assistant.

1062
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,340
He was already your assistant at school?

1063
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:51,860
Yes.

1064
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,860
Yes, on September 20, 2020.

1065
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,860
That was when school started.

1066
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,540
Then I became friends with someone from the Arts Management Department.

1067
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,100
Ning Que Wu Lan.

1068
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,020
We became good friends.

1069
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,140
Then he said he could be my assistant.

1070
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,460
He was willing to do anything for me.

1071
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,060
Yes.

1072
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,140
Don't you think that's strange?

1073
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,300
He said that to you?

1074
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,500
I think it's not that unusual for guys to treat me like that.

1075
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,660
You're used to it, huh?

1076
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:09,860
I'm used to it.

1077
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,300
That's true.

1078
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,660
I've never experienced that.

1079
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,220
Alright, let's look at Jin's.

1080
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,140
Just say it.

1081
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,380
Who did you kill?

1082
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,700
Confess yourself.

1083
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,180
What?

1084
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,580
Who did you get killed?

1085
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,300
Go ahead, take a look.

1086
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,660
Here's a phone.

1087
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,180
Golden reputation.

1088
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,060
Which one do you want to talk about first?

1089
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,580
This is a driver's license.

1090
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,060
It says "Golden Reputation, Female" on it.

1091
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,300
But there's blood on it.

1092
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,820
There's another one.

1093
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,220
This is "Golden Reputation."

1094
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,380
A photo with someone from the Koban background.

1095
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,020
It says "First Love" under this photo.

1096
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,020
First love.

1097
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,260
First love.

1098
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,420
Do you know what first love means to someone?

1099
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,740
How important it is?

1100
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,700
It's like a knife.

1101
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,500
Ke Wuku.

1102
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,820
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

1103
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,540
Stop being jealous, okay?

1104
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,340
Who can guess the password for this box?

1105
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,100
I can't guess it.

1106
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,220
Let me give you a hint.

1107
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,100
The end of May.

1108
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,820
You're a Taurus.

1109
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,740
Hurry up and unlock it.

1110
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,980
Let me do it.

1111
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,140
What's the password? Answer me.

1112
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,100
The password is just a random four-digit number.

1113
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,700
Say it.

1114
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,020
My birthday.

1115
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,300
It's open.

1116
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,740
This man.

1117
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,860
Took your glass slipper.

1118
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,820
Koban, oh Koban.

1119
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,860
Koban background.

1120
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,100
Why is my box's password your birthday?

1121
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,740
You tell me.

1122
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,420
The first time.

1123
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,500
I don't want to tell my own story myself.

1124
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,940
I want you to tell it.

1125
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,780
I once chased fame and fortune.

1126
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,300
He only gave you one pair.

1127
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,140
And you even locked them up with a password.

1128
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,980
Look at this.

1129
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,340
Don’t you know his family sells plastic slippers?

1130
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,060
He gives out boxes of them, but you only got one pair.

1131
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,420
I wear these crystal shoes every day.

1132
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,980
I wear them in summer, I even wear them in winter.

1133
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,940
In winter,

1134
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,820
I treat them like a treasure.

1135
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,740
What about you?

1136
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,300
The first time you saw me,

1137
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,020
you said, "You’re so beautiful."

1138
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,340
The nine moles on your face,

1139
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,420
I wanted to touch every single one.

1140
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,460
I said okay, I’d give you that chance.

1141
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,740
And then?

1142
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,300
I almost twisted my ankle.

1143
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,220
Slow down.

1144
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,500
It really hurt.

1145
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,420
At first, he was the one chasing after you.

1146
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,020
Yes.

1147
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,980
He was pursuing me.

1148
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,500
And then I...

1149
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,740
I settled and got together with him.

1150
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:44,900
I settled and got together with him.

1151
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,540
You could feel it.

1152
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,820
He was reaching above his level, yes.

1153
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,140
Yes.

1154
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,740
Yes.

1155
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,380
But later, for some reason, he just...

1156
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
But later, for some reason, he just...

1157
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,660
He just ignored me.

1158
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,420
But I loved him very, very much.

1159
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,940
Because he wasn't just my secret crush.

1160
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,220
He was my love.

1161
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,460
You even wrote a song for me.

1162
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,260
And that song could only be...

1163
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,780
listened to if you paid for it.

1164
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,020
I searched like crazy for it on QQ Music.

1165
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,380
But I couldn't find it.

1166
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,540
Just like your true feelings—I couldn't find them.

1167
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
After I got together with him,

1168
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,860
I couldn't say

1169
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,020
that I was with him.

1170
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,460
Because I didn't know

1171
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,660
if people would understand me.

1172
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,140
Because I am...

1173
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,140
Understand, this kind of understanding.

1174
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,940
I get it.

1175
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,940
You're about to become famous.

1176
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,580
Yes.

1177
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,260
And then one day,

1178
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,860
he became very distant from me.

1179
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,340
Weren't you the one who distanced yourself first?

1180
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,420
He was the one who distanced himself from me.

1181
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,580
Later, I asked a friend of mine.

1182
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,260
Later, I asked a friend of mine.

1183
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,500
His name is Ning Que Wu Lan.

1184
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,180
He said that's not real affection.

1185
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,660
I saw that it's better to have nothing than to settle.

1186
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,100
Ba Mian Linglong is so wonderful.

1187
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,820
I'm good.

1188
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,780
I'm so envious.

1189
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,100
Yeah, I also want someone like that.

1190
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,700
Someone who cares for and looks after me.

1191
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,820
So later you liked Ning Que Wu Lan again?

1192
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,140
I didn't.

1193
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,020
I didn't really fall for him.

1194
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,740
Maybe I was just a bit greedy.

1195
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,260
A little greedy.

1196
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,380
Then I made a piece of clothing.

1197
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,860
On a Valentine's Day.

1198
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,300
I made two of that piece.

1199
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,420
One for my best friend.

1200
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,540
One for the boy I loved most.

1201
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,900
Okay.

1202
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,940
Listen to what she said.

1203
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,220
Is there a problem with that?

1204
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,180
Can't men and women have pure friendship?

1205
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,260
They can.

1206
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,900
We are, aren't we?

1207
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,860
Yeah.

1208
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,420
Later, he said he wanted to break up with me.

1209
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,620
I told him not to break up with me.

1210
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,020
I told him not to break up with me.

1211
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,620
Don't break up with me.

1212
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,020
Then it seemed like at some

1213
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,820
occasion like this,

1214
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,020
right in front of me,

1215
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,940
he confessed to another woman.

1216
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,660
He did it to upset me on purpose.

1217
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,140
You're nothing more than

1218
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,100
a tool he used to make me angry.

1219
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,060
What are you so proud of?

1220
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,820
Go ahead, keep laughing.

1221
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,140
You even turned him down.

1222
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,300
Do you think that by rejecting him

1223
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,900
I'll look like a clown?

1224
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,580
Yes.

1225
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,780
I'm not angry at all.

1226
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,700
I really don't care.

1227
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,060
It's obvious.

1228
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,340
Very calm.

1229
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,340
I really don't care.

1230
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,340
(clenches fist)

1231
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,660
That's all.

1232
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,300
Alright, then

1233
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,340
let's look at this phone.

1234
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:21,980
WeChat.

1235
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,500
The first person is called

1236
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,380
Senior Resource 190.

1237
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,780
March 20, 2024.

1238
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,420
Junior, are you free tomorrow night?

1239
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,660
I have a pretty good script here.

1240
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,020
I'd like to invite you to play the female lead.

1241
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,900
And have dinner together as well.

1242
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,340
Senior, do you trust me that much?

1243
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,060
I'm just a newcomer, after all.

1244
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,220
Your three-minute cameo in the new show

1245
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,460
already moved me to tears.

1246
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,700
I believe that in the future,

1247
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,180
you'll definitely win an Oscar.

1248
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,180
Best Actress.

1249
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,100
Senior, you're such a sweet talker.

1250
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,620
Then tomorrow, I'll accompany you, my fan,

1251
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,740
and have dinner with you.

1252
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,540
Listen,

1253
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,580
there's another one.

1254
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,260
185, eight-pack abs.

1255
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,340
My golden circle princess,

1256
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,740
want to go to the gym together this weekend?

1257
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,980
Are your biceps

1258
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,500
bigger than those from the Koban school?

1259
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,300
Do your eight-pack abs

1260
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,860
meet the Koban standard?

1261
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,700
Of course.

1262
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,260
Then he sent two muscle photos.

1263
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,700
Let me see.

1264
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,140
That hurts.

1265
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,300
Ke, did you break up with her?

1266
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,140
Good job breaking up.

1267
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,100
Yeah.

1268
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,020
And there's also a clingy little brother who's 1.87 meters tall.

1269
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,700
Sis, you haven't contacted me for days.

1270
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,980
Sis, you need to take care of your health.

1271
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,460
Otherwise, your little brother will feel bad.

1272
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,340
Alright, since you're so considerate,

1273
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,740
I'll reluctantly agree.

1274
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,660
But can you sing

1275
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,740
"Crush or love" for me?

1276
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,380
Let me hear who sings better, you or Ke from the same class.

1277
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,420
Who sings it better?

1278
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,020
To be honest,

1279
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,820
today is also my first time

1280
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,020
seeing these things.

1281
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,100
This was in 2024,

1282
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,700
we had already broken up.

1283
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,460
Yes, but this

1284
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,020
is the reason we broke up.

1285
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,820
Because you acted like this with other guys before.

1286
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,580
I wasn't like this before.

1287
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,180
I was as pure as a little white rabbit.

1288
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,260
Alright, next I want to ask you

1289
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,260
about this bloodstained driver's license.

1290
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,020
What does it mean?

1291
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,020
Who did you kill?

1292
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,100
Here's what happened.

1293
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,660
I always said I wanted to get into Tuiyi University.

1294
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,700
At that time, the college entrance exam was coming up.

1295
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,140
Then I met a friend online.

1296
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,620
I called him my "golden friend."

1297
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,620
We chatted online.

1298
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,700
We promised each other we'd get into college.

1299
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,300
Later, the day I got in,

1300
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,220
my dad bought me a luxury car

1301
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,460
to celebrate.

1302
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,860
So I took my golden friend up the mountain

1303
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,420
for a drive, to have some fun.

1304
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,140
You know that kind of

1305
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,260
really glamorous lifestyle.

1306
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,420
Cruising around, right?

1307
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,700
At first, I was very careful.

1308
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,140
But then I started driving more boldly.

1309
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,260
Because I felt like

1310
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,820
Then suddenly, someone rushed out.

1311
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,420
There was a bang as we collided.

1312
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,020
I passed out right away.

1313
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,940
You hit someone and then you passed out?

1314
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,940
Yes, I tried to brake suddenly.

1315
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,540
Then my head hit something.

1316
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,660
When I woke up again,

1317
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,580
the car was stopped halfway on a cliff.

1318
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,380
What was I supposed to do at that moment?

1319
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,220
All I could do was run.

1320
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,060
When I got out,

1321
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,460
I...

1322
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,300
I heard someone inside calling for help.

1323
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,860
But I didn't have time to react.

1324
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,540
Then the car fell.

1325
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,260
If I tried to save him,

1326
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,660
I think I would have been in danger too.

1327
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,300
Do you agree?

1328
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,420
Does everyone agree or not?

1329
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,980
This situation was dangerous.

1330
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,540
But...

1331
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,580
I think it's like this.

1332
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,660
In such a dangerous moment,

1333
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,940
we shouldn't allow moral coercion.

1334
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,020
Right.

1335
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:41,900
Yes.

1336
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,260
Do you like me?

1337
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,060
She caused her friend's death, right?

1338
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,300
Does that count as me causing it?

1339
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,500
You were the driver.

1340
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,900
Reckless driving, that's the first point.

1341
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,460
Right.

1342
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:55,780
Yes.

1343
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,260
Wait a minute.

1344
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,140
Everyone here can criticize me.

1345
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,220
But you can't.

1346
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,380
You can only kiss me.

1347
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,940
That's indirect manslaughter.

1348
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,740
It's actually a bit direct.

1349
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,180
Right.

1350
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,140
I just want to say

1351
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,300
no one's hands are cleaner than mine.

1352
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,180
If you've never committed a crime,

1353
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,540
then throw a stone from the ground at my face.

1354
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,340
Okay.

1355
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,260
Next.

1356
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,820
Come on, let's see Keke.

1357
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,100
Come on, Kewuku.

1358
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,220
There's this here, press me.

1359
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,380
Press it.

1360
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,100
Press.

1361
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,140
Flashlight.

1362
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,260
Shine this with it, yes.

1363
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,420
A keepsake, not to be worn outside.

1364
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,220
It's your profile picture.

1365
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,220
Isn't this the shirt I gave you?

1366
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,460
She's the best.

1367
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,020
Who's the best?

1368
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,420
And you say it's me.

1369
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,820
Why do you still have

1370
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,540
a photo of Bamian Linglong on here?

1371
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,100
That was close, the sky almost fell.

1372
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,420
I just have it.

1373
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,580
Right, didn't he give you shoes too?

1374
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,660
Did he give her shoes too?

1375
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,340
He only gave you one pair.

1376
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,460
And you even locked it with a password.

1377
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:49,940
There's also a phone.

1378
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,700
So cute.

1379
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,460
Jinzi Zhaopai said, "Brother,"

1380
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,740
I recently had a custom outfit made

1381
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,740
that would really suit you.

1382
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,060
I'll send it to you, just send me your address.

1383
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,340
And then this—

1384
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,180
Okay, okay, okay.

1385
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,340
Tiebushan Summit, Tiebu Community

1386
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,340
Building 1, Room 101

1387
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,820
Who is "Okay, okay, okay"?

1388
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,340
Super unbelievably handsome.

1389
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,700
Remember to take a photo.

1390
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,380
Remember to send me a photo back.

1391
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,820
I also gave one to my boyfriend.

1392
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,700
Isn't that you?

1393
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,540
I only made two of those outfits.

1394
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,740
One for my best friend,

1395
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,820
and one for the guy I love most.

1396
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,180
So, quality over quantity.

1397
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,220
So "Okay, okay, okay" is the one, right?

1398
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,460
Then "Okay, okay, okay" replied,

1399
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,340
saying, "It's one thing for you to give him a gift,"

1400
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,500
"but you even keep it a secret and don't make it public."

1401
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,820
"Even I don't know who he is."

1402
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,820
A secret relationship, you know?

1403
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,100
Brother

1404
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,220
My broken heart has been mended again

1405
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,660
A handsome college guy went shopping with me

1406
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,900
So you’re hiding it from one person

1407
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,980
And dating the other person

1408
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,820
I’m not! He’s just my brother

1409
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,780
No, we’re just best friends

1410
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,300
These chat logs don’t look like just friends

1411
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,700
Of course

1412
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,740
We’re just pure friends

1413
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,540
Pure “besties”

1414
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,260
I’m her “bestie”

1415
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,660
Yeah

1416
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,500
Tell me, bro

1417
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,580
Do you think this counts as just friends?

1418
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:16,460
Could you accept this?

1419
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,220
Honestly

1420
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,820
If your girlfriend

1421
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,300
You saw her talking to someone else like this

1422
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,180
You wouldn’t be able to take it

1423
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,860
Of course I couldn’t take it

1424
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,260
I call him brother

1425
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,500
Of course I couldn’t take it

1426
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,420
Why are you so petty?

1427
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,940
You look so generous

1428
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,860
Could you accept it?

1429
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,660
Could you accept it?

1430
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,980
Sis, you’ve already forgotten the pain after healing, huh?

1431
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,340
Still not breaking up with that jerk?

1432
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,460
A fickle woman

1433
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,460
Seriously

1434
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,380
If you give me another flower, I’ll point at you too

1435
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,460
Ke Wuku

1436
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,300
You should confess on your own.

1437
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,140
I started school in 2020.

1438
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,260
In 2023, I fell in love at first sight.

1439
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,300
Then I confessed my feelings to her.

1440
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,500
After that, the two of us

1441
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,780
happily got together.

1442
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,900
Not long after, she told me

1443
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,500
that someone close to her told her

1444
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,340
that I wasn't a good boyfriend.

1445
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,620
She said she should break up with me.

1446
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,980
Until one day,

1447
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,300
I saw her

1448
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,180
phone.

1449
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,060
Why did you look at my phone?

1450
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,380
That really was my fault.

1451
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,700
But

1452
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,740
Anyway, I found some chat logs.

1453
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,460
After I saw them,

1454
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,980
I was really upset.

1455
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,300
Then tell me,

1456
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,180
why are you giving me the silent treatment?

1457
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,420
You were the one who was being flirtatious first.

1458
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,900
You manipulate him every day.

1459
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,180
And you manipulate me too.

1460
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,380
Then you ask me,

1461
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,740
why don't you ever ask me anything?

1462
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,780
I talk to you every day.

1463
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,780
Why do you always look so cold?

1464
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,100
Wait, why are you taking her side?

1465
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,500
I'm her best friend.

1466
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,980
He's just like a brother.

1467
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,660
We're girls, you're a boy.

1468
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,660
You should take the initiative.

1469
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,860
We're girls.

1470
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,580
You're a girl.

1471
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:00,980
We're just young girls.

1472
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,180
You're a boy, you should make the first move.

1473
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:02,660
No.

1474
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,900
You're the last person who should be standing here.

1475
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,260
saying these things to me, okay?

1476
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,580
The rift between us

1477
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,660
is because of you.

1478
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
Can you two get back together?

1479
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,420
It really hurts.

1480
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:24,900
Clenched fist.

1481
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,500
Anyway,

1482
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,380
after this happened,

1483
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,900
I found a good friend of mine,

1484
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,980
named Ke.

1485
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,020
I told him there was a guy

1486
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,180
who's been meddling

1487
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,260
in things between me and my girlfriend lately.

1488
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,500
I asked if he could

1489
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,300
come with me to scare him a bit.

1490
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,540
And because earlier

1491
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,580
there was an address in the chat history,

1492
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,740
I followed that address.

1493
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,940
Okay.

1494
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,260
Hidden so well.

1495
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,300
If it’s not well hidden, how can it be called a secret?

1496
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,220
USB drive.

1497
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,540
Alright.

1498
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,740
What's inside this?

1499
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,700
Um...

1500
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,580
Just plug the USB drive into the computer and you'll know.

1501
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,180
There are computers everywhere outside.

1502
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:17,780
Come on.

1503
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Let's see what's inside.

1504
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,740
Let's go.

1505
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,060
This is something really scary.

1506
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,060
A secret that absolutely can't be discovered.

1507
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,860
Open it.

1508
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,580
Three.

1509
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:45,500
Two.

1510
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,580
One.

1511
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,140
Why isn't anyone scared?

1512
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,540
Who is this?

1513
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,580
Someone dragged a person away.

1514
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,260
Those two are arguing.

1515
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:03,940
They're fighting.

1516
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,980
They're fighting—someone's trying to break it up.

1517
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,780
That guy fought back, right?

1518
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,620
He fought back—one against two.

1519
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,340
Pushed down the mountain.

1520
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,660
His friend was killed.

1521
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,140
You pushed your friend down.

1522
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,100
Both of them fell down.

1523
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,580
It was my friend and that guy.

1524
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,700
The person I was going to scare.

1525
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,940
The two of them fell down.

1526
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,300
Didn't you ask him to come out?

1527
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,380
Yes, that's what I wanted to say.

1528
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,260
That's it.

1529
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,380
You've been telling me all along.

1530
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,700
This "alright, alright, alright" is him, right?

1531
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,420
So now that person...

1532
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,140
If we assume it's you,

1533
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,500
You're still alive, how is that possible?

1534
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,500
That's right.

1535
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:52,980
I came back today

1536
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,140
to take your life.

1537
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,020
Didn't you see how ghostly I'm dressed?

1538
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,100
I'm that dead guy.

1539
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,700
The last one is the most exciting.

1540
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,900
Being picky is definitely intense.

1541
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,420
You're the center of the storm.

1542
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,860
"Alright, alright, alright," right?

1543
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:26,780
You keep telling her to break up every day.

1544
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,540
What's your real intention?

1545
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,380
Now I know where you live.

1546
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:32,860
Just wait.

1547
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,780
I'll bring people to your place in an hour to deal with you.

1548
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,620
If you're a man, don't run.

1549
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,220
If you dare run once,

1550
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,140
I'll come beat you up ten times a day from now on.

1551
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,300
You talk big.

1552
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,540
You're not even the one hitting, you just stand by and watch.

1553
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,380
So he really did send the message to you.

1554
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,940
You are, you really are.

1555
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,820
That "alright, alright, alright" guy.

1556
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,780
So many things.

1557
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,060
What?

1558
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,260
I like you.

1559
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,140
So that's how it is.

1560
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,580
Aren't we friends?

1561
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,740
Aren't we friends?

1562
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,980
You've been by my side for so many years as a friend.

1563
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,380
Listen to Baba.

1564
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,620
Listen to what Baba says.

1565
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,820
Don't let her get hurt.

1566
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:31,860
Let me try once.

1567
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,140
Listen to what Baba says.

1568
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:42,020
Don't let her get hurt.

1569
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,620
Whatever Baba says goes.

1570
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,460
Take good care of her.

1571
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,300
Protect her.

1572
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,860
It has that folk song vibe.

1573
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,860
Yes.

1574
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,740
From the northeast.

1575
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,780
This is all her, too.

1576
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,060
Really.

1577
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,540
In his eyes, it's all about her.

1578
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,460
Baby.

1579
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,860
All I see, all I feel,

1580
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,300
is that what you long for but can't have is the hardest to let go.

1581
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,420
If I say I truly love you,

1582
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,140
who will mend the friendships that get broken?

1583
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,340
This box holds my lonely secrets.

1584
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,540
Loving you is a lonely secret.

1585
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,860
So romantic.

1586
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,140
I'm her assistant.

1587
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,300
And sometimes, when it rains,

1588
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:30,940
I hold an umbrella for her.

1589
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,100
But at that moment, I just

1590
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,900
I can hold a bit of it too.

1591
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,860
This is the umbrella we used together.

1592
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,300
I can hold a bit of it too.

1593
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,620
So when we share the umbrella,

1594
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,940
you can stand very close together.

1595
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,100
Yes, that's right.

1596
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,140
After that, I started looking forward to rainy days.

1597
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,179
Not me, it's him.

1598
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:47,820
Yes.

1599
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,460
You rascal.

1600
01:08:56,179 --> 01:08:57,139
There's also a key here.

1601
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:15,139
This shirt

1602
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,540
looks great on you.

1603
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,340
That's because people are looking at her face,

1604
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,500
not the shirt.

1605
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,139
And my face

1606
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:30,940
makes her face look even better.

1607
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,300
Right.

1608
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,500
It's open.

1609
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,340
Sorry.

1610
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,139
But I can't let anyone know about this.

1611
01:09:50,139 --> 01:09:51,099
Otherwise, I won't be able

1612
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:52,900
to stay by her side.

1613
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:08,900
It's the little yellow hat, the one from before.

1614
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,700
Little yellow hat.

1615
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,139
He had Little Yellow Hat take his place.

1616
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:21,780
That's how it was.

1617
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,340
I also got admitted in 2020

1618
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,780
to our Performing Arts program.

1619
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:25,580
On the first day of school,

1620
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,940
I saw

1621
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,220
a very, very beautiful girl on the playground.

1622
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,220
I fell in love with her at first sight.

1623
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,060
I developed feelings for her.

1624
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,900
But I was afraid

1625
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,660
of being rejected.

1626
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,300
So I worked by her side as an assistant.

1627
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,500
I stayed close to her.

1628
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,340
One day,

1629
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,260
I suddenly got a message.

1630
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,180
Her boyfriend—

1631
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:48,620
her boyfriend

1632
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:49,940
was coming to beat me up.

1633
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,620
How pathetic.

1634
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,940
That tall guy said

1635
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:55,540
he was going to beat me up.

1636
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,620
Now that's a coward.

1637
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,460
What did I ever do to deserve this?

1638
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,940
I'm just a male best friend.

1639
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,900
I'm just a male best friend.

1640
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,700
So at that moment,

1641
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,340
I just...

1642
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,660
I sent your good friend.

1643
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,500
That's right, called Ning Friend.

1644
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,420
Anyway, your boyfriend doesn't know me.

1645
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,100
So I invited this friend over.

1646
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:17,940
I went to watch a movie.

1647
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,540
After I came back from the movie,

1648
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,580
I found my door had been broken open.

1649
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,140
I figured it must have been your boyfriend.

1650
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,140
Your boyfriend came.

1651
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,140
So I started looking everywhere.

1652
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,460
Right at our door,

1653
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,500
there was an old man out for a walk.

1654
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,860
I asked him if he had seen

1655
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,020
my friend

1656
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,780
or a group of people fighting.

1657
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,860
He said he saw some people fighting.

1658
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,260
It looked like they fought all the way to

1659
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,700
the edge of the Tiebu Mountain cliff.

1660
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,540
So I ran to the edge of the cliff to check.

1661
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,620
There was no one there.

1662
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,020
Then I ran to the bottom of the cliff.

1663
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,940
I found a broken phone.

1664
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:52,860
It was my friend's phone.

1665
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,140
He's the one with the little yellow hat.

1666
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,340
Wait, so you

1667
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,580
only found the phone at the bottom of the cliff?

1668
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,020
You didn't see anyone?

1669
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,180
No.

1670
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,220
These little secrets

1671
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,860
aren't enough to threaten these six

1672
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,260
rising stars.

1673
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,660
So they must have been taken away by Baiyi.

1674
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,580
You mean Baiyi was down there

1675
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,860
and rescued those people?

1676
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,940
He saved all our friends.

1677
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,060
He was so busy that night.

1678
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,140
He saved so many people.

1679
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,780
Was it the same day for us?

1680
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,820
Mine was August 15th.

1681
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,820
Mine was August 15th too.

1682
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,460
You two, on the same day

1683
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,100
I hit your friend

1684
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:49,340
I hit your friend

1685
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,060
Yes

1686
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,980
It was the two of us working together

1687
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,260
who caused your friend's death

1688
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,220
The two of you worked together

1689
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:56,420
to harm your own friend

1690
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,500
to harm your own friend

1691
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,140
and killed them together

1692
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,540
That's right

1693
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,860
Now it's all clear

1694
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,060
Everyone has been discovered by the billionaire boss

1695
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,580
who found out they committed murder

1696
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,140
and is possibly holding this murder over them

1697
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:11,540
Yes

1698
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,860
No one's hands are clean

1699
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,820
Everyone has killed their own friend

1700
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,740
So anyone could be threatened by the billionaire

1701
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,700
And then

1702
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,140
commit murder

1703
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,260
Yes

1704
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,740
Let's summarize.

1705
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,300
Go ahead.

1706
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,740
Let's have a summary discussion.

1707
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,500
Okay.

1708
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,220
I think we should first determine his time of death

1709
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,380
and the possible time of the crime.

1710
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,900
Let's identify that time frame first.

1711
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,380
Time of death.

1712
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,540
Wasn't it 11:36?

1713
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,460
That's right, 11:36.

1714
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,740
And there was a five-minute period of unconsciousness.

1715
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,340
Wasn't there a strong light shining

1716
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,740
into his eyes?

1717
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,500
I remember there's a lamp in our props room.

1718
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,460
Don't shine it at me.

1719
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,580
So he lost consciousness at 11:31.

1720
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,220
At that time,

1721
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,140
everyone should have been

1722
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,860
taking poster photos and doing group interviews.

1723
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,220
Right.

1724
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:10,940
If we were all taking poster photos

1725
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,740
or something like that,

1726
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:11,980
Right.

1727
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,660
then no one could have used the lamp to flash him.

1728
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,820
Let's go over the timeline.

1729
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,860
Let's start from the very beginning.

1730
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,340
We saw Tui Baiyi.

1731
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,980
Red carpet at 10:30, right.

1732
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,860
Free time at 11:00.

1733
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,580
Everyone returned to their own lounge.

1734
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:31,900
Right.

1735
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,180
Then at 11:25

1736
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,180
we started taking photos, right?

1737
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:34,940
So from 11:00

1738
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:35,940
to 11:25,

1739
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,060
what was everyone doing?

1740
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,820
I'm helping Ba.

1741
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,700
find a location to shoot a rustic-style video.

1742
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,180
So you could be anywhere in this place.

1743
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:47,860
You could show up anywhere.

1744
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,020
Then you found that storage room.

1745
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,580
And then you wanted to kill someone, right?

1746
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,820
That means there was no one

1747
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,420
who could vouch for you, right?

1748
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,500
Okay, Jin.

1749
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,260
Who? Jin?

1750
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,860
I... I had diarrhea.

1751
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,580
You were in there for twenty-five minutes?

1752
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,140
You spent the whole time in the bathroom?

1753
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,140
Yes, in the restroom.

1754
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,380
I kept going. Can't it last twenty-five minutes?

1755
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,060
Ba.

1756
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,460
I was really hungry at the time.

1757
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,140
So I went to the supply room.

1758
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,220
The place where the snacks are kept.

1759
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,580
I ate for twenty-five minutes.

1760
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,140
Ke.

1761
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,460
I was touching up my makeup in the break room.

1762
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,340
Then at 11:25,

1763
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,660
the six of us gathered together.

1764
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,620
Then we went to

1765
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,380
take photos

1766
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,420
and do interviews.

1767
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,900
During that time, all six of us were together.

1768
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,220
So it could only be during this

1769
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,140
period of time

1770
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,820
that the crime could have happened.

1771
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,500
That's right.

1772
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,180
The unconsciousness lasted five minutes.

1773
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,060
Five minutes.

1774
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:46,980
Exposed to strong light.

1775
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,100
Then he died.

1776
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,020
That's a pretty impressive method.

1777
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,700
If he wants to extend this time,

1778
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,300
then when he wakes up, shake him a bit.

1779
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,980
Shake him when he wakes up.

1780
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,900
Shake him when he wakes up.

1781
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,980
Just keep him under control.

1782
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,180
It's not impossible.

1783
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,500
No, wouldn't that be even harder?

1784
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,140
It's already hard to shake him once.

1785
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,260
If you keep shaking for five minutes, you can extend the time.

1786
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,060
Overnight package.

1787
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,260
Add five yuan for a little extra time.

1788
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,540
Just woke up.

1789
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,700
I think this person

1790
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,940
must know him very well.

1791
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,740
Otherwise, how would they know he has this illness?

1792
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,180
This person must have been to his office.

1793
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,340
Diagnosis report.

1794
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,660
The medical records are there.

1795
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,220
Right.

1796
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,460
If it's about the office, it's you again, darling.

1797
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,020
It's very close to the boss's office.

1798
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,300
Can't get into the office.

1799
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,180
Look, after ten o'clock

1800
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,300
there's someone guarding his office.

1801
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,260
After ten thirty

1802
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,820
you also saw there are two security guards there.

1803
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,620
Right?

1804
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,900
You have to find a way to get in.

1805
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,220
Yeah, how do I get in?

1806
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,260
I don't even have a card.

1807
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,780
What time was the contract placed in his office?

1808
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,700
April 22nd, 9:55.

1809
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,740
April 22nd.

1810
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,380
A voicemail at 9:55.

1811
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,740
The billionaire director.

1812
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,180
The contract you asked me to prepare

1813
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,780
has already been placed in the office.

1814
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,260
As long as the secret you have is explosive enough,

1815
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,060
the deal will definitely go through.

1816
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,740
He could be under your control for life.

1817
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,100
It must be this director.

1818
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,500
After threatening this person,

1819
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,420
this person had a motive to kill him.

1820
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,980
That means the killer

1821
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,700
at 9:55

1822
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,380
was probably right in that office

1823
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,340
and heard that voicemail.

1824
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,100
That paper was torn off after 9:55.

1825
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:24,980
It was torn off.

1826
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:27,700
Right.

1827
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,060
Seeing this thing at 9:55

1828
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,020
actually triggered the motive for murder.

1829
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,060
It's a turning point, isn't it?

1830
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:33,820
Yes.

1831
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,860
So before 9:55,

1832
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,940
he actually shouldn't have

1833
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,980
wanted to kill this person.

1834
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,060
He shouldn't have wanted to kill.

1835
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:40,860
So why would he

1836
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:41,860
specifically go to this person's office?

1837
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,260
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

1838
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,540
Maybe he overheard something at the bathroom door.

1839
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,220
Maybe that bathroom

1840
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,460
is connected.

1841
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,180
That could be possible.

1842
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,620
Or maybe it wasn't handled well at all.

1843
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,660
True.

1844
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,860
Don't talk about my artist like that.

1845
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,580
What she said makes sense.

1846
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,060
You just happened to have diarrhea in the bathroom.

1847
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,140
Don't say that.

1848
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,420
Through the flushing pipes,

1849
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,460
you could listen while going.

1850
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,060
What kind of sounds?

1851
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,580
There are a lot of pipes in the bathroom.

1852
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,900
The pipes are very sensitive.

1853
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,420
Right.

1854
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:15,700
Isn't that so?

1855
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:21,500
I was from eleven to eleven twenty-five

1856
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,860
having diarrhea.

1857
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,540
Yes, that's true.

1858
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,820
Then there's a possibility that

1859
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:28,380
this person

1860
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,860
went to the office before ten o'clock.

1861
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,580
It's that simple.

1862
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:31,820
Yes.

1863
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:32,700
I know.

1864
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,220
It has to be before the red carpet starts.

1865
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,540
Our time

1866
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,540
is from nine thirty to ten thirty.

1867
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,300
During this time, everyone is free.

1868
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,580
We were doing hair and makeup.

1869
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:42,780
Yes.

1870
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:43,700
Yes, all of us were here doing hair and makeup.

1871
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,740
So you can all vouch for each other.

1872
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,980
No, because the curtain was drawn.

1873
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,220
This is my first time meeting him.

1874
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,260
I was already chosen by him.

1875
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,820
He personally selected me as the actress.

1876
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,300
Then you’re the most likely to have entered his office.

1877
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,780
But I was invited here by him.

1878
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,540
That means he trusts you a lot.

1879
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,140
You must go into his office quite often.

1880
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,780
No.

1881
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,180
I hadn’t met him before.

1882
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,460
Never met him.

1883
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,140
First time working together and—

1884
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:12,900
He picked you as the lead actress.

1885
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,500
Yes.

1886
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,420
Because I act very well.

1887
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,700
It can’t be your first time meeting him.

1888
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,500
I think

1889
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,820
it really is my first time meeting him.

1890
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,780
What about you?

1891
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,140
It’s my first time too.

1892
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,700
You met him before, right?

1893
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,740
I filmed before.

1894
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,260
But I haven’t worked with him.

1895
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,140
She’s the one who’s worked with him.

1896
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,500
But I was her assistant.

1897
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,340
Then you two are very suspicious.

1898
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,740
Maybe the assistant wanted to ask the famous director,

1899
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,260
since all the big names are here,

1900
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,980
does our artist still have a chance?

1901
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,900
You wanted to go at 9:30

1902
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,740
to help her out a bit.

1903
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,500
Knock, the door opens—

1904
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,420
What? There’s some dirt.

1905
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,860
Murder for love.

1906
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,740
The clever you saw it,

1907
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:55,780
your eyes flashed,

1908
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,420
and you planned everything in just five minutes.

1909
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,300
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

1910
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,940
You seem a bit uncomfortable, I feel like you—

1911
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,420
I really think you're both nervous and uncomfortable.

1912
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,100
Okay.

1913
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,780
Wait a second.

1914
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,140
Is he a bit uncomfortable?

1915
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:15,740
Hold on.

1916
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,500
No, you know, from my angle—

1917
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,060
I can see this side of his face.

1918
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,820
The veins on this side are bulging.

1919
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,300
Who would have thought the billion-dollar director—

1920
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,060
During work hours today—

1921
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,180
This person is the killer.

1922
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,260
The six-character profile cards—

1923
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,500
have always been kept in his office.

1924
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,380
No one has seen them.

1925
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,780
We haven't seen this paper.

1926
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:34,300
He only gave it to us for auditioning.

1927
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,100
There's no "Death Demon" in this.

1928
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,180
So that information is fake.

1929
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,700
Then tricked him into that room.

1930
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,140
Someone used the "Death Demon" entry—

1931
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:42,540
and switched it.

1932
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,460
The one who switched it is the killer.

1933
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,500
What does he want to do?

1934
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,780
He wants you to kill someone.

1935
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,820
Wait, why did this water turn black?

1936
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,300
Maybe there's poison in here.

1937
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,300
Maybe it's that poison.

1938
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,100
The bowl didn't turn black.

1939
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:54,620
The face turned black.

1940
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,780
His whole face—he must have covered his face with it.

1941
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,380
A girl definitely couldn't do this.

1942
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,100
So this mechanism—

1943
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,220
must create an alibi for him.

1944
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,060
What I'm trying to say is—

1945
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,540
This is way too much of a coincidence.

1946
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,700
It really seems like the work of an instigator.

1947
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:08,820
Hello

1948
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,020
Someone called to buy.

1949
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,380
And another person called to ask.

1950
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,780
The first one bought, the second one asked.

1951
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,860
This inquirer is the only one with a god's-eye view.

1952
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,180
Why did the inquirer send the underling to kill?

1953
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,860
I think he probably doesn't know who it is.

1954
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,820
Then there's another question.

1955
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,980
We're all actors.

1956
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,540
We want to be in this director's play.

1957
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,060
Does he really want to kill the boss,

1958
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,180
or does he want to avenge his friend?

1959
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,740
That would be killing two birds with one stone.

1960
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,380
So actually, the real murderer

1961
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:32,220
the one we're looking for is the instigator.

1962
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:32,620
No.

1963
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,140
I still want to find the perpetrator.

1964
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,500
If I taught you,

1965
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,860
wouldn't I still be considered a murderer?

1966
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,700
I think your logic is too weak.

1967
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,900
Actually, having two murderers also makes sense.

1968
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,860
So how do we vote?

1969
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,780
Who do we vote for?
