1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,520
What is this place?

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,080
Observation room.

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
Aguai was locked up in here.

4
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,960
Since childhood.

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
The year 2020.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,080
Aguai met

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,760
a friend.

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,000
The username here is Jin Pengyou.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
That's my friend.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Is that the killer?

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
If you see what's written on the notice,

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
you might mistakenly think someone came to kill him.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
But when you see this person,

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,879
you'll know he's not my friend.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm not saying I saw your face and stabbed you.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,040
So,

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,440
actually, before he was smashed or stabbed to death,

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
he had already

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,040
turned into a monster.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,960
Everyone started getting poisoned today.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,400
Only after Aguai came out

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,480
could the virus spread.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,600
This bracelet was taken from the body of the deceased.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
We are the outstanding graduates of 2024.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,400
So this category only exists

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
among the six of us.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,520
Is it possible that Jin Pengyou

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,920
is here in place of Aguai?

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,640
And Aguai left.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
The real Aguai

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
is among the six of us.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
That victim might actually be Aguai.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
So, following this logic,

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,760
let's not focus on who poisoned them for now.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
The poison must have come from Aguai.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,160
Right.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,360
Then our first priority now

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,000
is to confirm whether the victim is really Aguai.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
That's the logic.

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,480
Look, between Jin Pengyou and Aguai,

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,600
only one of them can be dead.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
So next,

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
we just need to find either one of them.

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
That should be enough, right?

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,280
If we find one of them,

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
we can identify the other.

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,040
Let's go.

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,240
Wait a moment.

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
What is this thing?

50
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
This is a funhouse mirror.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,880
Dress up as your favorite character.

52
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,960
Complete the "Coca-Cola" character pose challenge.

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Dress up as a character.

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,840
I just want to clearly pick up

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,520
these sunglasses I like.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm basically a fashionista.

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,360
So usually, I should be

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
someone who likes surfing the internet.

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,600
So I'll choose this one.

61
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,880
"Onlooker"

62
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Come on.

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Let's complete its challenge.

64
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,960
First pose.

65
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,640
Attention seeker.

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
And the second one is

67
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,080
Vibe maker.

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,440
Vibe maker.

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
The third one, extrovert.

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,480
Heart gesture.

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,280
We did it.

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,760
Thanks to Coca-Cola.

73
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,600
Today,

74
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
I think our

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
"fashionista" and "onlooker"

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,280
also came together because of Coca-Cola.

77
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,080
So let's all

78
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
thank Coca-Cola together.

79
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Let's share Coca-Cola.

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
Cheers together.

81
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,520
Let's have fun with the Coca-Cola sharing bottle.

82
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
Let's happily push the case.

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,600
Cheers!

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,880
Cassette tape

85
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay

86
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240
This is a very important piece of evidence

87
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,800
Very important evidence

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
I will definitely protect Aguai

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,160
He will become a normal child

90
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Living under the sunlight

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a group photo

92
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
The photo from just now

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Diagnostic criteria for rare genetic diseases in Tui City

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
and clinical practice guidelines

95
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
Recently, medical experts

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,320
held a seminar on genetic diseases

97
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,480
At the seminar, experts pointed out

98
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,200
the diagnostic criteria for "Madness Syndrome"

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
"Madness Syndrome" is classified as

100
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,680
a neurological disorder

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,920
characterized by sudden, uncontrollable

102
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,520
extreme emotions

103
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,960
However, this disease is not frequent

104
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
and only occurs once every few years

105
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
Emotional loss of control

106
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,280
Instantly shifting from a calm state

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,000
to a state of rage and mania

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Loss of self-control

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Abnormal behavior

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,960
Self-harm and aggression

111
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Biting living creatures and destroying objects

112
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,920
Temporary regression of language abilities

113
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
Physiological reactions

114
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Abnormally elevated adrenaline levels

115
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,240
Pain perception

116
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
Temporary dulling of pain sensation

117
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
Unable to feel pain

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,760
Yes

119
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
Impaired consciousness

120
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,480
A sense of detachment from reality may occur during episodes

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,360
Unable to recognize real objects and people

122
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,240
Episodes may result in partial amnesia afterward

123
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,000
So, in fact, the so-called "monsters"

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
are actually people suffering from this rare genetic disease

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
I'll open it for you.

126
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,480
Got it.

127
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,440
Why are you pretending to be Gen Z?

128
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,240
The other side.

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
Don't tell me you've never used this before.

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
I haven't. I've never even seen it.

131
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Really?

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,080
Really.

133
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Alright, let's listen to this.

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Don't blame Aguai.

135
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Even though he just bit me,

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
you know he's just sick.

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
This is Mom, right?

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
He's only six years old.

139
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,720
You must cure our son.

140
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
Mom.

141
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Hide him well.

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,680
Don't let anyone find him.

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
And don't let him hurt anyone.

144
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
Mom asked Dad to protect Aguai.

145
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,120
That's why Dad kept Aguai here.

146
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,600
To study his illness, right?

147
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
To find a cure.

148
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,400
This is the factory Aguai's dad set up.

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Because he promised Mom to protect Aguai.

150
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,160
To treat Aguai.

151
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,400
So Aguai wouldn't hurt anyone.

152
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
So all these years,

153
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
he's been researching these medicines.

154
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Mom passed away, didn't she?

155
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Mom was bitten.

156
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
Why did his father, in this situation,

157
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
end up becoming

158
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,080
the person he hated the most?

159
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,760
His child doesn't know.

160
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,920
He just feels like his dad is imprisoning him,

161
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
not letting him see the outside world.

162
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
Aguai, let me think for a moment.

163
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
He just feels like his dad is imprisoning him,

164
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
not letting him see the outside world.

165
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Aguai met a friend (Jin Pengyou).

166
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,560
In July, I received

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
an acceptance letter for the Directing major at Tuiyi.

168
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
That was the top art school I had always dreamed of.

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
2024 Outstanding Graduate Commemoration

170
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,440
All six of us were among the outstanding graduates.

171
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,600
The person who died today, whose face was unrecognizable,

172
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
was actually the one in

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
our six-person graduation photo,

174
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
one of us.

175
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,320
If the one from four years ago was Jin Pengyou,

176
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,640
is it possible that Jin Pengyou

177
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,040
was here in place of Aguai,

178
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,760
and Aguai had left?

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
The year 2020.

180
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
Graduated after 2024.

181
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,560
Graduated together with us.

182
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
The real Aguai

183
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
was among the six of us.

184
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
But that's impossible.

185
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
Aguai has this illness.

186
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,120
How could he possibly study seriously?

187
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
He said it flares up every few years.

188
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Yes, that's true.

189
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
This Aguai must have

190
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
wanted to escape.

191
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,400
Then he dug

192
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
used a spoon to dig that tunnel.

193
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
So he was prepared.

194
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,640
But no one replaced him.

195
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,320
Locked in here,

196
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,080
the person who died

197
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,720
According to what was just said, it's Jin Pengyou.

198
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
If he is Jin Pengyou,

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,480
then it's Jin Pengyou

200
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,200
who took Aguai's place here.

201
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,720
He was the one wearing the patient's gown as Aguai.

202
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
So he changed out of the patient's gown.

203
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,000
That red-haired one is Jin Pengyou.

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,480
Right.

205
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Yes.

206
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,800
So when he said

207
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
the note said

208
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,040
"I want to get revenge on that person,"

209
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
what he really meant was

210
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Aguai—he wants to get revenge on Aguai.

211
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
No

212
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,520
I don't agree with your point of view.

213
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,080
Go ahead.

214
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
For example,

215
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Jin Pengyou came.

216
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,680
Aguai met him.

217
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,440
Then Aguai said,

218
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Then I'll live as Jin Pengyou.

219
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,920
Go out and live like that. But why?

220
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
No, I can change to another identity.

221
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,880
I can be called

222
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,800
Ning Que Wu Lan.

223
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
I can be called Ke Ban Chushen.

224
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,520
But we

225
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,040
We only met at school.

226
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,800
We didn't know each other before.

227
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
So where did Ke Ban Chushen go?

228
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,800
If he was replaced,

229
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
Ke Ban Chushen

230
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,640
doesn't exist.

231
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I can

232
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
create a fictional Ke Ban Chushen.

233
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,320
I think the most crucial question is

234
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,400
where did this come from?

235
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
If the bracelet belongs to Aguai,

236
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
how did Jin Pengyou get Aguai's bracelet?

237
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
Only the six of us have it.

238
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,440
So if he has one,

239
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,560
did he grab it when he went to find him?

240
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Is that how it happened?

241
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
Was it snatched?

242
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
I want to go over the timeline.

243
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Because the time he was poisoned

244
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
was twelve thirty, right?

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
It was the 22nd.

246
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,040
Today is the 23rd, right?

247
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
Yes.

248
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Right, so at 8 p.m. on the 22nd

249
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
we saw him biting his sleeve.

250
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,680
That was yesterday for us.

251
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,440
While we were still working on that case,

252
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
his incident was happening at the same time.

253
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Yes, that's how it is.

254
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
Yes, that's right.

255
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
If it's 8:30,

256
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
counting back eight hours,

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,760
that would be noon.

258
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
At noon, the two of us were up to no good.

259
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,240
What I was just saying is,

260
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,600
there must be a bad guy among us.

261
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
That's right, there definitely is.

262
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
We need to find more evidence for this.

263
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
Is there anything we haven't opened yet?

264
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,640
That lock hasn't been opened.

265
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Right.

266
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,720
Let's try it.

267
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes.

268
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,000
On this,

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
is there any number or something?

270
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
2003.

271
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,800
2003.

272
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
This one.

273
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
This one says 2025.

274
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
There's a date on the tape.

275
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
There's a date on the tape.

276
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,960
Let me do it. I'll handle it.

277
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,240
It's obvious you're not from this era.

278
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,440
There's a December 31st.

279
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,679
Try 1231 first.

280
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,280
1231.

281
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
1231 worked, it's open.

282
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
Impressive.

283
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Then the other one is...

284
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,560
2003 has a key number.

285
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,160
2003.

286
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,000
That's not right.

287
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,920
Don't blame A-Guai.

288
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
When did Mom die?

289
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
Six years old. He said he was six.

290
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,040
He's the same age as A-Jin's friend.

291
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,800
They're the same age.

292
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
Eighteen.

293
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
He was eighteen in 2020.

294
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
So that's 2002.

295
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
The year 2002.

296
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
You're still the smart one.

297
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
Six.

298
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
2008

299
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
2008 has started

300
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,040
(200)8 has started

301
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,120
I don't know why either

302
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Let's

303
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,040
Let's think about it

304
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,920
Why 2008

305
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Because 2003 plus 5

306
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
equals 2008

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,080
So it's 2008

308
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Then I could also say it's 2000

309
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
plus 8 equals 2008

310
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,520
So it's 2008 then

311
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,240
Right, then it's even more likely to be 2008

312
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
Because we did two calculations

313
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,120
Both answers are 2008

314
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
Then I could also say 2001 plus 7

315
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,920
Right, that's even more so

316
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,120
Has it started?

317
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
We just stumbled into it by accident

318
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,960
In 2020, it's eighteen years old

319
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
Then it's 2002

320
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,440
When did Mom die?

321
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,000
At six years old

322
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,720
He said he was six

323
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,760
2002 plus 6

324
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
Right, of course, it still has to be

325
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Right, of course, it still has to be

326
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,360
It still has to be the "killer"

327
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
It still has to be the "killer" who's smart

328
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Aguai's plastic surgery

329
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,120
September 18, 2020

330
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
Full facial and vocal cord reconstruction

331
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,800
Due to external impact

332
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Face and vocal cords completely damaged

333
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Reconstructive surgery required

334
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
Aguai tried to escape again

335
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,280
He even hurt himself

336
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,360
He was seriously injured

337
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
He must be repaired through surgery

338
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
Fortunately, Aguai was found in time this time

339
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,920
To prevent him from escaping and getting into trouble again

340
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,840
I need to put on him

341
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
a tracking wristband

342
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,840
Put on a tracking wristband

343
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Tracking wristband

344
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
What does that mean?

345
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,520
October 18, 2024

346
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,000
Aguai has fully recovered physically

347
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,320
His appearance and voice have been restored

348
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
Let me tell you this

349
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
You see, when plastic surgery comes up

350
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,280
it always means

351
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
there will be an identity swap

352
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,080
That's the point

353
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,520
That's right

354
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,160
Look, September 18, 2020

355
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,280
He had

356
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,000
damage to his whole face and vocal cords

357
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,520
then surgery

358
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,880
The reason for the damage was

359
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
external impact

360
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Right

361
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
September 18, 2020

362
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
Think back, was it you two driving?

363
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,880
Think back, was it you two driving?

364
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
No, it was August 15

365
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,960
Right, so August 15

366
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,680
Wasn't his whole face wrapped in bandages?

367
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,760
Yes

368
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,200
So the person who had surgery was Jin's friend

369
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,160
Don't look at that, look at this.

370
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
The one who died is Aguai.

371
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
When Aguai was still alive,

372
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
the virus in his body was not fatal

373
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,240
and was not contagious.

374
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay.

375
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,640
If Aguai dies,

376
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
the virus will mutate within eight hours.

377
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,840
Once the virus has fully mutated,

378
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,400
it will become highly contagious.

379
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,080
And then?

380
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,640
At the same time,

381
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,400
the deceased Aguai

382
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,040
will have red hair

383
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,800
and red markings will appear on his skin.

384
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,560
That's scary.

385
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,320
He will regain mobility

386
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,040
and show high aggression

387
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
and spread the virus.

388
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,160
He will become a true source of infection.

389
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,080
The deceased Aguai

390
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,800
will have red hair

391
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,320
and red markings on his skin.

392
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,640
That's scary.

393
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,480
Aguai blames me for always keeping him locked up.

394
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
It's okay if he doesn't understand me.

395
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,520
To cure his illness,

396
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,320
I have to spend all my time

397
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,640
on experimental research.

398
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,120
The last page is

399
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
April 22, 2025.

400
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
8 p.m.

401
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
That's when I realized Aguai was missing.

402
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
He must have run out again.

403
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
I have to find him and bring him back.

404
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,640
So it's because Aguai died

405
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
So everyone in this building

406
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,600
got infected

407
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,920
got infected

408
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
mutated

409
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,080
Right

410
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,960
turned into monsters

411
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,680
Right

412
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,480
Everything we've been discussing just now is all about

413
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Ba Mian Linglong died from physical causes.

414
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
The other case was death by poisoning.

415
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,320
But now, poisoning isn't involved anymore.

416
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,040
He has had this poison since childhood.

417
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,440
Yes.

418
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
His second revival today

419
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
was inevitable.

420
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,200
So the first time,

421
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,440
he just happened to have an attack.

422
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,280
Right.

423
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,920
That's what happened today.

424
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,600
In this script,

425
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:56,960
that's correct.

426
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,400
So someone made his hair turn red.

427
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
That means one of us

428
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,280
killed him and spread the virus.

429
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,800
That's right, meaning

430
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
Aguai, when his hair turned red,

431
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,840
before he was impaled by the steel bar,

432
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
was already dead.

433
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes.

434
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,760
The killer used another method

435
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
not involving viral infection

436
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,880
to kill him.

437
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,240
It might not have been poison,

438
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,680
maybe he was punched and died from shock.

439
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,240
Right.

440
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,520
Or maybe he was hit on the back of the head or stabbed with the steel bar.

441
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Exactly.

442
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,600
Any of those are possible.

443
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,760
Yes.

444
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
How do we deduce this?

445
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,680
Now you just need to find out

446
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,040
who would want to kill Aguai.

447
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,880
The one who died today is definitely Aguai.

448
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
There's no doubt about it.

449
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,360
Yes.

450
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Wait a moment.

451
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,520
I want to ask a question.

452
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,240
About this plastic surgery—

453
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,040
What is its purpose?

454
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,760
If Aguai is just Aguai,

455
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,800
and Aguai was quietly staying inside,

456
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,280
then this Aguai—

457
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,040
was this person with Aguai during that time?

458
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,160
I don't know.

459
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,880
I mean this person—

460
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
they must look exactly like Aguai,

461
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,520
right?

462
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

463
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
There was a note that said,

464
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
"I considered you a friend,"

465
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
"but you wanted to kill me,"

466
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,000
or something like that.

467
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,840
A flyer.

468
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,640
Number nine.

469
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,560
Next to the locker in storage room number nine.

470
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,640
I can't believe you did that back then.

471
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,440
I considered you a friend.

472
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
But you wanted to kill me.

473
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,960
I will definitely get revenge on you.

474
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,000
Could it be Jin Pengyou?

475
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,840
The words said to Aguai.

476
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Let's clarify things first.

477
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,920
Aguai is dead, right?

478
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Aguai was killed by one of us—

479
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
by that murderer—

480
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
killed in some way.

481
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,960
Let's start with the most obvious.

482
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
Why did the killer want to kill Aguai?

483
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,880
Is it possible

484
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
that it's a conflict between Aguai and Jin Pengyou

485
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,600
and they tried to kill each other?

486
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,760
Like the poster says, "I treat you as a friend,"

487
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,920
"but you want to kill me,"

488
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
"I want revenge."

489
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,880
Is it possible that Jin Pengyou

490
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,680
wanted to kill Aguai?

491
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,280
A fake Aguai.

492
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
I don't understand.

493
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,880
What I mean is,

494
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
Aguai escaped,

495
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,000
and went to school with us.

496
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,640
Right.

497
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,360
Jin Pengyou was left here to take Aguai's place.

498
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
This time, Jin Pengyou came out wanting to kill Aguai.

499
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,400
I think that's how it is.

500
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,240
So the two of them probably

501
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,400
share one identity,

502
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
or at least the same face.

503
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,040
One face means one identity.

504
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
I get what you mean.

505
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
The victim must be Aguai.

506
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
The Aguai who has already died.

507
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,520
That's why the hair turned red.

508
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,440
If Jin Pengyou killed Aguai,

509
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,480
then Jin Pengyou could take Aguai's place

510
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,720
and blend in among us.

511
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,960
It must be a guy.

512
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Then the culprit from yesterday

513
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
can't be the culprit in this case.

514
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,320
Right?

515
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,440
So you two are ruled out.

516
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,400
Now it's just you two.

517
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
Alright, classic one out of two.

518
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160
It's down to a fifty-fifty choice.

519
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
I think it really feels like a fifty-fifty.

520
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
Because one of you has been there,

521
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,280
and turned into a "zombie,"

522
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
while the other stayed with us

523
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,560
and remained

524
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,640
in this lab.

525
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
Sir, it wasn't me.

526
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,200
You have new mail, please check.

527
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
That scared me to death.

528
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
You have new mail, please check.

529
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,000
Computer.

530
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
Computer.

531
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,160
There's only this one computer, right?

532
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,480
Wristband positioning system.

533
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,560
Aguai has a wristband.

534
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,760
Factory, first floor. Let's go.

535
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Okay, let's go.

536
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,520
Go, let's go.

537
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,360
How do we get out?

538
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
We need to go to the spot on the first floor.

539
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,600
Go to the first floor.

540
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,320
Right.

541
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,040
To the right of the elevator

542
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,880
No, it shouldn't be this

543
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,440
This is it

544
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,120
Is it right here, to the right of the elevator?

545
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,760
Let's go

546
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,400
There shouldn't be any more monsters, right?

547
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
No, there are no more monsters

548
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
There's a watch here, right here

549
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,760
The location is here

550
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,080
So, Aguai's wristband

551
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,480
Why is it here?

552
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Come on, let's start searching, come on

553
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
No

554
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,000
What's this?

555
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,040
There's blood

556
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
That barrel, there's something in that barrel

557
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Yeah

558
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,720
There's a steel bar, with blood on it

559
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,320
Take it, take this bloody steel bar

560
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
Take everything for now

561
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,960
See if there's anything else here, keep looking

562
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
Have you finished searching?

563
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,280
Should we check under the bricks?

564
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,359
Sorry.

565
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
What's wrong?

566
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,160
There's writing.

567
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Where is it?

568
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,680
Sorry.

569
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,760
Who's apologizing to whom?

570
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,800
This is a passage.

571
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,359
There's a passage here.

572
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,640
I just saw a passage behind here.

573
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,520
Let's see where this leads.

574
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,240
Let's see where this is.

575
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,760
If we go out here, we'll be outside the building, bro.

576
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,920
Let's go. Take the stuff with us.

577
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,960
Is this the place where he bit his sleeve yesterday?

578
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,640
Yes.

579
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Right?

580
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,960
So where are we going?

581
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,280
So who is that?

582
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,440
So that...

583
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Who is that?

584
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,200
Help him up, quickly.

585
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,440
That's all of them.

586
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
The people we rescued.

587
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
The rescued people, got it.

588
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,280
Okay, got it.

589
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,040
If that's all, let's hurry back.

590
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Let's go, quickly.

591
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Catch him!

592
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720
Get him!

593
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,320
Catch him!

594
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,080
Hurry!

595
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
How come you guys...

596
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
How could you not catch up to him?

597
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
It's not that, he was just too fast.

598
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,880
Nothing we can do.

599
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,680
You said it all.

600
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,200
Who cut the lock?

601
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
I wanted to ask about that just now.

602
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,960
Who cut the lock on the door?

603
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
It must have been that person from earlier.

604
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
The mysterious person.

605
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,800
He was holding a small box.

606
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,640
Inside, it looked like a potted plant.

607
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,280
A bonsai, a miniature landscape.

608
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,920
Yes, like those things used in sand table simulations.

609
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,800
How is your investigation going?

610
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,560
Any progress?

611
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,640
I brought something for you.

612
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,360
Okay.

613
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
Puzzle-solving and reasoning tests, all available on Tongcheng.

614
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
This is prepared for everyone by Tongcheng Travel.

615
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,920
An evidence-searching assistant tool.

616
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,120
I hope it helps everyone organize the clues.

617
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,240
And clarify the logical connections.

618
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
It's time to uncover the truth.

619
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,840
Let's set off together with Tongcheng.

620
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you.

621
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,640
What is it?

622
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
I believe you will definitely

623
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,760
figure out the truth soon.

624
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
I'll get back to work now.

625
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,760
Goodbye.

626
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,640
Let's take a look at what's in the bucket.

627
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,640
Okay.

628
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,320
Come and see.

629
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,480
I've got one here.

630
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
I just picked up a watch earlier, but I didn't take it out.

631
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,360
The time it stopped at is

632
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,000
April 22nd, 12:15 p.m.

633
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
So our assumption was correct.

634
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Yesterday at noon,

635
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,360
at 12:15,

636
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,680
he died.

637
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,360
12:15 p.m.

638
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,080
What was everyone doing then?

639
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,760
Yesterday at 12:15 p.m.,

640
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,160
were we all together?

641
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,240
That doesn't matter.

642
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,360
Let's take a look.

643
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
What were you doing at 12:15?

644
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,360
Hurry up and explain.

645
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,920
Yesterday at noon,

646
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,280
what were you doing at 12:15?

647
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,080
At 12 o'clock, I...

648
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
He was...

649
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,760
in the bathroom.

650
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,680
At that time, on the 22nd,

651
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
I was in the bathroom taking care of my mouth.

652
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,840
Why?

653
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,400
Because I was worried there might be a kissing scene.

654
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,760
You're lying. I didn't see you.

655
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,280
You were in the restroom too.

656
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

657
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,240
I had diarrhea from twelve to twelve thirty.

658
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,720
I didn't see you either.

659
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,400
Wait.

660
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,800
This is a classic either-or situation.

661
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,120
A classic either-or.

662
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
I was taking care of my oral hygiene.

663
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,600
I wasn't doing it in the stall.

664
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,120
I know.

665
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
You had diarrhea for half an hour?

666
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,840
Yes.

667
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
I was taking care of my oral hygiene for half an hour.

668
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,720
Yes.

669
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,840
Then that's settled.

670
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,400
But I didn't see you.

671
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,960
I didn't see you either.

672
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
I don't know if he's lying or not.

673
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
All I can say is he definitely wasn't there.

674
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,800
From twelve to twelve thirty,

675
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,920
I was taking care of my oral hygiene in the restroom near the red carpet.

676
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,520
You were there.

677
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,720
What about you?

678
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,080
From twelve to twelve thirty,

679
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,680
I was in the restroom in the office area.

680
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
Take off your sunglasses.

681
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Yes.

682
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,920
Don't avoid eye contact with us.

683
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,200
That just makes you look more suspicious.

684
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,840
Yes.

685
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
From twelve to twelve thirty

686
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,880
I was resting in the break room

687
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I even took some time to practice my lines

688
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,920
I even took some time to practice my lines

689
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
I was in the restroom over here

690
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,240
I didn't hear you practicing your lines

691
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,720
I was practicing my lines quietly

692
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,120
I was practicing the kind of lines

693
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,240
Lines like this

694
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Of course you couldn't hear me

695
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,840
What I need to practice is

696
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,360
When I play a spy in the future

697
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,800
How I pass secret messages

698
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,360
From twelve to twelve thirty

699
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,520
I was filming a video for Ba at the foot of Tiebu Mountain

700
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,600
You two can vouch for each other

701
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
Ba and I can vouch for each other

702
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
So he's already been ruled out?

703
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,080
Yes, you've been ruled out

704
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,840
Yes, you've been ruled out

705
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,120
Okay

706
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,080
This round will be our highlight

707
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
I've waited too long for this moment

708
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,040
Today, we'll join forces

709
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,160
Let's catch this culprit, okay?

710
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,240
Our team will be called "Ningjing"

711
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,360
Ningjing

712
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,920
"Ningjing"

713
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
Alright, we'll be called "Ningjing"

714
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,160
Sister Jing, bless us

715
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,400
What's this?

716
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
Right, the stuff in this bucket just now

717
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,560
We still haven't

718
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,200
Friend

719
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You must become a director with ten billion in box office

720
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,760
You must become a director with ten billion in box office

721
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,120
Who did he help become a ten-billion box office director?

722
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,160
Friend

723
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,480
I am an orphan

724
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,120
I used all my candy

725
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,200
to make a few good friends

726
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
2008, crossed out

727
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
I thought friendship was pure

728
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
but I forgot how complicated people are

729
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I was so happy to help everyone with their homework

730
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,960
2015, crossed out

731
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,040
A true friend won't make you feel small

732
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,720
Instead, they'll make you feel seen

733
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,760
and respected

734
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,240
He turned our secrets into jokes

735
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,040
Is this really a friend?

736
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,680
2017, crossed out

737
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,520
Bullying often wears the disguise of friendship

738
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
But a true friend

739
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
won't use your weaknesses to hurt you

740
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,440
I never thought you'd treat me like this

741
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
September 17, 2020

742
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,920
Aguai, sleeping pills

743
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,600
Wait, who is this?

744
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:42,920
Jin Pengyou

745
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,480
Jin Pengyou

746
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,840
Aguai and Jin Pengyou are good friends

747
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,360
The sleeping pills were given

748
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,640
to Jin Pengyou

749
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Wait

750
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,920
I can't believe four years have passed.

751
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,520
I've finally recovered.

752
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,240
But I actually turned into you.

753
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,520
You ruined my whole life.

754
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,040
I won't let you get away with it.

755
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,560
That's why I said we switched identities.

756
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,520
Had plastic surgery.

757
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,400
This is Jin Pengyou's notebook.

758
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,080
Because Jin has, since childhood,

759
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,880
been able to live in a normal environment.

760
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,080
Aguai was kept locked up.

761
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,560
So this is his past experience.

762
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,080
He was bullied by classmates.

763
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,760
By classmates, so...

764
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,160
Then he recorded how Aguai, back then,

765
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,840
after drugging him unconscious,

766
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,080
after giving him sleeping pills,

767
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,680
then turned into him.

768
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
Yes, it must be what Jin Pengyou said.

769
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,240
Jin Pengyou became Aguai.

770
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
So now they're sharing

771
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,160
Aguai's face.

772
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,800
So that means Jin Pengyou became Aguai.

773
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,240
So this Jin Pengyou

774
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
is now one of us.

775
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,040
Yes.

776
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
This Jin Pengyou

777
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,600
is definitely among us now.

778
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,240
He turned into Aguai.

779
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,600
How did he end up among you?

780
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,400
Let me start from there.

781
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
For example,

782
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
Aguai turned Jin Pengyou into Aguai.

783
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,920
Let's just call him Jin Guai.

784
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,640
Okay, Jin Guai.

785
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,440
Alright, Jin Guai is locked up.

786
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
He said, "I'm finally cured."

787
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,240
That was in 2024.

788
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,200
It's fine.

789
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,440
He came out.

790
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes.

791
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,120
He said, "Alright, I'm going to find Aguai."

792
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,600
So why did he come today?

793
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,800
To take revenge.

794
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,560
Yes, I'm here to get him.

795
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,080
Watch closely.

796
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,480
You ruined my whole life.

797
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,920
I won't let you off easy.

798
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
The year 2024.

799
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,200
This was the plastic surgery his dad arranged for him.

800
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,720
Right?

801
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
So from 2020 to 2024,

802
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,240
he maintained this face for four years.

803
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
He grew to look like Jin Pengyou.

804
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,320
He was made to look like Aguai.

805
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Aguai's appearance.

806
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,320
He became Jin Guai.

807
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,480
No, wait a second.

808
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Here's what I want to say.

809
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
The one who died today was Aguai.

810
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,680
That's right.

811
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,760
So Aguai used to be with us

812
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,480
and lived together with us.

813
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,680
The person with the wristband

814
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,240
Yes

815
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
Today's culprit is Jin Pengyou

816
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,200
Jin Pengyou

817
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,920
Yes, among the few of us right now

818
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,440
That also means

819
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,360
He hasn't

820
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,280
been with us before

821
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,120
Because he was locked up for four years

822
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,720
Yes

823
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
Jin Pengyou was locked up as A Guai

824
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,520
When did he escape?

825
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,640
It was early yesterday morning, right?

826
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,320
Yes

827
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
At 8 p.m.

828
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,680
That's when I realized A Guai was missing

829
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,200
He must have run off again

830
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,280
On the morning of the 22nd

831
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,440
Around eight or nine o'clock

832
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,120
Eight or nine o'clock

833
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,360
I saw someone

834
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,600
He was wearing a hospital gown

835
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
Later, at the factory

836
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,760
and at the entrance of Tui Baiyi Film Company

837
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,520
I saw him again

838
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,440
wandering around there

839
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,040
Yesterday, he suddenly got a chance

840
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,240
to escape and kill A Guai

841
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,560
He came to take A Guai's identity

842
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,640
Yes

843
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
He used to go by A Guai

844
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,720
Now, at this moment, he goes by Jin Pengyou

845
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,120
Yes

846
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,000
Who? Who are we looking for now?

847
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,760
It's my Jin Pengyou

848
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,120
Yes

849
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,560
It was Aguai who wanted to run away.

850
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,280
He left Jin Pengyou behind.

851
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,000
He became his father's test subject.

852
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,760
Yes.

853
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
He himself.

854
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,320
Aguai ran away by himself.

855
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,680
Yes.

856
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,640
That's right, yes.

857
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
So now we need to find

858
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,280
the one who attended with us

859
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,640
Who was Aguai for those four years?

860
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,000
He has now been replaced by Jin Pengyou.

861
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,680
Let's see if there are any clues left.

862
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
That "Sorry"...

863
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
I also think it's a bit strange.

864
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
Who wrote that "Sorry"?

865
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
I think Aguai wrote it.

866
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
Before dying,

867
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
using his own blood,

868
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,960
he wrote "Sorry".

869
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,600
Sorry.

870
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,280
Because "Sorry" was written in blood.

871
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,400
Did Aguai think he did something wrong?

872
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,440
Yes.

873
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Where did this bag come from?

874
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,840
It was in that barrel.

875
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
Found at the scene.

876
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,560
Why did he want to burn this bag?

877
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
To destroy the evidence.

878
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,680
So that means

879
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,000
Aguai's diary.

880
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,720
It records the details of his life.

881
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,080
During the four years at Tuiyi,

882
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,760
I lived a life I could only imagine before.

883
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,040
I met all kinds of friends.

884
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,760
They taught me how to grow.

885
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,400
They taught me what true friendship is.

886
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,400
I've met many fascinating people.

887
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,040
And I've heard about many bizarre things.

888
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Some have fallen into the abyss,

889
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,760
and still drag their friends down with them.

890
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,800
Some play the victim to their friends to gain resources.

891
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,920
Some, when their lives are threatened,

892
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,920
trade their friends' lives for their own survival.

893
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,080
Some use their friends to stand up for them.

894
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,840
Some, through scheming,

895
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,600
make their friends take the blame for them.

896
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,720
Some make mistakes themselves,

897
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
but let their friends take the fall.

898
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
When they stumble,

899
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
when they are in desperate situations,

900
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,120
they don't try to escape,

901
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,440
but instead plot

902
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,960
how to make others take the blame for them.

903
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,320
When they can't turn things around,

904
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,960
they don't face the consequences,

905
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,840
but look for the next

906
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,000
person to take the fall for them.

907
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,520
I casually recorded these things.

908
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,160
I compiled them into "Strange Tales of Deduction."

909
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,440
This is the "Strange Tales of Deduction" he wrote.

910
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
Although these stories

911
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,000
sound like horror legends,

912
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,240
the truly terrifying story

913
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,200
might be my own past.

914
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,920
I was once a monster trapped in an iron cage.

915
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,240
My father used darkness to treat me.

916
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,880
In the end, he made me a part of the darkness.

917
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
Recently, on a forum,

918
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,080
I met a new friend.

919
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,120
His name is Tuihao.

920
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,040
We often share things about our lives with each other.

921
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,280
It turns out his real name is

922
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Xi Sheng, Shi Xi Sheng.

923
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Shi Xi Sheng.

924
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,920
I met a new friend.

925
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,800
His name is Tuihao.

926
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,080
So both of them know Shi Xisheng.

927
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,840
Each of them is good friends with Shi Xisheng.

928
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,200
He told me

929
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,360
that true friendship doesn't require hurting yourself

930
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,800
or hurting others in exchange.

931
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,000
Thank you, Tuihao.

932
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,920
In my four years at Tuiyi, I was once the Star of Tuiyi.

933
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,440
I was also an outstanding graduate of Tuiyi.

934
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm finally about to graduate.

935
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm sure I'll have a better future.

936
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,800
Aren't all of us Stars of Tuiyi?

937
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,440
Yes.

938
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
That's right, that matches.

939
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
There's a little note on the first page, take a look.

940
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,920
The unlucky one will stay here in my place.

941
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,160
Imprisoned.

942
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,640
And I finally gained my freedom.

943
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,680
It's Aguai.

944
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,200
Aguai had a close friend take her place.

945
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,840
That's right.

946
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, and then Aguai got out.

947
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
She lived at Tuiyi for four years.

948
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
And at Tuiyi,

949
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,720
she became the Star of Tuiyi.

950
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,880
Are there any other clues?

951
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
What's this?

952
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,680
What is this?

953
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,400
What is this?

954
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,120
I didn't see this just now.

955
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,160
"Universal Black Market" transaction receipt

956
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,720
Transaction details

957
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,600
Pawned "Eight Stars Eight Diamonds"

958
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
One longevity gold locket

959
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
The above items have been traded

960
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,280
Both parties must adhere to strict confidentiality

961
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,120
Effective immediately

962
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,320
Trader: Aguai

963
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,080
A document for someone born in 2002

964
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
With no close relations

965
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,720
Male identification

966
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
The above transaction is complete

967
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,680
This is September 17, 2020

968
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,960
And a 2020 class

969
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,200
Admission spot for a freshman at Tui Town Art Academy

970
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,080
That's him

971
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,880
Right, September 17

972
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,800
He arranged everything on September 17

973
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
This actually proves that he

974
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,880
In 2020

975
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,600
Changed his identity

976
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
That identity switch

977
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,200
The key is this document

978
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
A document for someone born in 2002

979
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,840
A male identity with no close relations

980
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,280
Right, an orphan

981
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
Then let's investigate your backgrounds

982
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,880
Your background from childhood to now

983
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000
Big Star Orphanage

984
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,280
I'm from the Starlight Orphanage

985
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,520
An orphanage without a name

986
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,480
Just grew up in an orphanage

987
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,200
You are

988
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,640
I have so many friends

989
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
Friends like in fairy tales

990
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
If that's the case

991
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
His childhood can be verified

992
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,920
Right, because he couldn't have made it up

993
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,360
I was also born in an orphanage

994
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,920
But none of you have any proof

995
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,240
Do you know

996
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,320
He openly produced a piece of evidence

997
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,680
He was excluded

998
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
This was requested in 2020

999
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
It was also requested four years ago

1000
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
But what he talked about is

1001
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,080
A story from when he was six

1002
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
If he were the culprit

1003
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,040
I have no identity

1004
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,360
I wouldn't make up an identity

1005
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,880
I would just say

1006
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,480
I just grew up in an orphanage

1007
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
I wouldn't say

1008
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
I had a bunch of friends since I was little

1009
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
What he said can be verified

1010
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,960
You get this

1011
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,120
I think he should indeed be excluded

1012
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,920
Because all four of you are from the orphanage

1013
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,880
Yes, that's the logic

1014
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Then just make it consistent

1015
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,640
Why does he have this extra piece of evidence

1016
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,960
That's right

1017
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,680
So he was excluded

1018
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,480
That's fine

1019
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,920
Now only you two are left in this group

1020
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
So you two should have a competition.

1021
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,320
Who? The two of us compete?

1022
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,640
Yes.

1023
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
But we have nothing to compete over.

1024
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,160
His red hairstyle today—

1025
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,240
Could it be just

1026
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,160
just to look cool?

1027
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,000
No.

1028
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,240
He—

1029
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,600
You said your orphanage

1030
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,000
is called Big Star Orphanage.

1031
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
No.

1032
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,760
Mine is Starlight Orphanage.

1033
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Starlight (Orphanage).

1034
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Your orphanage—

1035
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,280
I don't have a name.

1036
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,440
I don't have a name.

1037
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,280
What?

1038
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,920
My orphanage just doesn't have a name.

1039
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,240
But I don't think it's him.

1040
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,640
If I were the killer,

1041
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
I would definitely make up a name.

1042
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,440
I was sent to

1043
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
Nameless Orphanage when I was a child.

1044
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,920
I want to know

1045
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,600
what your acting limit is right now.

1046
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,560
There is no limit.

1047
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,840
Of course, there's no lower limit either.

1048
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,120
That means I'm really good at acting.

1049
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
No upper or lower limit.

1050
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,600
Show me the evidence.

1051
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,920
Bring out the evidence and let me see.

1052
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,520
Really, I'm not lying to you.

1053
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,400
I was just sent to Nameless Orphanage.

1054
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,320
Then what do you have to argue about?

1055
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,280
If I think right now

1056
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,320
that you are definitely the killer,

1057
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,560
what would you say?

1058
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,440
I have nothing to say.

1059
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
You don't really have any reason to suspect me.

1060
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,600
Just because of an orphanage, you think I'm the killer?

1061
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,600
I just thought of something.

1062
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
Jin Pengyou took over.

1063
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,200
After replacing Aguai,

1064
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,680
is it possible

1065
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,920
that it actually happened between twelve and twelve thirty?

1066
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,040
They switched identities at that time.

1067
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Right?

1068
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,200
Yes.

1069
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,640
And then killed him.

1070
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,640
At that point,

1071
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
since Jin Pengyou

1072
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,120
had been in that secret room for four years,

1073
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
he actually hadn't been exposed to our performing arts

1074
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,840
or studied at the Tuizhen Academy of Arts.

1075
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,640
Right, he hadn't studied.

1076
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,720
He had no idea

1077
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
how to be an actor.

1078
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,200
After he came out,

1079
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,120
he was already at

1080
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,400
the selection competition venue.

1081
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,080
So what did he need to do?

1082
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,680
What did he need to do?

1083
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,560
All his actions after twelve o'clock

1084
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,240
must have been different from before.

1085
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,960
Let me give an example from my own experience.

1086
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,120
I'll start with myself.

1087
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
From twelve to twelve thirty,

1088
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,080
I was in the restroom.

1089
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,280
Taking care of my oral hygiene.

1090
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,720
Why was that?

1091
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Because I was worried there might be a kissing scene.

1092
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
I was afraid I wouldn't perform well.

1093
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So I went to take care of my mouth.

1094
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,880
After ten o'clock at night,

1095
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
after the previous case was wrapped up,

1096
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,160
I went to look for Director Shan after ten.

1097
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,880
I wanted to show Director Shan

1098
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,600
my acting talent.

1099
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,960
It was still related to acting.

1100
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,040
Of course, this was all about acting.

1101
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,280
I think that's absolutely right.

1102
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,240
As for Ning, I won't mention him.

1103
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,400
Ning couldn't make it because of scheduling.

1104
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,080
His timing didn't work out.

1105
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,720
And what about you?

1106
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,600
What did you do after ten?

1107
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,080
I went to socialize.

1108
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,160
What?

1109
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,040
Socialize with whom?

1110
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
With those actors.

1111
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,200
I wanted to find the assistant director.

1112
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,280
I chatted with those actors

1113
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,720
about how they became actors,

1114
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
and their understanding of this play.

1115
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,880
So I went to socialize.

1116
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,800
You went to socialize with the extras?

1117
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,120
When I went, the director wasn't there.

1118
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
Okay, what did you do?

1119
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,920
I went to find the person in charge of auditions.

1120
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
Didn't I come back and perform for you all?

1121
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,760
Like glaring eyes, or being stunned like a wooden chicken.

1122
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,520
I needed to get my character card.

1123
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,159
But I think if you suspect Bai now,

1124
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,239
then I would start to suspect you.

1125
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,040
I didn't suspect him.

1126
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,760
No, what I mean is,

1127
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,280
I even think he could be the one.

1128
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I didn't say I suspect him.

1129
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,000
To me, Bai is

1130
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,840
not as suspicious in this matter.

1131
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Because he got the role of an actor.

1132
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,120
He just needs to do what an actor does.

1133
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,639
If I were to audition for this play,

1134
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,199
I would only need to know how to do push-ups

1135
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,120
and just glare with wide eyes.

1136
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,440
I want to ask something.

1137
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,639
So he never went to school.

1138
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,960
He never studied acting, he...

1139
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,600
What he said is right.

1140
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,400
He's right.

1141
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah.

1142
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
So, the one here now,

1143
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,159
that murderer, Jin's friend,

1144
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,360
he has no acting talent.

1145
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,480
He doesn't even know what an actor is supposed to do.

1146
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,280
What he just said

1147
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
reminded me of something.

1148
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Go ahead.

1149
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,760
It's like us,

1150
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,840
with this personality-switching thing.

1151
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
After switching back,

1152
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,800
we have to

1153
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
live in this person's life.

1154
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,040
Suppose after switching back,

1155
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,560
this person lives in a new environment,

1156
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,800
and meets a bunch of new people.

1157
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,080
Do you think this person would still choose

1158
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,520
to interact more with the people

1159
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,840
who used to be close in his life,

1160
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,240
and have more contact with them?

1161
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,480
Who

1162
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
For example, you

1163
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,120
I'll use you as an example

1164
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,880
Suppose you are the culprit

1165
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,360
Okay, let's imagine that

1166
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,920
After Ning switched back

1167
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
And then you still

1168
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,160
Your...

1169
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,840
That character setting from yesterday

1170
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,560
Were you always pursuing Ba?

1171
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,280
Secretly in love

1172
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,800
A secret crush

1173
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,360
Yes, exactly

1174
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Anyway, there was still close contact

1175
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,720
For example, before this person came back

1176
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,640
You and Ba

1177
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,280
Hadn't you already been in contact all along?

1178
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,600
No

1179
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,040
After coming back

1180
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,600
Would you still choose to

1181
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,760
Keep interacting with her?

1182
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,440
During this process

1183
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,920
Is there a risk of being exposed?

1184
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,480
Wait a second

1185
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,800
Do you know?

1186
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,120
This is the point I'm trying to make

1187
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,160
Right?

1188
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,240
You get what I mean, right?

1189
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,800
Right?

1190
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,160
Okay

1191
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,080
Our current consensus is still

1192
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,160
Who is the one out of the two

1193
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,520
You think it's between the two of us

1194
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes

1195
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,000
I think so too

1196
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,520
I also think it's you two

1197
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,520
There's something wrong with him.

1198
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,640
What?

1199
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,600
It's him.

1200
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,680
Everyone, vote for him with me.

1201
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,560
He's the killer.

1202
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,760
Wait a second.

1203
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,400
Just now, I suddenly

1204
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,680
realized something.

1205
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,680
Because I'm clean right now,

1206
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,040
so my words are relatively

1207
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
Go ahead, say whatever you want.

1208
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
A document showing someone born in 2002,

1209
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,480
with no blood relation,

1210
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,640
a male identification,

1211
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,200
was purchased in 2020.

1212
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,320
Right? So when he

1213
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,480
enrolled in 2020,

1214
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,640
he faked an identity

1215
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,240
and enrolled with us.

1216
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,440
Yes, he started school on September 20th.

1217
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,120
I wanted to mention

1218
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
a very solid piece of evidence.

1219
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,480
I want to point out that it's him.

1220
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,240
Go ahead, let's hear it.

1221
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,520
Tell us, make your case as convincing as possible.

1222
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,000
We just went to Aguai's room.

1223
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,560
Let's start with the premise that

1224
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,040
Aguai replaced Jin Pengyou.

1225
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,640
When he turned eighteen,

1226
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,400
he came into this world

1227
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,280
and started school with us.

1228
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,680
Yes.

1229
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,360
Right.

1230
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
So in his previous world,

1231
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
he was always in that room.

1232
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:58,880
Yes.

1233
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
He doesn't know anything about the outside world.

1234
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
That's right.

1235
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,640
But his room is full of fairy tale books.

1236
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,080
Yes.

1237
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,560
Yes.

1238
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,080
For example,

1239
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,280
if I had been locked up for eighteen years,

1240
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,000
and entered society for the first time after eighteen years,

1241
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,160
and all I had read were fairy tales,

1242
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
what name would I give myself?

1243
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,280
Prince Charming.

1244
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,760
Highlight

1245
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,480
Whether he is or not

1246
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,880
I think this whole thing is very

1247
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,920
Right?

1248
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,480
There are fairy tale books in his room

1249
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,120
So all the characters he draws are from fairy tales

1250
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,000
The same logic applies, actually, the same logic

1251
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,520
But I didn't think of the Prince Charming angle

1252
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,280
And also

1253
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,160
What's the name of your orphanage?

1254
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,280
My orphanage is called Fairy Tale Orphanage

1255
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,240
What can you do about it?

1256
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,680
What can you do to me?

1257
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay.

1258
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
I lean more towards him.

1259
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
I think this is

1260
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,560
a fairy tale in your head.

1261
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,120
Really?

1262
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,440
Really?

1263
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
You stepped on me.

1264
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,400
I stepped on you.

1265
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
You stepped on me. Step.

1266
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,840
I will definitely step on you.

1267
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,200
You step.

1268
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,560
This, I think it's just

1269
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,600
this evidence isn't as

1270
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
solid as the previous one.

1271
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,240
Okay, you have a photo from the orphanage.

1272
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
Okay, I'll give you solid evidence.

1273
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,240
Alright, go ahead.

1274
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,480
Speak.

1275
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,360
When I was telling my story,

1276
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,680
did I say

1277
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,800
I wanted to work hard to become what?

1278
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
So that the parents who abandoned me

1279
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
would regret abandoning me.

1280
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,320
A famous person.

1281
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,280
A famous what?

1282
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,400
Actor.

1283
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,880
Right.

1284
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,280
To become a

1285
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,480
Make my parents regret

1286
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
what they did back then

1287
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,720
Right

1288
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,680
So what's Jin Guai's goal?

1289
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Director

1290
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,120
That's right

1291
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,280
Buddy, to become a blockbuster director

1292
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,720
So does that mean I'm

1293
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,600
safe now?

1294
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,600
No, I mean

1295
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,360
who exactly

1296
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,840
told whom

1297
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
"You have to be a director"

1298
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,560
Whose dream is it to be a director anyway?

1299
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
If being a director is Jin Guai's dream

1300
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,280
then it has nothing to do with A Guai wanting to be an actor

1301
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
Got into the acting department

1302
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,680
The one who wants to be an actor is A Guai

1303
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,880
Alright, then

1304
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,760
I'm stuck again

1305
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,920
If you put it that way

1306
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,160
you've been pulled back in

1307
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Now I actually think

1308
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,960
Ke is more suspicious

1309
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
Why?

1310
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,360
What do you mean?

1311
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,600
He's always being reasonable

1312
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,760
But he doesn't have you

1313
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,440
Who do you think it is?

1314
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,120
I think it's him

1315
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,680
Why

1316
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
He went through that cross-dressing

1317
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
then pulled this person down

1318
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,640
and played a role

1319
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,920
then came back here

1320
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,960
then he played the cross-dressing role

1321
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,560
then he played the skin-changing role

1322
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,800
then he played this one again

1323
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,760
It's because he returned with a new identity

1324
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,640
What kind of ghost was he before

1325
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,920
Skin-changing ghost

1326
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,680
Right, I dressed as a woman

1327
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,400
So he's very familiar

1328
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,480
with this skin-changing lifestyle

1329
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,120
In his life path

1330
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,640
this thing keeps happening

1331
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,240
Do you understand what I mean

1332
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,120
Aguai also bought a fake identity

1333
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,240
and lives like that

1334
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,680
You always

1335
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes

1336
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,600
Today's main logic

1337
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,360
is living by changing identities

1338
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,760
Living by changing identities

1339
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,200
It's like we live with someone else's face

1340
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,440
in this world

1341
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,600
So besides my own life

1342
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
my real life

1343
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,120
I would definitely use this skill too

1344
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,320
Alright, Skin-Changing Ghost.

1345
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,760
I vote for him. I already thought it was him.

1346
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,640
No.

1347
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,520
No, you're really twisting the facts.

1348
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,160
How am I twisting the facts?

1349
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,360
The way he does things,

1350
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,160
is always taking the blame, changing faces, pretending.

1351
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,840
Right.

1352
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,120
He got the Art Star title by pretending.

1353
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,640
Right.

1354
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,600
No, she was just disguising herself as a man.

1355
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,560
With that Art Star person...

1356
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,800
Maybe she chatted with the person who got the Art Star title.

1357
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,280
What does this have to do with Jin?

1358
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,120
Tell me, what's the connection?

1359
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Don't let him lead you on.

1360
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,480
If I were Aguai,

1361
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,080
I would have disguised myself as a woman before.

1362
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,280
I would have used what's called "face-changing."

1363
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,720
I'm very skilled at this technique.

1364
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,440
After Jin replaced Aguai,

1365
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,920
why is it related to face-changing?

1366
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
What we need to discuss is, before the replacement,

1367
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,960
who resembled Aguai more?

1368
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,280
And after the replacement,

1369
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,000
who has Jin's characteristics?

1370
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,520
How do we figure that out?

1371
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,080
I think it's him.

1372
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,400
Why?

1373
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,080
Because none of us can be sure

1374
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,680
about any one person.

1375
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,480
He latched onto one detail

1376
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,680
and kept attacking him for it.

1377
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,600
No.

1378
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,840
When it was just the two of us left to choose from,

1379
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,800
we debated each other.

1380
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
There's nothing wrong with that.

1381
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,880
Why do you think it was just between you two?

1382
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,320
Why?

1383
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,600
We've already ruled you out, right?

1384
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,320
We've already ruled him out, right?

1385
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,600
Why are you sure he's ruled out?

1386
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,640
Not anymore.

1387
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,440
I think only the culprit can be sure.

1388
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,760
Both people have been ruled out.

1389
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Live push today

1390
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,000
Live push today

1391
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,720
It's not a live push

1392
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,400
This one definitely

1393
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,800
will reveal some kind of logic

1394
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,600
This push is good for us now

1395
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,960
She's just an enthusiastic netizen, right?

1396
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,920
Let's go look for evidence about Shi Xisheng

1397
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,520
Maybe we can use the account

1398
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,680
to figure out this person's

1399
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,000
Right, her name is Shi Xisheng

1400
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,400
Let's go

1401
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,120
Online chat

1402
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,880
Where has this ever come up?

1403
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
I've heard of it

1404
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,720
There's Shi Xisheng

1405
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,760
What, are you afraid we'll find Shi Xisheng?

1406
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,800
This is Shi Xisheng, right?

1407
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,160
This phone call.

1408
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,520
Yes.

1409
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,360
The one with the phone.

1410
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,320
Aguai.

1411
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,080
This person is chatting with Aguai.

1412
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,880
Yes, she's Aguai's close friend.

1413
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,200
Aguai said, "I'm so envious."

1414
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,760
I must become a star in Tuiyi too.

1415
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,840
Go for it, you can do it!

1416
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,520
Let me tell you a little secret.

1417
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,080
I want to fall in love.

1418
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,080
Best wishes to you, my friend.

1419
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,840
I hope you can have

1420
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,600
a sweet romance.

1421
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,320
This was in January 2023.

1422
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,000
That was a long time ago.

1423
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,760
This is the end of 2023.

1424
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,840
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

1425
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,000
I've been feeling down.

1426
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,600
My friend,

1427
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,960
don't carry such a heavy burden.

1428
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,080
I'll always cheer you on.

1429
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,480
I hope your mood every day

1430
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,560
can be as bright as the winter sun.

1431
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,680
Aguai said a few days ago,

1432
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,360
a friend accidentally

1433
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
gave me a cut on my hand.

1434
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,480
I was afraid my friend would get scolded by the teacher.

1435
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,600
So I drew a sun to cover the wound.

1436
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,920
Yes.

1437
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,160
Are you better now?

1438
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,240
Don't worry, it's already healed.

1439
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,080
The wound

1440
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,840
left a scar.

1441
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,080
That's not right.

1442
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,320
In 2022, I said

1443
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,360
I must become the Star of Deduction.

1444
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,520
So that was in 2022.

1445
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,320
Not yet.

1446
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,200
Which year were you the Star of Deduction?

1447
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,760
I was in 2022. I eliminated myself.

1448
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,920
Go straight to locking the culprit.

1449
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,920
I eliminated (myself).

1450
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,880
I was the Star of Deduction in 2022.

1451
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,080
What date was the Star of Deduction chosen?

1452
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,920
June 3rd.

1453
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,200
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

1454
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,160
Okay.

1455
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,360
What, you're locking me again?

1456
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,360
You found a key clue and eliminated yourself.

1457
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,480
I just realized that.

1458
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,160
I didn't see the date.

1459
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,240
I don't know when it was chosen.

1460
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,640
That's right, our classic one-out-of-two choice.

1461
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,080
That's right, this line of thinking is correct.

1462
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,040
But this...

1463
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,440
Wants to fall in love.

1464
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,520
That's nonsense, isn't it?

1465
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,880
Yeah.

1466
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,080
Alright, then I'll clear myself.

1467
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,560
I'm clearing myself.

1468
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
This eliminates him.

1469
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,480
Why?

1470
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,840
Because I've been in a relationship with him for a long time.

1471
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,200
He can't pretend he wasn't.

1472
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,000
Why would he bother?

1473
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,480
He's my lovesick fool.

1474
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,640
I'm the lovesick fool.

1475
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,800
Yeah.

1476
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,160
What's wrong? I never wanted to date anyone.

1477
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,880
I'm cross-dressing.

1478
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,960
Okay.

1479
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,480
Okay.

1480
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,320
Alright.

1481
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,880
If you confess yourself,

1482
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,040
If you admit it,

1483
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,840
Admitting defeat is only half-losing.

1484
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,320
I...

1485
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,640
I'm not, why should I admit anything?

1486
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,640
He doesn't even look like it.

1487
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,840
It doesn't matter if he looks like it or not.

1488
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,280
All the evidence points here.

1489
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,640
What does it matter if it looks like it or not?

1490
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,600
What evidence is there?

1491
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,000
Tell me.

1492
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,440
What evidence points to me?

1493
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,120
We used the process of elimination.

1494
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,600
Right.

1495
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,720
We didn't find anything that directly identifies the culprit.

1496
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,160
Not a single direct piece of evidence.

1497
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,040
But through rounds of reasoning,

1498
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,280
We eliminate one person each round.

1499
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,840
One person per round.

1500
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,880
One person per round.

1501
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,960
And with each round of elimination,

1502
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,920
we vote for him.

1503
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,840
I think there is.

1504
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,640
I think this sentence could be about me.

1505
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,560
Let me prove myself first.

1506
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,480
Go ahead.

1507
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,800
I said I was so envious.

1508
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,720
I will definitely become the Star of Art Promotion.

1509
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,920
So, May 6th then.

1510
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,560
One month later.

1511
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,520
Isn't that when the Star of Art Promotion selection happens?

1512
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,600
Back in 2022,

1513
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,280
I became the Star of Art Promotion.

1514
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,840
She is my close friend.

1515
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,000
On May 6th,

1516
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,560
I told her I would definitely become the Star of Art Promotion.

1517
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,320
I understand his logic now.

1518
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,360
I expressed this to her.

1519
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,520
So why, after I became it,

1520
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,000
did I not say anything to her?

1521
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,480
But what if this person isn't you?

1522
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,960
It's him.

1523
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,040
He didn't get it in 2022.

1524
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,000
Then why didn't he later

1525
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,440
this Star of Art Promotion

1526
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,280
tell him about it again?

1527
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,080
Right.

1528
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,840
Think about it.

1529
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,400
When he got the Star of Art Promotion that year,

1530
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,640
he actually used

1531
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,600
underhanded tactics.

1532
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,640
He made the original

1533
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Star of Art Promotion step down,

1534
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,560
and took the title for himself that year.

1535
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,360
He dressed as a woman to drag someone else down.

1536
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,880
He used the last month's public opinion period

1537
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,560
Let's vote.

1538
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,520
Let's vote.

1539
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,000
Vote.

1540
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,720
Vote, vote for me, vote for me.

1541
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,000
It's just you now.

1542
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,560
It's just you now.

1543
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,680
Today's prime suspect

1544
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,760
I choose He

1545
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,160
The motive for the crime is revenge

1546
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,960
The crime involved the use of a virus

1547
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,120
The suspect I have identified is

1548
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,440
Did you, being so smart, notice it?

1549
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,400
It's a tough choice

1550
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,880
Because my choice is between two people

1551
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,040
It's between

1552
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,960
Prince Charming and Ke

1553
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,160
These two people

1554
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,480
In my mind, it's a choice between these two

1555
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,760
The one I chose today

1556
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,200
as the prime suspect is

1557
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,560
Today, my prime suspect is

1558
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,520
In my mind

1559
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,840
Ke and He

1560
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,960
are the most suspicious

1561
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,320
So I cast my vote for

1562
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,320
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1563
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,680
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

1564
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,120
Next, let's move on to

1565
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,880
Tongcheng Travel

1566
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,720
the moment of truth

1567
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,280
Little culprit

1568
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,920
Okay

1569
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,840
Among today's suspects

1570
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,480
Three people received votes

1571
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,680
Those who received votes are

1572
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,840
Famous and well-known

1573
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,080
From the Ke class

1574
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,360
Prince Charming

1575
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Who voted for Bai?

1576
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
Guys, who voted for Bai? I want to know.

1577
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,520
I did.

1578
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,160
He accused me.

1579
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,240
If I don't vote for him, who else would I vote for?

1580
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,040
It's fine, just announce it.

1581
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,640
Go ahead and announce it.

1582
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,280
Two players received one vote each.

1583
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,120
Besides that,

1584
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,360
there is another player

1585
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,480
who received three votes.

1586
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,120
That is...

1587
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,280
Let me count the votes.

1588
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,440
Who got three votes?

1589
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
I voted for Ke.

1590
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,520
I voted for Ke.

1591
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,840
So Ke has three votes.

1592
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,600
What? I got three votes?

1593
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,960
He voted for him.

1594
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I voted for you.

1595
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,640
I voted for you.

1596
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,760
Right.

1597
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,120
If you play like this,

1598
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,160
you're really impressive.

1599
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm telling you,

1600
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,640
Is it really that amazing?

1601
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,760
He can't hide his happiness.

1602
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,480
Look at how you're smiling.

1603
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,240
I'm speechless.

1604
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,960
No, wait a second.

1605
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,560
Announce it.

1606
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,640
Announce it.

1607
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,880
The player who received three votes is

1608
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,040
Famous and well-known.

1609
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,920
I'm a top brand.

1610
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,440
I'm voting for He.

1611
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,080
Today, my choice for the real culprit is

1612
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,640
He

1613
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
I choose He.

1614
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,960
It's because of Ke's behavior at the end.

1615
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,480
I think he looks more like a killer.

1616
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,160
So I cast my vote for

1617
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,960
Ke.

1618
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,120
The real culprit is

1619
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,760
Prince Charming.

1620
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,160
He's been stepping on me the whole time.

1621
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,960
On the 22nd, I was in the bathroom.

1622
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
Taking care of my mouth.

1623
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,000
You're lying. I didn't see you.

1624
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,120
You're lying. I didn't see you.

1625
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,120
At my orphanage, we didn't have names.

1626
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,040
Show the evidence.

1627
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,160
Bring out the evidence and let us see.

1628
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,360
There's something wrong with him.

1629
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,160
It's him.

1630
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,600
I think this is just

1631
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,200
a fairy tale in your head.

1632
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,320
Really?

1633
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,280
You step on me, I step on you.

1634
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,880
You step on me, step.

1635
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,320
I have to step on you.

1636
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:07,840
You step.

1637
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,080
It doesn't matter if it looks like it or not.

1638
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,560
All the evidence points here.

1639
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,160
What does it matter if it looks like it or not?

1640
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,880
What evidence is there?

1641
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,280
Tell me.

1642
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,640
What evidence points to me?

1643
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,840
If you confess yourself,

1644
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,720
admitting defeat is only half a loss.

1645
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,360
You, me—

1646
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,480
I'm not.

1647
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,360
What am I supposed to admit?

1648
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,520
Everyone, let's all vote for him with me.

1649
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,320
He's the killer.

1650
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,560
As a man,

1651
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,720
I can't swallow this insult.

1652
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,440
As a man,

1653
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,000
As a man,

1654
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,240
I can't swallow this insult.

1655
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,680
Since he stepped on me so hard,

1656
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,960
then I have to choose you.

1657
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,640
If anyone's going to lose face, let it be him.

1658
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,080
If he picks me today,

1659
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,920
it's not me.

1660
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,280
He'll be the most embarrassed one here.

1661
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,000
No, wait a second.

1662
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,400
How did he trample on your dignity today?

1663
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,360
I'd like to ask,

1664
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,520
he keeps targeting me.

1665
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,840
So what if he targets you?

1666
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,520
He targets all of us.

1667
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,280
That's how a killer acts.

1668
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,080
Let me tell you, Bai,

1669
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,760
seriously, if I'm not the killer,

1670
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,920
you'll be really embarrassed.

1671
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,760
It doesn't matter.

1672
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,360
But the reason I'm voting for you today

1673
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,360
is because you keep targeting me.

1674
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,160
For the sake of a man's dignity,

1675
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,240
I have to vote for you.

1676
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,320
That's a reasonable explanation.

1677
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,960
Explained like that, fine.

1678
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,320
Really

1679
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,680
Okay

1680
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,880
Is this even possible

1681
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,040
Alright

1682
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,480
Is this just a game of saving face

1683
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,920
A man's dignity can't be treated like this

1684
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,800
A man's dignity is more important than a golden key

1685
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,480
Is this just about appearances

1686
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,760
Then the vote was still correct

1687
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,800
Right, our votes are still with him

1688
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,560
Then who else voted for him

1689
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,280
You voted for me

1690
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,320
You two, you

1691
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,760
Three votes went to me

1692
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,800
I didn't vote for him

1693
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,000
I didn't vote for you either

1694
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,320
Impossible

1695
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,560
How is that possible

1696
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm really getting goosebumps

1697
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,480
Who's still messing around

1698
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,280
Next

1699
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,080
Let's announce to everyone

1700
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Did we successfully identify the culprit

1701
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,680
Let's see whose hypocritical mask comes off

1702
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,400
I'm ready to hit you

1703
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,320
Why would you hit me

1704
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,680
If I voted wrong, I'll hit you

1705
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,200
If you voted wrong, it has nothing to do with me

1706
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,280
No

1707
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,560
This round

1708
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,880
Go ahead, say it

1709
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,400
This game

1710
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,120
Wait a moment

1711
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,360
Who is that?

1712
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,560
You

1713
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,840
You're still acting

1714
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,720
No

1715
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,000
That's not right

1716
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,800
The real culprit is

1717
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,920
No

1718
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,120
That's not right

1719
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,760
Wait a moment

1720
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,280
He

1721
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,800
Isn't

1722
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,400
Wait a moment

1723
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,320
Let him say it

1724
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,080
Let him speak

1725
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,160
Let him speak

1726
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,400
Let him speak

1727
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,200
Let him speak

1728
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,960
Sure, no problem

1729
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,360
I'm letting him speak now

1730
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,680
I'm letting him speak

1731
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,720
He

1732
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,960
The real culprit is

1733
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,040
From the acting class

1734
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,960
I'm speechless

1735
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,920
You played so well

1736
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,320
You played so well

1737
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,600
Wait, who did you vote for?

1738
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,160
I said I'd vote for him, so I did

1739
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,720
He has two votes, right?

1740
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,000
He has double voting rights

1741
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,320
He has two votes

1742
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,320
Double vote

1743
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,160
Let me tell you today

1744
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,360
I'm the dumbest one

1745
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,800
I'm the worst one

1746
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,640
Why?

1747
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,520
Because I'm his X

1748
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,880
You're X

1749
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,240
That was really fun.

1750
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,520
She isn't Ba's X.

1751
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,840
She could even become the killer's X.

1752
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,720
No.

1753
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,040
Ba—I'm really not Ba's X at all.

1754
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,040
I made it up.

1755
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,600
She was never Ba's X in the first place.

1756
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,000
She just made it all up herself.

1757
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,160
And we believed it.

1758
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,040
I didn't know you could play it like that.

1759
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,320
No.

1760
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,960
Because when the two of us talked back then,

1761
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,880
she told me she wanted to play it this way.

1762
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,000
I said, "Are you crazy?"

1763
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,640
Do you take them for fools?

1764
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,680
Do you take them for fools?

1765
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,200
Because you all completely stopped considering

1766
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,960
the possibility that I was X.

1767
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,440
Yeah, you totally ruled it out.

1768
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,280
Yeah.

1769
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,240
And I only dared to do this after Ba left.

1770
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,000
She really played it well.

1771
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,440
Yeah, she played well.

1772
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,520
The person hitting the wall.

1773
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,480
You secretly opened your eyes.

1774
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,680
Can I not say it?

1775
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,400
Someone opened their eyes during that eye-opening game just now.

1776
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,120
It was Aba.

1777
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,520
Right?

1778
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,240
Yeah.

1779
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,600
I knew she was the killer all along.

1780
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,720
Because I was the X she chose for this case.

1781
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,520
Let's start with a premise.

1782
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,080
Aguai took Jin Pengyou's place.

1783
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,400
He came to this world when he was eighteen.

1784
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,240
Let's go to school together.

1785
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah.

1786
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,040
For example, say I was imprisoned for eighteen years.

1787
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,680
After eighteen years, I step into society for the first time.

1788
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,920
All I've ever read are fairy tales.

1789
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,360
What name should I give myself?

1790
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,680
Prince Charming.

1791
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,520
Highlight.

1792
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,760
I think that's just a fairy tale in your head.

1793
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,880
Really?

1794
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,480
You stepped on me.

1795
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,600
I stepped on you.

1796
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
You stepped on me. Stepped.

1797
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,840
I have to step on you.

1798
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,440
You step.

1799
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,200
I think it's him.

1800
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,880
What kind of ghost was he before?

1801
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,040
The Painted Skin Ghost.

1802
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,960
So he's very familiar

1803
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,240
with the lifestyle of the Painted Skin.

1804
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,680
In his life trajectory,

1805
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,280
this thing keeps happening.

1806
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,240
Do you get what I mean?

1807
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,840
Alright, Painted Skin Ghost.

1808
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,240
I vote for him.

1809
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,280
I was going to vote for him too.

1810
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,240
The year 2022.

1811
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,520
Said I must become the Star of Deduction.

1812
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,720
That was in 2022.

1813
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,480
Not yet.

1814
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,360
Which year were you the Star of Deduction?

1815
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,240
I was in 2022.

1816
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,200
I eliminated it.

1817
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,600
What date did we choose the Star of Deduction?

1818
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,080
June 3rd.

1819
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,480
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

1820
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,520
But as for this one,

1821
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,640
wants to fall in love.

1822
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,880
That's nonsense, right?

1823
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,600
Right.

1824
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,000
Eliminate this one.

1825
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,640
Why?

1826
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Because I've already been in a relationship with him for a long time.

1827
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,240
Sorry.

1828
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,400
I lied to you. I was really under a lot of stress.

1829
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,960
It's okay, it's okay.

1830
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,440
The time I started dating him was

1831
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,080
on Valentine's Day in 2023.

1832
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,320
It was in 2023.

1833
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,200
Love at first sight.

1834
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,840
Then I confessed my feelings to her.

1835
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,240
After that, the two of us happily

1836
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,120
got together.

1837
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,040
So he couldn't possibly get out of it.

1838
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,000
We had just made up.

1839
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,440
It wasn't easy for us to be together.

1840
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
It's all right.

1841
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,640
I think it's fine.

1842
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,400
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

1843
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,440
I was completely fooled.

1844
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,040
I'm speechless.

1845
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,680
Lao Bai, where do you think you went wrong?

1846
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,680
Bai, say something.

1847
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,360
Reflect on where your problem is right now.

1848
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,240
My problem

1849
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,160
is with myself.

1850
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,680
I'll just go back and reflect on it myself.

1851
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,200
Blame me.

1852
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,240
It's not your fault.

1853
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,440
That was close.

1854
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,400
Fortune favors the bold.

1855
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,440
You two, stand together. Stand together.

1856
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,120
Actually, he was planning to target me today.

1857
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,920
What the two of us discussed

1858
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,320
was a strategy against him.

1859
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,440
It was all for him to see.

1860
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:57,920
Right.

1861
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,840
It's because we're afraid of him.

1862
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,360
So the two of us have to keep this up.

1863
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Because he said this could be shown to you.

1864
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,320
But as for your two votes,

1865
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,880
I actually only need one vote.

1866
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,320
If I get his and his vote,

1867
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,240
that's actually enough.

1868
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,160
Okay.

1869
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,880
What is the key evidence?

1870
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,720
The key evidence is a chain of logic.

1871
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,600
In the palm of the victim's right hand

1872
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,520
there is a bloodstain in the shape of a sun.

1873
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,880
The victim, Aguai, once mentioned to Tuihao during a chat

1874
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,680
that in order to help a friend avoid blame,

1875
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,960
he turned a wound caused by his friend into a sun shape.

1876
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,480
The same thing happened this time.

1877
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,880
When the killer committed the murder,

1878
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,160
they first knocked Aguai unconscious.

1879
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
They took off their own extra's costume

1880
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,440
and swapped all of Aguai's clothes with theirs.

1881
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,200
This included clothes, pants, shoes, and accessories.

1882
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,120
Unexpectedly, Aguai woke up early.

1883
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,800
The killer immediately acted and killed him.

1884
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,880
As a result, they left behind the Tuiyi Outstanding Graduate bracelet.

1885
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,360
At this moment,

1886
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,960
the ring on the killer's hand

1887
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,640
scratched Aguai's palm,

1888
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,200
leaving a bloodstain.

1889
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,840
Afterwards, the killer destroyed other evidence and left.

1890
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,800
At this point, Aguai was not yet dead.

1891
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,680
He knew he didn't have much time left.

1892
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,200
Worried that his own ring

1893
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,320
would become the key

1894
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,200
evidence implicating his friend instead of himself,

1895
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,400
out of guilt towards his friend Jin,

1896
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,560
he used a piece of broken porcelain

1897
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,200
to add more cuts to the bloodstain left by the ring,

1898
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,560
making several more wounds,

1899
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,680
turning it into a sun pattern.

1900
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,680
He also wrote on a stone

1901
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,720
to leave a message saying "I'm sorry."

1902
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,320
After Jin, pretending to be Aguai, returned to the lounge,

1903
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,280
he took off the ring,

1904
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,680
did some simple makeup,

1905
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,720
and at 13:30 on the 22nd,

1906
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,720
blended in with everyone on time.

1907
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,120
Stop talking nonsense.

1908
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,640
Hurry up and give me the long-awaited golden key.

1909
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Here it is.

1910
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,800
Come on.

1911
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,480
This one.

1912
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,560
You give it out.

1913
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,120
I forcibly gave their keys to you two.

1914
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,600
No, not like that.

1915
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,320
You give it to him.

1916
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,000
You give it to him.

1917
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,320
Alright.

1918
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,480
Because it's a choice between you two.

1919
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,080
I'll give it to Jin.

1920
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,240
Okay.

1921
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,520
But you really played well today.

1922
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,840
Bro, you really played amazingly.

1923
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,960
You truly deserve it.

1924
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,040
Even when I was like that,

1925
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,680
you weren't affected by me at all.

1926
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,200
You really played well today.

1927
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,880
No, you played well.

1928
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,440
Bro, you really played amazingly.

1929
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,160
You truly deserve it.

1930
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,640
Okay.

1931
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,440
I'll take these four keys for now.

1932
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,080
Forty hours have passed.

1933
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,280
Did you find any suspicious points this time?

1934
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,600
Were there any suspicious people?

1935
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,400
Didn't we see that person today?

1936
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,680
That person in black?

1937
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,040
He was holding something like a box.

1938
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
Inside the box was a house.

1939
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,040
And there was a small yard or something.

1940
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,320
It felt like a home.

1941
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,040
It was supposed to be placed there.

1942
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
There's one more thing.

1943
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,880
What is it?

1944
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,840
We have some news.

1945
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,480
It says they're investigating the Tuitian Food Factory.

1946
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,400
In that notebook,

1947
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,360
it says seven people died.

1948
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,520
There was an explosion at the Tuitian Food Factory next door.

1949
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,120
According to the boss's request,

1950
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,800
we went next door to patrol and investigate.

1951
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,560
Seven bodies were carried out from the factory.

1952
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,560
That person named An Wenzhe

1953
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,080
should have died inside.

1954
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,040
But he wasn't there.

1955
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,320
That's right, the missing body.

1956
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,400
An Wenzhe's body was missing.

1957
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,000
Yes.

1958
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,720
Why would someone steal a body?

1959
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,000
There was surveillance of us on a bulldozer.

1960
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,240
Someone is watching us, right?

1961
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,160
And there was a black cloak.

1962
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,760
Yes.

1963
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,800
Someone is secretly filming us in daily life.

1964
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,680
They're keeping an eye on us.

1965
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,600
Right.

1966
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,360
It should be that person.

1967
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,800
The one in the black robe who stole that box.

1968
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,120
You've killed two people in a row.

1969
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,520
And still haven't shown up.

1970
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,800
If you keep this up, you'll get caught.

1971
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,720
I really feel a bit...

1972
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,400
Tonight, there's finally someone who can't sleep.

1973
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,680
So, did you find the bomb this time?

1974
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,360
There was no bomb.

1975
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,160
No bomb appeared this time.

1976
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,680
We won't get blown up again, will we?

1977
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,760
Is there going to be another explosion?

1978
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,080
Then maybe we should look for the office first this time.

1979
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,760
There's a bomb on the wall.

1980
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,640
On the wall, above your head.

1981
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,320
Above your head.

1982
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,200
This one.

1983
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,960
This.

1984
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,040
This one.

1985
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,680
Ten-minute countdown.

1986
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,720
I found the first one.

1987
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,440
Yeah.

1988
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:49,840
This.

1989
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,280
Let's all look for the differences.

1990
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,080
Come on, look.

1991
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,280
Each of us takes one.

1992
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,120
What does "look right in the middle, look left" mean?

1993
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,560
Find a watermelon seed among the sunflower seeds.

1994
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm looking for a cobra.

1995
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,800
Among all the snakes.

1996
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,240
Are we looking for a snake with glasses?

1997
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,920
Find a tomato among the kumquats.

1998
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,480
I found it.

1999
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,640
Guys, I found it.

2000
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Twenty-nine.

2001
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,920
What? Can we poke it open?

2002
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,840
It's been cut.

2003
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay, now look for this one.

2004
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,880
This one looks to the left.

2005
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,520
Which one is it? Are you sure?

2006
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,320
Is it fifty-five?

2007
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,200
Are you sure? Fifty-five?

2008
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,840
Fifty-five. Okay, cut it.

2009
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,520
Is this a watermelon seed?

2010
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,760
Why?

2011
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,800
Isn't it right here?

2012
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,560
Yes, that's it.

2013
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,880
Good job finding it, Fifteen.

2014
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,440
Guys, my eyes are already tired.

2015
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,600
Okay, then I'll go look for yours. Come on.

2016
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,160
I'm tired.

2017
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,280
I'll help you look for this one.

2018
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,000
Are we looking for a tomato among the kumquats?

2019
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,160
Yes.

2020
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:27,960
I'm coming.

2021
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,560
There's more here.

2022
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,600
Who are we looking for in the pile?

2023
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,640
Looking for a frog among the leaves.

2024
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,800
Who?

2025
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,480
Here.

2026
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,360
Found this one, twenty.

2027
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,560
Twenty.

2028
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,000
Is there a wire inside?

2029
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,360
There is a wire.

2030
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,800
There's a wire, cut it.

2031
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,160
Frog.

2032
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,560
Frog.

2033
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,520
Seven minutes left.

2034
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,560
The frog is here.

2035
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,320
Thirty-five.

2036
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,640
Only one left, right?

2037
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,040
Dude, shouldn't tomatoes be red?

2038
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,440
Why?

2039
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,840
How are kumquats and tomatoes...

2040
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
...different in appearance?

2041
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,880
Let me ask.

2042
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,480
The tomato's leaves are different.

2043
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,640
The leaves?

2044
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,520
Yes, the leaves.

2045
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
Wait a second.

2046
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,720
Which one do you think it is, bro?

2047
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,440
Then it should be this one, right?

2048
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,160
Here it is.

2049
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:27,800
Here.

2050
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,760
I see it.

2051
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,640
Nice.

2052
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,440
Cut it.

2053
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,640
Congratulations.

2054
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,240
You successfully stopped the explosion.

2055
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,640
This is our first time saving the world successfully.

2056
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,080
We finally don't have to die.

2057
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,320
Next,

2058
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,080
I will send you

2059
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,320
to be reborn in a new place.

2060
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,200
That place is called Goodhouse.

2061
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,480
Good luck to you.

2062
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,480
Actually, in today's story,

2063
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,600
we all played

2064
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,080
the role of a toxic friend.

2065
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,280
When we have problems ourselves,

2066
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,400
we vent them onto you.

2067
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,200
We transfer all our negative emotions to you.

2068
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,840
Or we treat you

2069
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,920
as a tool to boost our own ego.

2070
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,040
We gain false confidence by putting you down.

2071
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,520
To fill the deep sense of inferiority inside.

2072
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,720
If

2073
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,520
you encounter such friends,

2074
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,840
I hope you can learn to cut your losses in time.

2075
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,760
And have the courage to walk away.

2076
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Through this episode,

2077
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,000
I think everyone should be able to

2078
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,280
understand what true friendship

2079
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,440
should really be like and how to maintain it.

2080
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,520
I believe that if you want to

2081
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,000
gain benefits from your friend

2082
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,280
or if

2083
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,280
every time you face difficulties, you want to hide behind

2084
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,560
your friend, then this kind of friendship

2085
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,600
definitely won't last long.

2086
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,440
Because deep down, you don't really

2087
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,680
have a sincere attitude

2088
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,440
towards being a true friend to them.

2089
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,760
I think a good friend should be

2090
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,800
someone who reaches out a helping hand in difficult times,

2091
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,080
and when

2092
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,400
good things happen to them, sincerely offers blessings.

2093
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,960
Treating each other sincerely

2094
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,480
is the best way to get along.

2095
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,720
In this story,

2096
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,320
Aguai, in order to gain his own life

2097
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
and his own freedom,

2098
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,800
ended up betraying his friend

2099
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,000
and made his friend take his place,

2100
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,880
living in

2101
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,560
an environment of captivity.

2102
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,280
This actually happens in our daily lives

2103
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,320
This is typical behavior of a toxic friend

2104
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,680
Some friends will

2105
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,320
try to control you with their emotions

2106
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,760
If you encounter someone like this

2107
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,920
you must stay away from them

2108
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,720
Never let your own emotions

2109
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,280
bottle up inside you

2110
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,720
This will only make your

2111
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,080
state worse and worse

2112
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,760
You must learn to say no

2113
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,320
Remove toxic friends from your life

2114
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,480
Get rid of those

2115
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,680
who cause you to accumulate negative emotions

2116
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,440
Your life will get better and better

2117
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,720
I think

2118
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,520
there's no need to let one bad thing

2119
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,600
or one bad person

2120
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,360
make you think the world

2121
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,920
are all malicious toward you.

2122
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,560
If you always, because of one thing,

2123
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,360
or one person,

2124
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,400
completely shut yourself off,

2125
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:00,800
then you

2126
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,760
are not punishing that person,

2127
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,000
you are punishing yourself.

2128
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,880
I think people always need to grow.

2129
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,200
We learn from our mistakes.

2130
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,440
I think the most important thing

2131
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,040
is also to protect yourself.

2132
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,680
Close relationships

2133
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,560
require us to nurture them sincerely.

2134
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,120
Every relationship

2135
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,480
should not be taken for granted.

2136
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,080
Maintaining the right distance keeps relationships comfortable over time.

2137
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,360
Balancing closeness and distance allows us to care for each other.

2138
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,400
If I think being friends

2139
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,200
is just about

2140
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,640
constantly seeking emotional value from them,

2141
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,800
and forcing the other person

2142
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,200
to fill your own sense of insecurity,

2143
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,480
that actually consumes the friendship in a negative way.

2144
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,600
When the friend you cherish

2145
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,280
becomes someone you use to patch up

2146
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,920
your own wounds,

2147
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,120
the relationship is bound to fall apart.

2148
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,920
I hope everyone can

2149
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,400
treat their friends sincerely

2150
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,080
and also gain sincere friends in return.

2151
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,960
We're here for "Let's Start Reasoning 3"!

2152
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,840
After the last recording, I told everyone

2153
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,440
that I even had withdrawal symptoms.

2154
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,000
I kept wondering when we would record again.

2155
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,560
And I thought

2156
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,800
I was the only one who felt this way.

2157
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,120
But it turns out Zhang Linghe felt the same.

2158
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,040
He kept asking me

2159
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,400
when our next recording would be.

2160
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,680
Let's go.

2161
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,560
Give me your hand.

2162
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,880
We are

2163
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,400
He Li, Mo, and Jin Yu.

2164
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,160
Three, two, one.

2165
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,920
You can do it!

2166
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,480
A Jin.

2167
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,680
A Ba.

2168
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,640
Take it slow.

2169
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,840
Alright?

2170
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,400
It's still okay.

2171
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,560
Like you're sitting.

2172
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,520
It's fine.

2173
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,200
Nothing will happen.

2174
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:26,800
Don't worry.

2175
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
Your foot is already on my head now.

2176
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:29,840
Okay.

2177
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,480
Come on.

2178
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,200
Keep going!

2179
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,480
Alright.

2180
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,360
We're here.

2181
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,840
Let go.

2182
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,440
Alright.

2183
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,040
It's fine.

2184
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,120
No problem.

2185
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,520
I'm also very grateful that on "Start Reasoning,"

2186
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,560
I made so many friends. Thank you all.

2187
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,680
I think we are truly

2188
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,200
healthy friends.

2189
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,840
At first, A-Guai was dependent on his friends

2190
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,920
He relied on them

2191
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,720
But it was a kind of unhealthy dependence

2192
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,320
For everything

2193
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,160
He wanted to stick with his friends all the time

2194
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,640
So gradually

2195
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,440
When he realized

2196
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,400
That he couldn't

2197
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,240
Make his friends do everything he wanted

2198
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,880
This dependence turned into control

2199
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,120
Because we always think

2200
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,160
That those close to us

2201
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,360
Should handle all of our emotions

2202
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,520
So we unconsciously reveal

2203
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,160
What we call our true selves

2204
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,040
To those we are close to

2205
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,400
We feel we can completely

2206
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,760
Show ourselves to them

2207
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,400
But

2208
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,240
We don't realize that showing everything at once

2209
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,600
Can actually hurt the other person

2210
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,240
So I'll share with you four

2211
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,640
Tips for getting along in close relationships

2212
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,200
The first technique

2213
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,320
is what we call "allowing differences."

2214
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,480
It means I am myself,

2215
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,040
and you are you—we are different people.

2216
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,840
It's because

2217
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,200
of our differences that we come together.

2218
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,480
The second technique is

2219
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,080
to pay attention to how we express ourselves.

2220
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,000
I've emphasized this many times:

2221
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,720
communication is extremely important.

2222
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,440
But communication must be honest.

2223
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,800
Honesty doesn't mean hurting the other person.

2224
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,480
It means sincerely expressing your own feelings.

2225
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,520
The third technique

2226
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,200
is that we need to create

2227
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,640
time for intimate conversations.

2228
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,160
The last technique

2229
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,520
I call being an "emotional recycler."

2230
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,000
Take back your emotions,

2231
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,600
and process and transform them.

2232
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,480
This is a very crucial step.

2233
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,240
Because we often say

2234
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,520
that when we're in the midst of things,

2235
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,880
we can't see clearly.

2236
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,120
So we really need the other person to help us

2237
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,920
by receiving our emotions

2238
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,440
and helping us sort them out together

2239
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,440
and transform them.

2240
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,000
Don't be an emotional trash can,

2241
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,600
but

2242
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,640
be an emotional recycler.

2243
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,040
These four techniques

2244
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,279
are what I really hope

2245
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:21,279
to share with everyone.

2246
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,680
The Gu Dehao Mansion

2247
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,000
After being vacant for over a month

2248
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,720
the lights are all on

2249
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,680
and shadows of ghosts linger everywhere

2250
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,120
Is this a sign of the painted wall

2251
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,160
or restless spirits that can't move on?

2252
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,399
This house

2253
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,399
is not clean

2254
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,760
All of you, come here

2255
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,399
This place is so strange, it's not like in the painting

2256
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,279
Didn't your child die?

2257
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,040
No

2258
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:51,920
She

2259
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,439
is in the world inside the painting

2260
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,359
Sister, I'm your real younger sister

2261
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,319
I lost my memory three months ago

2262
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:00,160
Who am I? Who are you?

2263
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,200
How would I know who you are?

2264
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,960
Could this be the three of us as a family?

2265
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,160
Why did you come here today?

2266
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,080
I don't remember anything

2267
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,439
How many people have lost their memories?

2268
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,680
We've actually already been trapped inside the painting

2269
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,359
But our stories seem a bit different

2270
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,479
The versions of us appearing now

2271
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,680
might be us reborn after the ritual to summon family

2272
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:22,040
She

2273
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:22,479
What?

2274
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,040
She committed suicide.

2275
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,640
Some memories suddenly resurfaced.

2276
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,520
An Wenzhe, we are not in parallel universes.

2277
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,760
We are traveling through time.

2278
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,880
An Wenzhe.

2279
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,800
Take them inside.

2280
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,399
Keep them separated.

2281
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,080
Save us.

2282
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:31,800
Save us.

2283
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:33,040
That's too cruel.

2284
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,760
What are you doing?

2285
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,560
Wait a moment.

2286
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,760
This...

2287
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,120
The ritual is to summon Good Baby back.

2288
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,600
What's her relationship with Good Baby?

2289
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,080
Proceed with caution.

2290
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,279
Everyone is empty.

2291
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,960
That means we've come out of the painting.

2292
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,399
Right?

2293
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,520
Our baby hasn't come back.

2294
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,560
Dad.

2295
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,680
Come out and play with me!

2296
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,640
This is so much fun.

2297
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,800
My name is Penyou.

2298
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,000
Looking at that face,

2299
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,520
years of suppressed hatred erupt at this moment.

2300
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,040
I want to take everything from him.

2301
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,000
Kill him and take his place.

2302
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,280
I saw that they have to meet at 12:30.

2303
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,440
I must hide myself well.

2304
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,200
Only then can I cleanly

2305
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,360
start a new life.

2306
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,600
Change your stance again.

2307
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,600
Squat down and scratch your head.

2308
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,880
No, move in a bit.

2309
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,480
Feels like the days when we wore hoods.

2310
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:20,960
Is it okay now?

2311
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,520
It's fine now.

2312
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,600
Mine is broken.

2313
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,760
The glue came off.

2314
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,680
It doesn't matter.

2315
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,600
Can I go in front?

2316
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,920
I want to eat sunflower seeds.

2317
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,200
I'm shaking so much my stomach hurts.

2318
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,200
Simple and easy.
