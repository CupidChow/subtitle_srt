1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,880
So cool.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Cool, looks great.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm speechless.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Looks great, really.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,400
Three, two, one.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,000
And turn around.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,720
Come on.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
Cool, that's good.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,880
But I still like that one.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,320
You should ride up on it.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,120
How do you ride this?

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,520
Yeah, just get on like that.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
How come they all have horses?

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,680
Why are there wheels?

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,880
His horse...

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,760
...can't fly.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,560
If you go faster, won't it fly?

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,120
Take the poster photo.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,960
Okay, sure.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,320
Get ready.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
Three, two, one, go.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
Okay.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Take a look.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,320
Look again.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
See if the effect is good.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay, let's check if it's good.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,000
Three, two, one, go.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,000
Cool.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm really speechless, really.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm leaving.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,160
So annoying.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,440
Three, two, one, go.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
Okay, stop.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
Let's replay it.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,880
Okay.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,160
Take a look.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,760
Three, two, one, go.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
Come on, get ready on set.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
Three, two, one, start.

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Sorry, let's do it again.

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,200
Three, two, one

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,560
Get ready, three, two, one

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Okay

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Looks good

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
Turn around so I can take a couple of photos

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,160
Turn on the flash

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
Can you make my wings look good in the photo?

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Then first, you need to do it like this

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,880
Right, you have to pose from head to toe

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,800
Hello, Ning

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,600
Hello

52
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Shoot a slow-motion shot

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,640
Alright

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
Get ready

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Start rolling

56
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
Three, two, one, go

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,000
Take a look

58
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
It went up my nose

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, it's too dense

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,200
It's fine

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Better turn around

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, that's good

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,960
Come on, that's it

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
Let's record

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Three, two, one, action

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
Take a look, come here

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,920
It's blocked

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,080
Okay

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Entangle me

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, good

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,440
So cool, teacher

72
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,160
That's good, thank you

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's shoot that slow-motion shot.

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
The one filmed with the robotic arm.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:33,920
Okay.

76
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
It's at this position.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,760
Then our main focus is

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,880
to look at this shot.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,840
Looking at the camera will look cool.

80
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,120
Two, one, go.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,760
Three, two, one, go.

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
Cool, take a look.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
Teacher, let's do one more.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,240
Let's do a glasses move.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
We can give you a glasses move.

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,800
Okay.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Just do it directly, come on.

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
Three, two, one, start.

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,880
Cool, that's good.

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,520
Alright, good job.

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,880
Done.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Cool.

93
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,400
You can start directly.

94
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
I want to do one.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,520
Alright.

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
A cooler move.

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
You can turn on the bubble machine.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,320
You can turn it on now.

99
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Okay, let's go.

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,360
Alright, let's go.

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Come on, try it once, come on.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,920
Record.

103
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,400
Recording.

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
Three, two, one, go.

105
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,120
Stop.

106
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,720
You can take a look.

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Let me show you.

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,560
Replay.

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,120
Let me show you.

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,680
Take a glance.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Once in a lifetime.

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,040
This is fun, right?

113
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
I've been to Hollywood too.

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,200
Right?

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,840
Too many bubbles.

116
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Come on, record.

117
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,320
Recording.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,440
Come on.

119
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
Three, two, one.

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,280
Go.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay, hold it a bit longer.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Alright.

124
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,760
This will definitely work.

125
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,680
Can I take a look? Just a peek?

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,320
Just a peek.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,880
Okay.

128
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,760
Alright.

129
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Cool.

130
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
This one is cool.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,520
Very cool.

132
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,480
But I still like that one.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
You should just ride it.

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
How do you ride this?

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,280
Yeah, just get on like that.

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,840
How come they all have horses?

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Why does his horse even have wheels?

138
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,600
You should carry this one.

139
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
This thing is always lying down.

140
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
No, I just want this one.

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,000
This one can fly.

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,680
His can't fly either.

143
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,040
Mine can actually walk.

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,360
Yeah.

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,160
This one can fly.

146
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,680
It can't fly.

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
Yours is the same as mine.

148
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,800
If you walk faster, won't it fly?

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
It feels like you're torturing it.

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,480
You know that, right?

151
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
At least mine can stand.

152
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
No, his can stand too.

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,640
Isn't this one standing too?

154
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,640
Yours looks like it's being dragged.

155
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,960
They're all kind of cruel.

156
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm speechless.

157
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,520
It's just a balloon, and you say I'm being cruel to it.

158
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,080
What's up with your assistant?

159
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,200
Just a high-end assistant.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
High-end assistant.

161
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,760
An assistant should keep a low profile.

162
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,440
I'll put on a mask in a bit.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
Pretend to be a celebrity, walking in front.

164
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
Jin Jing hasn't arrived yet, right?

165
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
She came, she's already finished filming.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
She didn't come here.

167
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
She came, right? That's fine then.

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,040
Yours is just not that one.

169
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,960
Mine is better than yours.

170
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,560
Yours isn't filled with hydrogen.

171
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,120
It's heavy, it has four wheels.

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
Because I have a stand.

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,560
It doesn't, what's inside is just...

174
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,800
It must be the same gas.

175
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,080
How could it be a different gas?

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
We're filling two balloons.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,480
This one is just heavy, that's all.

178
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
Who is this?

179
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,880
So handsome.

180
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay.

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,520
Dragonfly.

182
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,280
Flower fairy.

183
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,840
Elf.

184
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,280
Cool.

185
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,720
You take this.

186
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
I'll take this.

187
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Okay.

188
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,160
This one really works. You can shoot it.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
Why do you all have props and I don't?

190
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Because you're the assistant.

191
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,960
Sorry.

192
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Where did your assistant bag go?

193
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
Give it to me.

194
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Whose is this?

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
This is what Ba-jie used for that shot.

196
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,600
The opening shot.

197
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
You're giving me someone else's prop, seriously?

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,480
The prop I just took.

199
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Do you want to carry it on the red carpet?

200
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,120
Bow and arrow.

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
No, then I don't want it.

202
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,600
This thing is so heavy.

203
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,320
There are so many here.

204
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Here, you take this.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Whose is this now?

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,360
Whose is this?

207
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
I don't have any props.

208
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
You just have to give me one.

209
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,920
This is mine.

210
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Don't listen to him, he just—

211
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,640
This really is Ning's.

212
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,120
This is mine, it's mine.

213
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,720
Then what's the meaning of the one you're holding?

214
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,600
This is my prop.

215
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Yeah, he insisted on holding it.

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Alright, adding your own scenes.

217
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,520
That's what veteran actors do.

218
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,640
They give themselves props in the play.

219
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,520
To use as a pivot for their performance.

220
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
It makes it more charming.

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,120
Just like in life, right?

222
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,160
You're a bit too beautiful today.

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,640
Very soon.

224
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,800
Congratulations, I really want to see it.

225
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,600
Your song "Crush or Love"

226
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,480
How does it go?

227
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
How do you know about that?

228
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
Why can't I know?

229
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Can't I follow you?

230
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,200
You can.

231
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Sing it for me.

232
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,320
I can't, sorry.

233
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
Is it a crush or is it love?

234
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,080
A crush.

235
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,480
Letting you become part of my path forward.

236
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
Yeah, that's about right.

237
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,280
Yeah.

238
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,720
Then let's go back. Why are we just standing here?

239
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Is there something wrong with your ears or what?

240
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
You still haven't woken up yet.

241
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,440
Yesterday, the thunder was so loud,

242
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
my ears still feel a bit uncomfortable.

243
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
It really was so loud.

244
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Did you see it on the plane?

245
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
What time did you land?

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
I landed at 2:40.

247
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,600
Was it still thundering then?

248
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
There was no thunder when we landed.

249
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,480
But it was my first time seeing

250
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,040
the plane turn on a red light.

251
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,880
The light outside kept flashing.

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
Were you scared?

253
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
A little, because it was pretty shaky.

254
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,440
"To Our Eventually Fading Pimples"

255
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,240
Did you see this?

256
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,480
"Those Years We Chased the Girls"

257
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,840
"Those Years We Chased the Girls"

258
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,760
Its theme song is

259
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,680
"Sand Slope Wolf"

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,480
Ke Daole

261
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
"Sand Slope Wolf"

262
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,000
Ke Daole has sung so many songs.

263
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,320
One, two, three.

264
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,520
Is it good?

265
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
It's really good.

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,720
My "partner"

267
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,400
You're in a relationship?

268
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
This is my "partner."

269
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,800
I found someone who looks like me.

270
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,840
But the midface is a bit too long.

271
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
I think for girls,

272
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,480
Yesterday I almost picked an outfit

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,760
that was the same color as yours.

274
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,120
This one.

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,520
Isn't that nice?

276
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,240
But mine was too baggy, so I didn't wear it.

277
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,680
Everyone, move a little closer to my side.

278
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,960
Everyone? It's just the two of us.

279
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,760
You flew in last night, right?

280
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,120
What time was your flight?

281
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Seven o'clock.

282
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,320
I flew at seven.

283
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
It only took a little over an hour.

284
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,160
Where should I stand?

285
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Yes, stand right there.

286
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
It was just perfectly timed

287
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
for when it wasn't raining.

288
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,240
After I arrived, it hasn't stopped raining in Changsha.

289
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Didi.

290
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Okay, three, two, one.

291
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,800
Reba and Teacher Jin Jing,

292
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,880
could you both step a little forward?

293
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,360
Okay.

294
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,600
It's mainly because my wings are stuck.

295
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,120
It's fine.

296
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,240
Stop pushing me.

297
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
My face is already big.

298
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm purposely standing back.

299
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
Alright, got it.

300
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
Three, two, one.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
And everyone can

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
get a little closer together.

303
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Okay.

304
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes, good.

305
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,040
And look a bit happier.

306
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,680
Okay, who's not happy?

307
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Smile a bit more, come on.

308
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Zhou Keyu, don't look unhappy.

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
It's definitely not me.

310
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,840
Come on, look over here.

311
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Three, two, one.

312
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay.

313
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,880
Should we take a look at these posters?

314
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
Otherwise, their effort would be wasted, right?

315
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,280
No, not this one.

316
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,000
Who is this?

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,480
That's you.

318
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,040
This is...

319
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,880
Who's the female lead?

320
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,400
The female lead is Canary.

321
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
It's not you two.

322
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,400
It's your grandfather.

323
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,200
Oh, right.

324
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,280
So, it's our senior.

325
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
That's my grandma.

326
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
Not really.

327
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,280
It doesn't have to be our relative.

328
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,640
Um...

329
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,440
Family relationship.

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,000
We just had plastic surgery to look like them.

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,040
We just look a lot like them.

332
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,240
I feel like these two people in the future...

333
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,920
will be amazing.

334
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,560
Really amazing.

335
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,240
Truly amazing.

336
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,120
This one is called "Little Cherry Calf."

337
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,680
You acted in this one too, Canary.

338
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
You've acted in quite a few shows.

339
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,040
"Little Cherry Calf"

340
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,080
You acted in that one too.

341
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
To Our Eventually Lost...

342
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,760
Acne.

343
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,040
"Those Years We Hunted Down the Girl"

344
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
"As Tears Go By"

345
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
Ke Daole

346
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,680
In Carmen

347
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,160
Why don't you repeat what you said in the group this morning

348
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,080
the message you posted

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,800
say it again

350
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,040
What did I say this morning?

351
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,480
After I sent this

352
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
this poster of the female lead

353
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
what did you say?

354
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
What did I say?

355
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Why can't it be me?

356
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
It is me

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
Original music

358
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,440
You didn't act with her

359
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,600
I did

360
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
During rehearsals, it was always

361
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
me acting with her

362
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,520
Right

363
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,160
He was the stand-in

364
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,280
You only did stand-in work

365
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,680
Yeah

366
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,320
He only did stand-in

367
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,800
He was Ning Hao's stand-in

368
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,080
You two aren't the same either

369
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
So who is this female lead?

370
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,800
It's you two

371
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
How did you two end up acting in so many scenes?

372
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,359
Feels like they're acting for real

373
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
Maybe

374
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,720
Could be

375
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,119
We've worked together too

376
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,119
I acted in "Ghost Blows Out the Light"

377
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,160
You were in the seventeenth scene back then

378
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,720
Yeah

379
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,119
Only had one shot

380
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,720
Just one shot

381
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,079
Lying there, and it was just my back

382
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
What's wrong with earth signs?

383
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
What's wrong with earth signs?

384
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,840
"Quietly passionate"

385
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
How many earth signs do we have here?

386
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,640
I'm an earth sign too.

387
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
What's your zodiac sign?

388
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,080
Capricorn.

389
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,600
Capricorn.

390
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Capricorn.

391
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Yeah.

392
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,240
You're a Capricorn too.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,840
So you're a Capricorn too.

394
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,360
Capricorn.

395
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
We're all Capricorns.

396
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
We're all Capricorns.

397
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,600
He's not a Capricorn.

398
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,320
He just had his birthday.

399
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,920
Aries.

400
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,720
He's an Aries.

401
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Yeah.

402
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,640
Aries.

403
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,000
He's in the group chat.

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,880
We celebrated his birthday.

405
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,840
Yeah.

406
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,760
You just went through the motions.

407
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,520
You didn't really mean it at all.

408
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,080
Let's go.

409
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
Guys,

410
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Is there something in this water?

411
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Is there something in the water?

412
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,040
There should just be water in the water.

413
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,400
Come on.

414
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Who's cold? Are you cold?

415
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
Goodbye, friend.

416
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,480
Goodbye, friend.

417
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,760
Goodbye.

418
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,320
It's a bit hot. Hot.

419
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
Is this cold?

420
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
That's water.

421
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,240
Water.

422
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to drink hot water.

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Is there hot water?

424
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Give it to A Jin.

425
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
Get a cup of hot water for A Jin.

426
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,640
You wear this suit and style your hair like this,

427
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
it really looks good.

428
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,800
Is there anything I don't look good in?

429
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,240
Go ahead and keep pouring.

430
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,320
I'll get a cup of water for A Jin.

431
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay.

432
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
Thank you.

433
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,760
Brother Bai Yu,

434
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
Is 64-degree water okay?

435
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
Yes, thank you.

436
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,760
180.

437
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,560
105, maybe.

438
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,840
105 degrees.

439
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
That's too hot, babe.

440
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
180 degrees? That's deep-frying.

441
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
This is really cute.

442
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Yes.

443
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
Come on.

444
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,040
What is this (gesture)?

445
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
Eyelid twitch.

446
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Kiss three times.

447
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm going to spin.

448
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,440
You need to spin.

449
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,960
Right here.

450
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,040
Try it.

451
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,040
Just like spinning a basketball.

452
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Where is the bread?

453
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,200
Basement? Is there really a basement?

454
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
Where is the garage?

455
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,400
How do you get to the garage?

456
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,080
You guys are security guards,

457
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
and you don't even know where the garage is?

458
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
Then let's ask Xiao Cheng.

459
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Where is the garage?

460
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,480
Garage.

461
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
Take the elevator down to B1.

462
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
Thank you.

463
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,160
Elevator.

464
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,080
Elevator.

465
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,880
Right.

466
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
Just a little.

467
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,000
This seems like...

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,760
There are so many.

469
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,080
Okay.

470
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,200
It's fine, I can't eat it.

471
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you want to eat some?

472
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
Who reads this?

473
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,080
Didn't you write this?

474
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,520
Yeah, only you can read it.

475
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,360
Can't you read it?

476
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Why is it that when you talk,

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,880
it's always in the same tone?

478
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,560
Because I memorized it all in Thai.

479
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,200
Why are you singing?

480
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Thank you.

481
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
That last part just now.

482
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
Thai and German.

483
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,600
No, Russian.

484
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,360
Already.

485
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,200
Used up all our energy.

486
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,400
Good thing I didn't take part.

487
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
You two worked hard.

488
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,360
You three.

489
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,160
Including Zhou Keyu.

490
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,320
You all put in a lot of effort.

491
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,600
Such a kind person.

492
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,320
This bread is delicious.

493
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,960
This bread.

494
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,120
This one is also delicious.

495
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,760
What is this?

496
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,520
Mulberry?

497
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Blueberry.

498
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,600
Blueberry.

499
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
Mulberry.

500
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,800
You guys go ahead.

501
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,760
I'll stay here and eat for a bit.

502
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,440
What is this thing?

503
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Green apple.

504
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Green apple.

505
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,520
This one looks like a pear.

506
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,600
Is this a green apple?

507
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,280
I really

508
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Am I not?

509
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,920
Is this what green apples look like?

510
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Sugar apple

511
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,760
What fruit is this? Is it?

512
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
You try one.

513
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,480
Why do I feel like I've never seen this before?

514
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,000
This fruit.

515
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
What is this?

516
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,120
Is it a sugar apple, or what is it called?

517
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,760
It's not a sugar apple.

518
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,200
No, it's not.

519
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
It's not a sugar apple.

520
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,600
Sugar apple, no.

521
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,560
Is it the bumpy one?

522
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,520
You look like you're filming a commercial.

523
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,280
Wearing this outfit.

524
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
With this green apple, it looks really nice.

525
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,400
Crisp pear.

526
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Pear.

527
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,640
Pear.

528
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
It kind of looks like a pear.

529
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,120
Not bad.

530
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,040
It's not that sweet.

531
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,640
If you don't need this,

532
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
I'll throw out the trash.

533
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,960
Who left this eaten candy

534
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,760
right here?

535
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,840
I'll do it.

536
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,160
You brought it yourself, right?

537
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,440
Do you want it?

538
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,280
I want to have some of yours.

539
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,040
No, you can't have any.

540
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,000
No.

541
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,560
Why are you still holding a grudge?

542
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,320
No, neither of you can have any.

543
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Why are you still—

544
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
Weren't you the one who tricked him before?

545
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
Is this how you treat your brother?

546
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,240
Everyone, grab an umbrella. There are some next to you.

547
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,520
Get an umbrella.

548
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,160
(I misheard) I thought you said "clap the board."

549
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,720
Clap the board, clap the board.

550
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,520
Not "open the umbrella."

551
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,040
Clap the board.

552
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,200
Open an umbrella, it's raining outside.

553
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,280
How many umbrellas?

554
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,720
How many umbrellas?

555
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,080
Sorry.

556
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,320
Because I already clapped the board just now.

557
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
Then let me fight you.

558
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,760
I want to fight you.

559
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
Why are we fighting each other?

560
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,840
We're monsters, do we need a reason?

561
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,680
I don't believe you can get the male lead.

562
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,320
Eat him.

563
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
He came by motorcycle today.

564
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,600
He came by motorcycle.

565
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
So beautiful.

566
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,120
The first time you saw her, really—

567
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,920
No, it's just that every time, she amazes me.
