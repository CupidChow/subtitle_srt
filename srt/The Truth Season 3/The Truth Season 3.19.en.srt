1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,280
I am Tui Houlang.

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,960
I am Tui Houlang.

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,120
The manager of the mansion.

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Tui Houlang died in here.

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,800
He drowned.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,120
So anyone could be involved.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,800
I think my father’s death

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,920
was caused by them.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,440
To protect myself and my daughter,

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,200
I want to kill him.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
I wanted to kill his father.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,200
Your sister’s misfortune is related to Tui Houlang.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,960
Isn’t that right?

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,640
Yes.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,360
Four people worked together.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Health syrup mixed with wine.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,120
They poisoned it.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,800
Maybe he never had a son.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,200
The killer knew he was Tui Qianlang.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Maybe he didn’t actually drown.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
He was drugged instead.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Let’s go back and check the body

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
for any black marks.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
To determine if he was poisoned or drowned.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,760
Let’s go back and check the body

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,560
for any black marks.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,000
Then we can confirm

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
if he was killed by this “Du Lai Du Wang” poison

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,240
and poisoned,

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,960
or if he drowned.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,960
That’s right.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay.

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,880
Alright?

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,760
Alright, let’s go back and check.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,560
Let’s go.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,840
Let’s go confirm that now.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,040
Ba

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,880
Here

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,000
Someone just came in

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Who is that

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,640
Wearing glow-in-the-dark clothes

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Who is it

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,800
He ran away

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,520
Come back

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,440
He just now...

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,000
He has black markings on his body, so basically...

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
Aren't those markings not black

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,360
They're green and glowing

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,280
They're fluorescent, right

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,360
Let's check the body first

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,240
Let's look at the body first

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,760
Let's go

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,040
Go

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Why are these here

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
There's definitely something wrong

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,600
He's still lying here in this position

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
Why did his hair turn white

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,080
His hair really turned white

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,160
So he's the one who aged, right

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Got it

61
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,280
Look at his neck

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,400
So I'm thinking

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,320
Why did he die from poisoning

64
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,760
Why was he soaked in water

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,480
To make us think he drowned

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
So he's that person

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
Yes, look at his skin

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,080
It's aged

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
So he is

70
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,160
the one pushing the old out for the new

71
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
Your motives for murder

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,760
are all valid.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
Ning Jiedai's motive for murder is

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
to wait until all three exhibitions are over,

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
then he can kill them.

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,320
So you knew he was going to kill us.

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,880
That's right.

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,160
You thought I was your daughter.

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,400
You wanted to protect me.

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,240
So, to protect yourself and your daughter,

81
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I had to kill him.

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
I saw this information in the newspaper.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
It was about the captain's son pushing the next generation.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
The news that the salvage efforts had failed after three months.

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
Then I realized

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
that Baba Liu really had left.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,120
Because the whole ship had already sunk.

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
The previous generation already knew back then

89
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,400
that this ship was going to sink.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,600
But he still let everyone go down with the ship.

91
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,760
He didn't tell anyone.

92
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,640
My father might have boarded

93
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,600
that "Dash" or whatever it was called.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,280
And in the end, because of this accident,

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,920
he died.

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,880
Then I hired a private detective to investigate.

97
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,360
He found out that the captain knew before setting sail

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,680
that the ship was doomed.

99
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
I think my father's death

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,840
was caused by them.

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
My sister died at sea.

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,320
This whole thing is very suspicious.

103
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,720
Why is that?

104
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,519
Because she would never go to the seaside again.

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,519
I understand, she was afraid of water.

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,600
On the day she died,

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,320
she was supposed to come here for work.

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
To avenge my sister,

109
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
but why

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,080
did he have to live as his son?

111
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,480
It was to escape the crime from back then.

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,960
Confirmed: January 1st, 22XX.

113
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,600
No survivors in the "Dash" shipwreck incident.

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,720
"Dash" captain's logbook.

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
After calculations,

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,280
the ship will completely sink thirty minutes after departure.

117
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
It takes twenty minutes to deploy the lifeboats.

118
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,880
We must act quickly.

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,360
What does that mean?

120
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
He knew the ship was going to sink.

121
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Now we can

122
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
go check out that secret room.

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,200
Every time after I finish performing,

124
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,320
when I come to the study to get his signature and collect my pay,

125
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,040
he always brings a strange bottle

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,400
and goes into a room inside his study.

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
Okay.

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,760
Then let's go.

129
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
The boss's study.

130
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Isn't this the secret room?

131
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,520
It won't open.

132
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
I think it's this spot.

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,600
Up there?

134
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,760
That one should definitely open.

135
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Wait a second.

136
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,880
Hold on.

137
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
This one can open, this one.

138
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
This can be opened.

139
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,840
Come on, push and take a look.

140
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,560
Alright.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Push and check.

142
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Is this easy to climb?

143
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Cool push and check, go!

144
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
Cool push and check, go!

145
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Number one explorer in the world.

146
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
Number one explorer in the world.

147
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,320
Is it this door?

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Guys, come over here.

149
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Go ahead.

151
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,200
Ladies first.

152
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,560
Go on.

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
We have to climb again.

154
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
And go down, too.

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Yeah.

156
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,960
Hurry up, those in the back.

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,520
Not very friendly for us tall people.

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
Lift your gun, your weapon.

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Your weapon.

160
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Wait a second.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,800
Still have to climb.

162
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,440
Are you okay?

163
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Why does it feel like it’s taking you longer than us?

164
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Not very friendly for us tall people.

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,760
Captain Dash, your clothes.

166
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,160
Old Man’s Treasure.

167
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,720
Give me one.

168
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,160
A new healthy life.

169
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Today, let’s do this together.

170
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
This is a real radio station.

171
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,720
That means he really is an old man.

172
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,600
He’s using a radio.

173
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,080
And drinking tea, playing chess.

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
Come on, let’s search again, everyone.

175
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,400
There’s a document here.

176
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,880
Tui City Bank Transaction Alert

177
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,360

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,400
It is forbidden to inquire about passenger information on the ship

193
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
2. All work details must remain confidential

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,920
In case of breach of contract

195
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Party B must pay Party A

196
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
a compensation of 200,000 yuan

197
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,320
The ship will completely sink thirty minutes after departure.

198
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,920
It takes twenty minutes to deploy the lifeboats.

199
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
But this person's real intention

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
wasn't actually to kill these people.

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,800
He was just hired.

202
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,400
That's right.

203
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,680
It takes thirty minutes for the ship to sink.

204
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
And the lifeboats arrive at the scene

205
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
in just twenty minutes.

206
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,120
That was for his own boat.

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,760
He didn't intend to save anyone else on the ship.

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
He only wanted to save himself.

209
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Then there's no need to solve the case.

210
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,840
This person deserves to die.

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,120
What?

212
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
Are you already siding with the killer?

213
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,000
Really?

214
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
Who are you protecting?

215
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm not X.

216
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,000
Who are you suspecting? Tell me.

217
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,880
So that means he wants to

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,400
sacrifice so many people every time.

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Maybe he sank it on purpose.

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,480
Then, after many years, he wants to

221
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,400
go back and find it again.

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,040
Yes, go back and find it.

223
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,520
And keep it for himself.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
No, he knows he's alive.

225
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,280
On January 2nd, 20XX,

226
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,120
he transferred him some money.

227
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
He knows he didn't die.

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
So maybe this plan

229
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
is actually the Tuixian Group's plan.

230
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes, that's right.

231
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,480
Let's search again.

232
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,200
I've already checked.

233
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
There's nothing.

234
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,840
Medical examination report

235
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
So, back in 2019,

236
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,920
he was fifty-four years old.

237
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
Now it's the younger generation's turn.

238
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,520
Male, age thirty.

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
His medical examination conclusion is

240
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,440
hearing loss in both ears, blurred vision,

241
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis.

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
It's the same person.

243
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,640
Exactly the same.

244
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,120
There's more here.

245
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,600
It is recommended to temporarily use "Laonianbao".

246
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,560
to slow the progression of related symptoms.

247
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
and to seek medical attention as soon as possible.

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Ba Jiaoshan

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
After he became younger,

250
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,920
they suggested he take "Laonianbao".

251
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Right.

252
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,480
So, he became younger

253
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,400
not because of "Laonianbao".

254
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,520
Not because of "Laonianbao".

255
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,440
Decipher the password.

256
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,120
Double password, six digits.

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,640
I got it.

258
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,680
Pizza.

259
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
P I Z Z A, this is P.

260
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
Cake, C A K E.

261
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,480
A.

262
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
Book, B O O K.

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:16,880
O.

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,120
That's six.

265
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,400
This should be phone, cat.

266
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
This is one.

267
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,200
It's not English.

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,520
This one.

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't know.

270
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know.

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,360
I didn't know it would be so loud.

272
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Can you face your English teacher?

273
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,880
I don't have an English teacher.

274
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,080
I'm my own English teacher.

275
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
What a coincidence.

276
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,280
Pantene Bubble Hair Mask.

277
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
My hair is usually exposed to wind and sun.

278
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
It's because I use Pantene Bubble Hair Mask.

279
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,120
I use this hair mask.

280
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
It contains tiny essence beads.

281
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,160
Keep using it.

282
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
That's how you nourish your hair.

283
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,400
It becomes bouncy and shiny.

284
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
And it has a woody rose scent.

285
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,200
Let me let you try it.

286
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
How are you going to let me try it?

287
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
I made a portable fragrance.

288
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,760
Made with the bubble hair mask.

289
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,120
Try it.

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,840
How is it?

291
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
It smells pretty good.

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,800
Remember to use it.

293
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,920
It smells so nice.

294
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,760
Come on.

295
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
So is the password

296
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
Pantene Bubble Hair Mask?

297
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,080
It must be.

298
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,880
We just took some rations with us.

299
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
And a bottle with a five-pointed star.

300
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,920
We went to the storage room at the bottom of the ship.

301
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,200
That thing of mine—

302
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
This is the one we got from that cave back then.

303
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
We filled it with water.

304
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,680
And the ship where we had those rations.

305
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
How did it end up with him?

306
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,640
There's something written on it.

307
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,920
Fountain of Youth.

308
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,760
Fountain of Youth.

309
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,200
So, on that island we were on,

310
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,680
there really was a Fountain of Youth.

311
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,280
He stopped aging.

312
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,000
It wasn't because he took supplements.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,160
That he stayed young at that age.

314
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,760
It was because of the Fountain of Youth.

315
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,880
But his internal organs kept deteriorating.

316
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,160
It could only keep his appearance from aging.

317
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,200
Maintain.

318
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,880
I think what the Fountain of Youth does is

319
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,720
it keeps him forever

320
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,200
in the physical state of a fifty-four-year-old.

321
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,640
So when he gets checked again,

322
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
even though that's the case,

323
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
I don't think he'll necessarily die.

324
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,480
Can this phone make calls?

325
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,000
Try calling.

326
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,280
I think we should

327
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,440
use this to make a call first.

328
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,520
Ask Dr. Tui.

329
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay.

330
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,640
Let's go.

331
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,160
Let's go.

332
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,400
There's a phone at the reception. Let's go.

333
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,960
Alright.

334
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,560
Yes, there's a landline.

335
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,240
Where is the phone?

336
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,440
Here.

337
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,280
Can this be used?

338
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,560
Is this usable?

339
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes, definitely.

340
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
This really works.

341
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Hello, is this Dr. Tui?

342
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,880
What's going on? This is Dr. Tui.

343
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
I want to ask something.

344
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,880
At your Tui City First Hospital,

345
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
do you have physical examination services?

346
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
We have two people here.

347
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,440
It's very strange.

348
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,240
One is named Tui Qianlang

349
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,760
and the other is Tui Houlang.

350
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,840
I only accept consultations from Mr. Tui Houlang.

351
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I am his personal doctor.

352
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Sorry.

353
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,280
I'll have Tui Houlang talk to you in a moment.

354
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,880
I'll let Tui Houlang talk to you.

355
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,120
He's here, he's here.

356
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,680
Hello, I'm Tui Houlang.

357
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,200
Why did he hang up?

358
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,079
He thinks you're not certain.

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Hello, Dr. Tui.

360
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,079
I remember Mr. Tui Houlang.

361
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,720
He can make a super magnetic

362
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
deep, bubbly voice.

363
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,480
That's right.

364
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,359
That's me.

365
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,360
Tui Houlang.

366
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,480
Sir.

367
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
is "near death."

368
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
That's right.

369
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,960
By the way,

370
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,840
I remember

371
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,760
Mr. Tui Houlang

372
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,200
also has a parrot that's great at imitating.

373
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,040
I remember it can even imitate an old lady scolding people.

374
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm Liang Zhichao's grandma.

375
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
If you make any more requests, I'll scold you.

376
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,400
Scold me, scold me like crazy!

377
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,480
Hurry up, little parrot!

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
He calls me little parrot.

379
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,080
You

380
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,760
big pervert!

381
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
What a great little parrot!

382
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
By the way, Mr. Tuihoulang,

383
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
why did you call today, anyway?

384
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,040
Of course.

385
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,400
I wanted to ask about my physical condition.

386
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,880
You said that I

387
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,680
have brain tissue and organ atrophy.

388
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,360
The cause is unknown.

389
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,000
Further tests are needed for a definitive diagnosis.

390
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,200
So have you confirmed the diagnosis now?

391
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,600
About my physical condition—

392
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,120
the cause still can't be found.

393
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,520
Has anyone recently bought the drug "Du Lai Du Wang" from you?

394
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,120
Has anyone purchased it from you recently?

395
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,080
That's serious.

396
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,480
The poison "Du Lai Du Wang"

397
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,360
is extremely dangerous.

398
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,160
You all must be very careful.

399
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,400
"Du Lai Du Wang" is colorless and tasteless,

400
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
so it's very hard to detect.

401
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,360
When it reacts with sodium hydroxide,

402
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,640
it turns purplish red,

403
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
orange-red,

404
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
or wine red.

405
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,600
That—

406
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
purplish red.

407
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
Yes, purplish red.

408
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,240
Purplish red.

409
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,800
Most common alkaline disinfectant sprays

410
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,160
contain sodium hydroxide.

411
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,120
Alright.

412
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,800
Okay, let's talk later. I'm busy now.

413
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,520
Alright, let's go find where the sodium hydroxide is first.

414
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,040
That one.

415
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,200
That.

416
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,560
Which one?

417
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,680
Right next to the flowers.

418
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
The ones used to disinfect the flowers.

419
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,560
I want to know what this is.

420
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,160
For disinfecting skin and clothes.

421
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,080
Do we need to pull out these flowers?

422
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Is there something inside?

423
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,520
Just pull it out by force.

424
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,160
This one can't be pulled out.

425
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
Then find one that can be pulled out.

426
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,280
None of them can be pulled out.

427
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,840
I tried them all.

428
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah.

429
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
See, now you're using it.

430
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,440
So after all this time,

431
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,920
it was just this.

432
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,320
We spent all that time pulling flowers.

433
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,840
This isn't a highlight, it's a blunder.

434
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,200
A low point.

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,360
Let's go check the lounge.

436
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's go.

437
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,240
Spray it, just these.

438
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,200
There's some in here.

439
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,200
There's some on the wine glass.

440
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,120
There's some in the wine glass.

441
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
There's some in the wine glass.

442
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,280
So they poisoned his glass.

443
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
How did he make sure

444
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,360
the poison went into his glass?

445
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,000
Unless he's one of the

446
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,480
staff.

447
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
Receptionist.

448
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,480
Have you tried this health concentrate?

449
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,280
Yes.

450
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
Is it possible that...

451
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,960
There are two murderers.

452
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,080
Two people both did this.

453
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,520
Is it possible?

454
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,080
What do you mean?

455
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,400
One person put the poison

456
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
into the syrup.

457
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,640
Another person poisoned his wine glass.

458
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,360
Is that possible?

459
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,000
If that's the case,

460
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,360
could it be three people?

461
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,080
Why?

462
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,680
Because in the end,

463
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,760
he died in the water.

464
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,120
Isn't that unnecessary?

465
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,760
"Live long"

466
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,840
"Live long"

467
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,800
First pour into the cup

468
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,760
the health concentrate.

469
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,160
Then add 150 milliliters of medicine.

470
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,800
No need to stir, sip

471
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,440
and drink slowly.

472
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Take it at dinner time.

473
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,640
It needs to be mixed with the health syrup.

474
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
So it really is

475
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,480
poured into the wine glass.

476
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,840
Stirred and drunk, right?

477
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,760
So actually, now we have the motive

478
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,920
and the method as well.

479
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,680
We're just missing the timing.

480
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,880
No.

481
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,680
I want to ask something.

482
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,200
Can we confirm

483
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
that the person who poisoned him and the person who tried to drown him

484
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,520
are two different people?

485
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,560
We can't confirm that.

486
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,800
Right, or to make sure—

487
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,600
Was poisoning part of his plan?

488
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,200
No.

489
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,160
This drug was the cause of death.

490
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Then why did they still

491
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,920
put him in that tank?

492
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,600
He wanted revenge.

493
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,120
He wanted him to experience

494
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
what it's like to die in water.

495
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,080
I think if he

496
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,000
drowned him in the tank,

497
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,080
he would definitely die, right?

498
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,400
Yes.

499
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,040
So why bother poisoning him too?

500
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
For example, if I were the killer,

501
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,040
and I wanted this person dead,

502
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,440
and I wanted him to drown,

503
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
then I wouldn't need to

504
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,240
use poison at all.

505
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,440
That step

506
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,400
I would just need to knock him out,

507
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,920
put him in after six hours,

508
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
and as usual today,

509
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
during the water-filling part,

510
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,640
he would die there.

511
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,120
There's no need for me to

512
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,480
poison him a day in advance.

513
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
Because the way I want him to die

514
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
is by drowning.

515
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,080
So drowning and poisoning

516
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
are two different things.

517
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
So I think

518
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
there are two killers.

519
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
One caused the death directly,

520
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,800
the other just didn't kill him.

521
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Is it possible

522
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Yes.

523
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,040
Next.

524
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,400
Let's go to the next place.

525
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,480
It's time to burn it, right?

526
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes, the third bell is to light the boat.

527
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,480
Three bell chimes will ignite the boat.

528
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,160
There are words on the ground.

529
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
There are words on the ground.

530
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,600
The participants are on the "Classic Eternal Boat".

531
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,480
It's the three poses from that photo.

532
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Three classic poses.

533
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes.

534
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
Shall we tear it off?

535
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,360
Guys,

536
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,880
okay.

537
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
Take it down.

538
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,040
Come on.

539
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,120
Strike the pose.

540
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,160
Come on.

541
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Ba.

542
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,400
The first one, come.

543
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
Here, I'm the one in front.

544
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,720
On my right side is a

545
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,440
man in a brown robe.

546
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,920
Is that me?

547
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,760
Yes.

548
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm like this.

549
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
No, you're not holding her hand.

550
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,040
You're holding hands with the person behind you.

551
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,640
You hold my hand.

552
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,560
You hold my hand.

553
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,480
Yes.

554
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,080
Then the person behind holds his hand.

555
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
You hold his hand.

556
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll hold his hand.

557
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,600
I'll hold his hand.

558
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,920
Yes.

559
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
You're not holding my hand.

560
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,160
Then whose hand should I hold?

561
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,240
I'll hold yours.

562
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,280
You're supposed to hold the hand of the person behind you.

563
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,640
Then who do I hold? I...

564
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
That hand of yours goes here.

565
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Don't move that hand over there.

566
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
This hand of mine is here.

567
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,760
Yes, you two hold hands.

568
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,680
You two hold hands.

569
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,080
Which hand should I hold?

570
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,400
Yes, just like that.

571
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,560
Use your outer hand to hold.

572
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,280
Grab.

573
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,920
Hold the hand.

574
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Okay, one, two, three, cheese!

575
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,160
Next.

576
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
Make a heart shape in the back, make a heart shape in the front.

577
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,040
Come on.

578
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,640
One, two, three, cheese!

579
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,640
Next.

580
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,280
Person in brown, person in blue, go up.

581
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm over there.

582
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,080
Okay, three, two, one.

583
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,080
It's on fire.

584
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Hold hands and stand around the pool.

585
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,240
Shout together: Hai hai hai hai hai!

586
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Dao Island, Dao Island, Island, Dao Island!

587
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,280
You can ignite the flame of victory.

588
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Light up the path to the mysterious island.

589
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,440
Let's go, go!

590
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,280
Follow the guiding lights.

591
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,760
Over there.

592
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,680
Go.

593
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,560
Wait a moment.

594
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,000
We need that.

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Animal sounds and movements.

596
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,680
Line up.

597
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
We need to start from inside.

598
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,760
Come on, first one.

599
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm the last one.

600
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,400
Ready, three, two, one, go!

601
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,400
Hand in hand, come.

602
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,320
Hand in hand, circle around.

603
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,960
Come.

604
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey hai hey hai hai hey hai.

605
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,920
Dao Island Dao Island Island Dao Island.

606
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,640
They really burned the boat.

607
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,200
This is so impressive.

608
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,120
Hiromi

609
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,000
The light in the back just turned on.

610
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
That's the pirate's mark.

611
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,120
All the candles here are lit.

612
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,080
What should we do?

613
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,640
The candles are lit.

614
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,280
Is it guiding us somewhere?

615
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Follow the candles.

616
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,320
Is it over there?

617
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,480
Go toward that candle.

618
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,040
Let's go.

619
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,200
Come on, let's go.

620
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,800
Right?

621
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,200
Okay, we're getting on the boat.

622
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,520
We're boarding the boat in the middle of the night.

623
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,440
There's a bag over there.

624
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,080
There's a bag.

625
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,840
We can't get on, be careful with that.

626
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,360
No need to get on.

627
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,480
Just pull it over.

628
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,920
Pull the rope.

629
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
The boat drifted away.

630
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,120
This one.

631
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
Take this, take this one.

632
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,000
Take this.

633
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,480
Yes.

634
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,960
That's right.

635
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,200
There, that's it.

636
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,280
You're so smart.

637
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,160
Be careful.

638
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,080
All set.

639
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,480
All right, let's go.

640
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,640
The treasure is inside here, guys.

641
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,200
I don't believe it.

642
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,040
Let's go, head up to the second floor.

643
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,920
Is anyone there?

644
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,760
Is anyone there?

645
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Is anyone here?

646
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,080
Someone is shouting.

647
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,640
Is anyone there?

648
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,560
There’s someone—someone is shouting.

649
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,400
Is anyone here?

650
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,880
Yes.

651
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,040
Push the newcomer forward.

652
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
Come down quickly.

653
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,360
Our boss is here.

654
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,160
There really is a boss.

655
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,600
Why are you so happy to see the boss?

656
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Boss.

657
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,160
The boss is really handsome.

658
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
He looks so blessed.

659
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,440
He looks so blessed.

660
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
Look at the flesh on his face.

661
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
He came carrying a box.

662
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
Boss, what's going on, boss?

663
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm Ren Weishan.

664
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,680
Tui Houlang sent me here.

665
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
What blood types are you all?

666
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,760
What blood types are we?

667
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
I'm O.

668
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
Why did you just tell him?

669
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,040
What does he do?

670
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,880
He's the boss.

671
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,480
So what if he's the boss?

672
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,440
Watch your mouth.

673
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
I told Tui Houlang

674
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,640
that I would check in today.

675
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,120
You should've said so earlier.

676
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
I know about this.

677
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,120
Tui Houlang told me about it yesterday.

678
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,080
I was told to give you this key.

679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,520
Thank you.

680
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,560
Hand out business cards to them.

681
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
They all seem like good people to me.

682
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,560
Here.

683
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,440
Ren Weishan, Chairman of Tui Xian Group.

684
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,600
Wait a moment, boss.

685
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
There's a loose thread here, let me get it for you.

686
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,640
Trying to steal my job, huh?

687
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,680
You don't notice the details.

688
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,840
Which room are we staying in?

689
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,320
This way, please. Room 201.

690
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,120
Take your time, boss.

691
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,920
Do you want me to help you, boss?

692
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,040
What are you doing?

693
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm helping the boss.

694
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,920
This girl is really outgoing.

695
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,560
Boss, I feel really close to you.

696
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Go on, Tui Tan.

697
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
Here, take a look.

698
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,640
You said

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,280
this note talks about the legend

700
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,240
that the coastal area of Tui City was once

701
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,520
rampaged by pirates

702
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,040
who plundered ships

703
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,680
but the most mysterious and terrifying among them

704
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,520
was Tui Sanniang, known as the Sea Rakshasa

705
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,200
Tui Sanniang was originally an orphan from a fishing family

706
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,120
who later came across a secret technique

707
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
using human sacrifice

708
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,560
to harness the power of sea monsters

709
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,120
she could summon storms and command sea creatures

710
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,600
and became the first female pirate in history

711
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,280
The legend of Tui Sanniang

712
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,640
And then there’s some kind of log after that

713
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,920
Whose diary is this?

714
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
It must be that old Tui guy’s

715
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Tui Laolang

716
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,440
The boss told me to sink everyone on the ship

717
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,400
I just happened to be able to use them

718
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
to complete the sacrifice

719
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,720
I installed a low-frequency player on the ship

720
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Sure enough, I heard people on board complaining

721
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,800
about strange, noisy sounds

722
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,120
When we were about to reach international waters

723
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
I found a few of the complainers

724
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
and dressed them in pirate costumes like our ancestors

725
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,440
ordered them to pour water into the glass box one by one

726
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,840
then had them return to their cabins to wait

727
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
then made them imitate the sounds of sea creatures

728
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,760
finally, I burned a paper boat on the deck

729
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,040
and made a hole in the bottom of the ship

730
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,880
a large hole fifty centimeters in diameter

731
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,240
then put the lifeboat into the sea

732
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
After calculating

733
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,080
arrived

734
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,199
The sacrifice really is real.

735
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,360
What the ancestors wrote on the pirate flag

736
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,520
was true after all.

737
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,199
Let youth and wealth embrace me.

738
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,840
We have to get ready to set sail again.

739
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,639
This time, we first need to

740
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,040
complete three initiation rituals at the pirate manor.

741
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,120
Then take them out to sea.

742
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,679
And perform the sacrifice at sea.

743
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,120
So we haven't set sail yet, right?

744
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,040
No, not yet.

745
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,080
Right, of course we haven't.

746
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,960
What he just wrote

747
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,480
was meant to be done on the ship.

748
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,800
He just wants

749
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,600
us to complete that whole sequence.

750
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
He wants us to board that ship

751
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,880
and then perform the sacrifice.

752
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,080
That's possible.

753
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
So we have to dress

754
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,040
exactly like their ancestors.

755
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,679
That's right.

756
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,520
That's why he chose us.

757
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,120
Khoomei.

758
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
A few people left messages

759
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,639
When visiting the exhibition

760
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,440
the whole lobby feels like

761
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,199
crickets are having a party

762
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,760
Every time I come to perform, I always hear strange noises

763
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,520
I suggest making some improvements

764
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,680
Don't let it affect everyone's business

765
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
Ba Jiaoshan

766
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
Art can be abstract

767
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,440
but this is just too noisy

768
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,120
Please change it as soon as possible

769
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,000
Said by Baizhihua

770
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,840
Heard some uncomfortable sounds in the mansion

771
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,160
It kind of affects the mood for appreciating the treasures

772
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,760
Recently, the noise in the mansion has been severe

773
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,880
Even as a middle-aged person, when I hear it

774
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,320
I really feel it

775
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
How come there’s noise even when viewing the exhibition?

776
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,680
When my rhythm meets this noise

777
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,480
I really want to shout

778
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,680
Go away

779
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
We're all talking about the same thing

780
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,240
Ba Jiaoshan, 23 years old

781
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,200
No parents

782
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,480
Jin Shangbao

783
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,520
No living relatives

784
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
No close relationships

785
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,320
Ning Jiedai

786
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,400
Baizhihua

787
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,000
Ke Wuwang

788
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,720
No close relationships

789
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
Why is it the six of us?

790
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,840
Because we have no family

791
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,960
Even if we go missing

792
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,480
no one would worry about us

793
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,360
No one would care if we died

794
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,200
That's why he chose us

795
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
Pour water into the glass box

796
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,960
Then each of us returns to our own small room to wait

797
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
Then have them imitate the sounds of sea creatures

798
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,920
Finally, burn a paper boat on the deck

799
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
Then take them out to sea

800
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,840
And perform the sacrifice at sea

801
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
So if this Fountain of Youth

802
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,720
appeared after his sacrifice

803
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,000
and floated up from the seabed

804
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,520
why does she have this bottle?

805
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
He mistakenly thought

806
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,880
it was actually her bottle

807
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
that accidentally floated out

808
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,480
He thought

809
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,960
this bottle must have been a gift from the heavens

810
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,440
Little did he know

811
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,560
it was actually brought from the island by her

812
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:30,920
Right

813
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,840
So you think the ship sank

814
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,360
and the bottle floated up

815
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,760
Okay, there's also a watch

816
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,480
There's a memo on it

817
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,760
January 1, 2021

818
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,720
My sister got this tattoo at that time.

819
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,720
To remind herself

820
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
never to forget her kindness.

821
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,400
This is my sister's bag.

822
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,520
They're two different things.

823
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
Because it might really be that person

824
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,280
who pushed Qianlang and killed your sister.

825
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
That's why he kept this thing.

826
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,320
He put it together with her diary.

827
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,640
A recording.

828
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,120
Boss, did you drink the Fountain of Youth?

829
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,800
Is that why you became like this?

830
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,400
Then you know

831
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,440
How do you know about the Fountain of Youth?

832
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,280
Wait, that's not right.

833
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,760
How do you know I drank the Fountain of Youth?

834
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,280
I saw your medical report and knew you drank it.

835
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,120
Besides you, who else knows about this?

836
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,920
No one else.

837
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
But how did you get the Fountain of Youth?

838
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,080
You...

839
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,560
You are...

840
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,720
You are what?

841
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,000
You must be Qianlang.

842
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
She must have recognized him.

843
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,600
So he killed her.

844
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
That's why my sister told me

845
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
she had a shocking secret.

846
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,000
I think I've discovered a huge secret.

847
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,960
I...

848
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,000
And then...

849
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,560
Yes.

850
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,160
She called her sister.

851
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,000
She wanted to ask about the secret, right?

852
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,440
Yes.

853
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,880
But...

854
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,600
Her sister never answered her calls again.

855
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,680
This is the secret my sister discovered.

856
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,720
Just now, we

857
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,600
When we were deducing the murderer earlier,

858
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,640
we actually deduced

859
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
that there could be two murderers.

860
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,280
Right.

861
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,120
Two different methods were used.

862
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,880
One method was poisoning.

863
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,800
He was poisoned to death.

864
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,760
The other method was

865
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,560
using that water tank

866
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,360
to drown the victim.

867
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
But in fact, the cause of death

868
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,200
was only one.

869
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,920
What we need to determine now is

870
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
which one caused the

871
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,160
death of the victim.

872
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,240
We can also deduce

873
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,040
who the real murderer is.

874
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,480
That's right.

875
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,880
So two people committed the crime.

876
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,320
Exactly.

877
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
So how do we distinguish between these two methods

878
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,880
and figure out which one was fatal?

879
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
Arrange the timeline.

880
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,120
Arrange the timeline.

881
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
Yes, by using the timeline

882
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,920
to eliminate some of the

883
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,640
impossible methods.

884
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
Yesterday, we were all

885
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,080
invited to this living room at six o'clock sharp.

886
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Then, we each left at different times.

887
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,640
We need to determine

888
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
at what time he

889
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,840
could have taken this thing.

890
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
Let's start with you.

891
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
I left at 6:20.

892
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,600
Ning, you left at 6:20.

893
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,080
Is that right?

894
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,320
Yes.

895
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,480
I left at 6:25.

896
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
Left at 18:25.

897
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,440
I was at 6:35.

898
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
I should be the third one.

899
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,600
Jin was at 18:35.

900
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,720
Ba was at 18:45.

901
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,480
We left at 7:00.

902
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,760
So it ended at 7:00.

903
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,360
Yes.

904
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
The time he took the medicine

905
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,640
could be right after you left.

906
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,040
But after 7:00, he left first.

907
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,560
So it's possible that after you two left,

908
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,440
he came back to take it.

909
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,560
He definitely took it during dinner.

910
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,000
The health syrup combined with "Live Long"

911
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,480
must be taken at dinner time.

912
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,960
So, according to this logic,

913
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
he must have taken it between 6:00 and 7:00.

914
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,440
Makes sense.

915
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,440
Yes.

916
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,960
If the victim was poisoned,

917
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,280
it must have been the day before.

918
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,240
Count back twelve hours from when he took the medicine.

919
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,920
Once taken,

920
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
he would die exactly twelve hours later.

921
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,960
The latest time of death must be 7:00.

922
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes.

923
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,320
Yes.

924
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,880
But the earliest time can't be determined.

925
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
Because you don't know when the poison was added.

926
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,680
And you don't know when he took action.

927
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,400
Earliest time of death

928
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
I think it's six o'clock

929
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,600
You couldn't have died before six

930
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,480
No way you died earlier

931
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,880
We still saw him at six

932
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,840
It's exactly six o'clock now

933
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,200
I think drowning is definitely more likely

934
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,240
than being poisoned

935
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,800
Can we confirm

936
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
if someone can step forward like this

937
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,480
Because if I were the killer

938
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,320
and I poisoned him today

939
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,080
and among those who wanted to drown him

940
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,880
I went in and saw

941
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,000
he was already poisoned

942
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,680
why would I still put him in the water tank

943
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,520
to drown him again?

944
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,160
Because the poison hadn't taken effect yet

945
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
So he must have drowned

946
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,920
That's what he said

947
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,080
I understand you

948
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,880
Yes, that's right, well said

949
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,400
Whoever poisoned him can come forward now

950
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,440
Then we can rule them out

951
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
Just step forward now and that's it

952
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,360
Stepping forward can help us eliminate one possibility

953
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,120
Come out

954
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,440
Do you want to admit it?

955
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,360
No

956
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,120
Do you remember when you two used a pencil

957
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,920
to reveal something on that blank sheet of paper?

958
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,000
The hidden words.

959
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,760
There's an exclamation mark here.

960
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,360
Right here.

961
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,680
So there's actually a sentence.

962
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,960
Yes.

963
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,640
Are there words?

964
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,360
Yes, there are.

965
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,000
And a low growl was heard.

966
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
I mentioned something very important earlier today.

967
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,280
It proves who the killer that drowned the victim is.

968
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,760
Who exactly is it?

969
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,200
It's that low sound.

970
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,000
That moment of growling.

971
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,760
Bai said he heard a low sound.

972
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,800
I heard it.

973
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,760
He was the first to go in.

974
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,400
The two of us went in last.

975
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,160
We didn't hear any low sound.

976
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,080
This must be a key clue.

977
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,200
It can't just be to scare us.

978
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,760
Right.

979
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,080
So the killer didn't make a sound.

980
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
He didn't make a sound.

981
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,680
Right.

982
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,520
The killer doesn't know about him.

983
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,720
Then I heard the shout.

984
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
So if that's the case,

985
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,120
he's ruled out.

986
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,040
Okay.

987
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,240
Among the three of you,

988
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,720
there is definitely one person who knows

989
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,920
whether they heard the whisper or not.

990
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,480
But they haven't said it.

991
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I really don't remember.

992
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,240
I remember now.

993
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,320
The one I saw didn't have a whisper.

994
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,720
Because I wasn't especially scared today.

995
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,040
You know?

996
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,080
Thinking back,

997
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,360
because I wasn't especially scared today,

998
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,440
I just saw him move and it startled me.

999
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,560
If he suddenly shouted,

1000
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,640
if he suddenly made a sound,

1001
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,680
I would have been scared to death.

1002
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,240
But I wasn't especially scared today.

1003
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,400
Wait, which number were you?

1004
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,080
He's the one right before us.

1005
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,880
The one before us.

1006
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,200
The culprit is between those two.

1007
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,200
That's really "bad."

1008
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,000
You're so "bad."

1009
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,960
But I don't remember.

1010
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,560
It's okay.

1011
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,280
Then don't say anything yet.

1012
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,440
I want to know if you actually heard it.

1013
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,440
Alright.

1014
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,040
I have to be honest about something.

1015
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,000
I wanted to kill him.

1016
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,400
I really did want to kill him.

1017
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,320
The way I wanted to kill him

1018
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,640
was to push him into that tank

1019
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,920
and drown him with water.

1020
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,440
You were the one who moved him into the water.

1021
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:02,840
Yes.

1022
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
You were the one who did it.

1023
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,280
This was you, right?

1024
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,880
Yes, it was me.

1025
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,320
Wait a moment.

1026
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,880
That scared me to death.

1027
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,920
It's okay.

1028
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
But because I was too scared,

1029
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,240
I didn't fill the water all the way myself.

1030
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,720
I understand.

1031
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,000
Then, at 7:15,

1032
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,200
when you were all locked in,

1033
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,000
I checked to see if he was dead.

1034
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,400
When I came out,

1035
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,760
I saw that the water hadn't reached his nose.

1036
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,960
I thought he couldn't drown like that.

1037
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
So I went to get more water.

1038
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,720
To drown him.

1039
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,560
So in my mind,

1040
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,680
he was killed after 7:15.

1041
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,520
Killed by me.

1042
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,400
So it wasn't you who killed him.

1043
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,160
I understand.

1044
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,480
He was already dead before 7 o'clock.

1045
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,280
You mean,

1046
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,600
when you opened the lid after 7 o'clock,

1047
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,920
the water hadn't even

1048
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,640
reached him.

1049
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,120
Yes.

1050
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,040
Okay, then we can confirm one thing.

1051
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,320
Whoever poisoned him is the murderer.

1052
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,320
The murderer who just poisoned someone

1053
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,040
is really smart.

1054
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,440
Even under so much pressure from us,

1055
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,880
he didn't reveal himself.

1056
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,080
We tried to trick the poisoner into exposing themselves.

1057
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,920
Yeah, but we didn't manage to do it just now.

1058
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,800
But it's not like we

1059
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,040
were trying to act all mysterious.

1060
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,600
Really?

1061
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,840
Did you guys know just now

1062
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,760
that the poisoner was actually the murderer?

1063
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,960
Who would know that?

1064
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,360
We didn't know.

1065
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,160
Who could have known?

1066
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,160
Is it really that complicated?

1067
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,120
I'm telling you, even I didn't know.

1068
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,480
If we had managed to trick them out just now, that would have been amazing.

1069
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:40,840
Seriously.

1070
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
So steady, like a veteran.

1071
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,360
Who can be that steady, like an old "dog"?

1072
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,680
So logically now,

1073
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,560
it means she and I have already been ruled out.

1074
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,400
So only those two are left?

1075
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,480
Bro, why are you ruled out?

1076
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
I'm definitely ruled out.

1077
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,080
I don't think you're definitely ruled out.

1078
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,800
We've already confirmed one thing.

1079
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,000
That is, the culprit

1080
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
must have seen what's inside the shredder

1081
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,400
to commit this crime.

1082
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,680
Right.

1083
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,880
And in my room,

1084
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,440
there's the other half of the shredder.

1085
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,800
If I saw the top half of the shredder,

1086
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,240
No.

1087
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,520
No.

1088
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,120
This is to rule out him using water to drown.

1089
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,480
It's me who saw the contents of the shredder.

1090
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,800
I know that's what he wanted to do.

1091
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,240
But your method was poisoning.

1092
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,600
Poisoning doesn't require looking inside the shredder at all.

1093
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,320
So the suspects are still the three of you.

1094
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,200
No one's definitely ruled out.

1095
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,400
No one's definitely ruled out.

1096
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,520
Makes sense.

1097
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,440
My intuition was right.

1098
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,960
In my opinion,

1099
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,680
when I thought it was a drowning,

1100
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,400
I was definitely ruled out.

1101
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,120
Yes, but now I've already stepped out.

1102
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,960
Now you've stepped out.

1103
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,600
Right, so sit down.

1104
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,600
Sit down.

1105
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,960
I think

1106
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,640
I'll sit down.

1107
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,840
What they said is right.

1108
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
What they said is right.

1109
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,480
Impressive.

1110
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,360
You actually pulled me back in again.

1111
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,960
Yeah.

1112
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,960
We previously overlooked one point.

1113
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,880
The person who pushed the first and second victim is the same.

1114
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,480
Right?

1115
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:10,840
Yes.

1116
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,480
Among the motives of the four suspects,

1117
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,360
each person's motive is definitely different.

1118
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,400
Some people targeted the first victim.

1119
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,600
Some people targeted the second victim.

1120
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,840
So, among you four, who knows

1121
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,560
that the first and second victim are actually the same person?

1122
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,160
Only those who entered that secret room

1123
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
All the evidence points to the first victim.

1124
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,920
When it comes to the second victim,

1125
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,080
it happened after entering the secret room.

1126
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,400
Captain Dash's clothes.

1127
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,240
Hearing loss in both ears, blurred vision.

1128
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,040
Arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis.

1129
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,640
The same person.

1130
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,320
Exactly the same.

1131
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,760
Only those who have entered the secret room know this.

1132
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,120
Only those who have been in the secret room can be sure.

1133
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,000
That the first and second victim are the same person.

1134
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:53,920
That's right.

1135
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,200
So, among your four motives,

1136
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,080
who wanted to kill the first victim?

1137
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,600
I wanted to kill the first victim.

1138
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
According to the current clues, he and she

1139
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,520
Yes, the two of you wanted to kill

1140
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
the first victim.

1141
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,440
So, which of you two entered the secret room?

1142
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,520
I haven't.

1143
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,960
I haven't entered either.

1144
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,840
That old medicine of yours.

1145
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,360
Where did you find this medicine?

1146
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,560
I didn't find it.

1147
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,840
I saw it in his pocket.

1148
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,120
How did you know about this medicine?

1149
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,800
Where did you see it?

1150
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,080
After I saw it, I searched for it online.

1151
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,800
What is this medicine for?

1152
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,560
Where did you see it?

1153
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,880
In his pocket.

1154
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,640
I saw that medicine in his pocket.

1155
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,240
That medicine.

1156
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,040
Medicine.

1157
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,520
I just wanted to ask what this is.

1158
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,760
Then I went back and searched online.

1159
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,040
When I entered that secret room,

1160
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,520
the medicine was on the bedside.

1161
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,560
It wasn't in the pocket.

1162
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,840
Give me a "Laonianbao" pill.

1163
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,080
He went in.

1164
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
He took it in with him.

1165
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,760
I often see him go into the secret room.

1166
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,880
So you knew there was a secret room.

1167
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,920
Yes, I knew.

1168
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,240
So I went around to look through the window.

1169
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,920
Did you know there was a secret room?

1170
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,320
I didn't know.

1171
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,080
Someone is lying.

1172
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,680
One of those two definitely knows.

1173
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,600
There's a secret room here.

1174
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,320
Why?

1175
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,120
Guys,

1176
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,600
That secret room is right on the wall of his room.

1177
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,680
Every time after I finish performing,

1178
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,160
when I go to him for his signature to get paid,

1179
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,960
he always brings a strange bottle

1180
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,120
and goes into a room in his study.

1181
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,880
That secret room is right next to his window.

1182
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,440
It's right next to his room.

1183
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,360
There's a door.

1184
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,120
There's a door.

1185
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,320
A door.

1186
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,040
A door.

1187
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,200
But I think this actually clears her.

1188
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,920
Because she directly mentioned the secret room.

1189
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,680
Otherwise, she could have hidden that.

1190
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,200
Because just now we were fully suspecting Ba.

1191
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,520
Right?

1192
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:08,880
That's right.

1193
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,680
But we found we couldn't really move forward, right?

1194
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,200
Because she blurted out

1195
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,400
"I know he has a secret room,"

1196
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,560
so we would think

1197
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,760
she's already revealed the secret room.

1198
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,240
Okay, so now let's deduce.

1199
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,720
Let's focus our suspicion on Bai.

1200
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,200
No problem.

1201
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,800
What time did you get here?

1202
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,280
What did you do?

1203
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,560
I arrived at the mansion at 2:30.

1204
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
I met Ning at reception and needed to change clothes.

1205
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,280
Then I was given the keys to rooms two and four.

1206
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,160
I was told to get some rest.

1207
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,120
So I went back to my room.

1208
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,760
Didn't I arrange to meet someone

1209
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,640
who was coming to the mansion to buy a painting?

1210
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,520
Then I started

1211
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,920
painting right away.

1212
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,240
After painting for a while,

1213
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,320
I remembered that shipwreck.

1214
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
It felt as if

1215
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,960
something was guiding me here.

1216
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,280
So I wanted to see

1217
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,400
if I could find any

1218
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,320
evidence from the shipwreck.

1219
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,080
Any clues or traces.

1220
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,560
I started searching around.

1221
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,840
At 16:35,

1222
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,560
I went to the reception area, but no one was there.

1223
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,560
I found the study key there.

1224
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,680
I took the key and entered the study.

1225
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,920
I looked around inside.

1226
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,400
I found a delivery box in the trash can.

1227
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,160
It was that "Senior Treasure" thing.

1228
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,920
So I took it.

1229
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,600
There was a door in the study that I couldn't open.

1230
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,240
So you discovered the secret room.

1231
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,800
That door wouldn't open.

1232
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,400
I didn't know what it was.

1233
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,240
You're lying.

1234
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,920
You two are still contradicting each other.

1235
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,400
Like this.

1236
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
That's what he said.

1237
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,040
I saw it too, but I have doubts.

1238
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,760
But he said he never went in either.

1239
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,040
I don't know, he's just passing the blame.

1240
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,320
So I don't want to kill him either.

1241
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,760
That's the same as what you said.

1242
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,280
So we can only rely on you two

1243
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,400
and use other time clues to figure this out.

1244
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,400
So many pills.

1245
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,680
He usually takes a lot of supplements.

1246
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,240
He wants to live longer.

1247
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,320
Look.

1248
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,360
If we conclude

1249
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,480
that he was poisoned,

1250
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,160
the killer must have known

1251
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,000
that I put the poison in this syrup.

1252
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,800
He would definitely take it.

1253
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,400
I get it now.

1254
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,600
He was already dying.

1255
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,720
The doctor told him he was going to die.

1256
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,160
But I think he would strictly

1257
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,720
take all these health supplements.

1258
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,200
And I think

1259
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,120
someone must have known about this habit

1260
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,480
a long time in advance.

1261
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,080
It's not like I just entered the secret room today

1262
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,600
and found out he was the same person

1263
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,280
and knew he would take these longevity pills.

1264
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,400
I couldn't have

1265
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
carried out the plan so perfectly.

1266
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,160
It had to be someone who knew about his habit long ago.

1267
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,240
Actually, if we follow his

1268
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,960
logic,

1269
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,200
it does seem more like Ning.

1270
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,120
More like Ning.

1271
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,840
More like me.

1272
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,120
I didn't say "you" in the polite form.

1273
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,600
"Ning," not "you" (formal).

1274
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,920
Right.

1275
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,480
You're X today, right?

1276
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:42,720
What?

1277
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,680
You should be X today, right?

1278
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,840
If I were...

1279
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,280
You just tried to pin it on me.

1280
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,560
Whether I entered the secret room or not doesn't matter.

1281
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,680
Because I only decided to do it today on a whim.

1282
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
To kill him.

1283
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
I want to tell everyone

1284
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,160
an even stranger motive.

1285
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,600
If I knew

1286
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,320
he wanted to kill me,

1287
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,440
I could just leave with my daughter.

1288
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,360
Why would I have to kill him?

1289
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,280
Why would I still participate?

1290
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,840
To be honest,

1291
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,760
someone like me,

1292
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,920
I think it's you.

1293
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,200
Because I might not acknowledge you.

1294
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,920
It doesn't matter if you don't acknowledge me.

1295
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,080
I'll just do my best

1296
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,240
to ruin this gathering.

1297
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
Because my goal is to save you.

1298
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,320
Today he told me to quack like a duck three times.

1299
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,400
I refused.

1300
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,040
If the boat is here, I'll smash it with a hammer.

1301
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,840
If I ruin this ending, that's it.

1302
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,440
Why would I want to kill him?

1303
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,160
I think that's a strong point.

1304
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,640
Makes sense. He could just leave.

1305
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,720
I could just leave.

1306
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,240
Let me tell you,

1307
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,080
you're my daughter, and I'm your father.

1308
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,640
Listen,

1309
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,600
there's some kind of sunflower behind you.

1310
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,760
We would have recognized each other.

1311
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,840
Right? So why would I want to protect you

1312
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,680
and get myself involved in all this?

1313
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,480
He's just making threats.

1314
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,240
You two are the real enemies.

1315
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:55,920
Right.

1316
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,680
But there's one thing,

1317
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,000
I still can't rule out Ning.

1318
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,320
The person who poisoned him

1319
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,400
must know his daily routine.

1320
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,560
And know how he mixes this.

1321
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,120
And that he eats it at dinner.

1322
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,800
I think what Ning said at the end was pretty

1323
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,600
I think so too.

1324
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,920
What he said convinced me.

1325
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,560
So let's vote.

1326
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:14,960
Let's vote.

1327
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,560
Go ahead and vote.

1328
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,280
In my heart,

1329
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,760
because I know for sure she's not the one.

1330
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,720
It's simple for me.

1331
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,880
I have a good idea about those two as well.

1332
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,640
From my perspective,

1333
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,520
it's a choice between Bai and Ba.

1334
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,800
It's a one-out-of-two result.

1335
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,200
But both of them know

1336
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,520
that pushing Houlang means pushing Qianlang.

1337
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,000
And they know he needs to take health supplements.

1338
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
So, with only two options,

1339
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,160
I had no choice but to vote for

1340
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,120
Bai.

1341
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,640
I hope that in this third round,

1342
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
I won't be wrong three times in a row—no one else has done that.

1343
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,680
Bai is here.

1344
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,600
Everyone,

1345
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,080
we absolutely can't get it wrong.

1346
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,640
That's it.

1347
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,200
The crime process:

1348
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,880
poisoning.

1349
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,320
Today, my vote is for

1350
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,680
because he is the most likely

1351
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,720
person to know about the secret room.

1352
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,280
The culprit I chose today is

1353
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,640
He knows about pushing Houlang's

1354
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,360
daily routine,

1355
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,120
and the time he takes his medicine.

1356
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,160
He also had many opportunities

1357
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,800
to get the poison.

1358
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,480
My chosen culprit is

1359
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,560
someone who used the pre-prepared "Du Lai Du Wang" poison

1360
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,280
and put it into his usual supplements.

1361
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,360
And during the banquet,

1362
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,800
the victim took the poison, and twelve hours later

1363
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,840
died from the poisoning.

1364
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,440
Today, my chosen culprit is

1365
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,400
The suspect I voted for is

1366
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,280
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1367
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,960
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

1368
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,040
Next, we move on to

1369
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,800
Tongcheng Travel's moment of truth

1370
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm really scared

1371
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,160
I hope I voted correctly

1372
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,200
In today's case

1373
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,920
The suspects are

1374
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,720
Ba Jiaoshan

1375
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,360
Jin Shangbao

1376
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,440
Baizhihua

1377
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,520
Ning Jiedai

1378
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,360
Among the four people

1379
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,360
Three received votes

1380
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,520
All three suspects got votes

1381
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,280
That's right

1382
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,000
Ning Jiedai received votes

1383
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,920
Then the culprit voted for me

1384
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,400
The one who got no votes is

1385
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,960
Jin Shangbao

1386
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,920
Good voting

1387
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,760
The three players received

1388
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,800
respectively

1389
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,240
one vote

1390
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,480
two votes

1391
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,000
and three votes

1392
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,800
One, two, three

1393
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,880
The person who got one vote is

1394
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,520
Ning

1395
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,920
Ning Jiedai

1396
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,000
If I guess wrong again this round

1397
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,880
I won't come to record next time

1398
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,480
You have one vote.

1399
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,320
I have one vote.

1400
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,480
You have two votes.

1401
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,200
How many votes do I have?

1402
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,920
There's one with two votes, and one with three votes.

1403
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,600
No.

1404
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,040
Speechless.

1405
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,120
It's really not me.

1406
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,280
You're still acting? There's no need.

1407
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,240
You're acting so well.

1408
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,840
It's really not me.

1409
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,760
Who will open it for me?

1410
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm going to "die" here.

1411
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,360
Don't.

1412
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,240
I haven't said it yet.

1413
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,840
You're about to win, why "die"?

1414
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,360
You're about to win.

1415
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,400
You're about to win.

1416
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,000
Announce it, seriously.

1417
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,760
The person who got three votes is...

1418
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Just get it over with.

1419
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,000
Ba Jiaoshan.

1420
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,560
Who? How many votes?

1421
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,240
Ba Jiaoshan.

1422
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,840
Three votes.

1423
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,800
You got three votes.

1424
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,000
My vote today is...

1425
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,160
My suspect is Ba...

1426
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,600
Today I...

1427
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,040
The suspect I chose is...

1428
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,000
Ba Jiaoshan.

1429
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,600
Motive.

1430
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,960
It's to avenge her Baba Liu.

1431
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,560
The suspect I voted for is...

1432
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,200
Baizhihua.

1433
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,600
My suspect is...

1434
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,680
Ning Jiedai.

1435
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,360
The motive is to save her daughter.

1436
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,120
Today, my suspect is...

1437
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,520
Ba Jiaoshan.

1438
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,280
I give up.

1439
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,640
Which one of you?

1440
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,480
Which one of you?

1441
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,960
This side really isn't innocent.

1442
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,240
Which one of you?

1443
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,760
Not innocent.

1444
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,400
No, it's not me.

1445
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,800
We won.

1446
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,080
We won.

1447
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,400
We won.

1448
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,360
You're still acting.

1449
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,160
It's not me.

1450
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,800
You're still acting.

1451
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,680
I just want to hit you today.

1452
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,120
I really want to hit you today.

1453
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,200
Hold him down for me.

1454
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,120
Wait a second.

1455
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,960
Don't rush.

1456
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,720
No, wait for the announcement first.

1457
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,240
He hasn't revealed the culprit yet.

1458
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,880
Hurry up, announce it.

1459
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,680
Hurry up.

1460
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,480
The real culprit of this case

1461
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,440
is it really Ba Jiaoshan?

1462
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,600
I don't dare listen.

1463
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,760
Wait, why does she have that expression?

1464
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,080
Everyone today

1465
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,080
locked in their suspect.

1466
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,880
If I can't guess it right this round,

1467
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,720
I won't come to record the next episode.

1468
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,400
Failure.

1469
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,120
I really...

1470
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,440
Who? Hurry up and raise your hand.

1471
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,160
Three people.

1472
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,280
These three, come out.

1473
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,800
Who?

1474
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,720
Me.

1475
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,640
Who?

1476
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:31,880
You.

1477
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,600
Raise your hand.

1478
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:32,960
Who else?

1479
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,400
Anyone else?

1480
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,560
You. Who else?

1481
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,480
Me.

1482
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,200
It's you.

1483
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,240
You're the culprit.

1484
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,400
You two planned this.

1485
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:38,920
Why?

1486
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,040
You two agreed on this.

1487
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,440
I had to choose between two.

1488
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,360
I picked randomly, couldn't help it.

1489
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,640
Couldn't help it.

1490
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,360
What do you mean, couldn't help it?

1491
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,800
The real culprit is...

1492
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,800
No way.

1493
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,200
If I can't guess it right this round,

1494
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,080
I won't come to record the next episode.

1495
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,480
The real culprit is...

1496
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,400
Blank paper drawing

1497
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,880
I can come record next episode.

1498
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,680
I guessed right.

1499
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,680
Me too.

1500
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,040
I finally guessed right.

1501
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,360
Only the two of us voted for him, right?

1502
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,800
Only the two of us voted for him.

1503
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,360
Bro, why did you vote for me?

1504
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,200
Why did you vote for me?

1505
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,840
Well, look,

1506
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,880
If I listened to you,

1507
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,800
I'd get tricked by you again, right?

1508
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,120
Right.

1509
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,360
Bro, whoever you vote for this round, I'll vote for too.

1510
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,480
Vote without thinking.

1511
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,320
Don't question my big bro.

1512
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,800
If there's a problem, come at me.

1513
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,280
No way, big bro.

1514
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,560
I'm still going to follow your vote this round.

1515
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,320
Whoever you vote for, I vote for.

1516
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,000
I vote for you.

1517
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,320
If you vote for me, then I'll vote for myself.

1518
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:37,920
Okay.

1519
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,640
Bro, you need to point me in a direction.

1520
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,760
He's trying to pull me over to his side.

1521
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,680
Yeah, a truly good person

1522
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,760
wouldn't play like this.

1523
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,320
I have a summary about him.

1524
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,440
Because someone who acts like this

1525
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,000
We can define him in four words.

1526
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,040
Either "dumb" or "bad".

1527
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,240
He's not "dumb".

1528
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,040
He can only be

1529
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,480
absolutely "bad".

1530
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:53,920
"Bad".

1531
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,560
So you're just a pure "bad guy".

1532
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,480
You're really "bad".

1533
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,680
Who would want to be your brother?

1534
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,040
I'm speechless.

1535
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,160
No.

1536
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,600
Then why did you want to kill him?

1537
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,320
Did you already know he was that...

1538
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,120
...his father, right?

1539
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:11,880
Of course.

1540
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,120
Have you been to the secret room?

1541
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,600
Of course.

1542
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,320
So, was there an X today?

1543
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,640
Yes.

1544
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,720
Yes, they're even eating candy.

1545
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,200
Definitely.

1546
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,040
They're eating wedding candy, it must be those two.

1547
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:26,760
I have some too.

1548
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,040
Want some?

1549
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,400
Let's just...

1550
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,480
...each take out our own.

1551
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,880
Let's make a toast.

1552
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,120
Cheers.

1553
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,600
Cheers.

1554
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,360
Cheers.

1555
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:32,560
Alright.

1556
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,720
You two are even enjoying the fruits of victory.

1557
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,920
Has Ke Wuwang confirmed his identity?

1558
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,680
Who would want to be your brother?

1559
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,040
Alright, at least we're not embarrassed now.

1560
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,280
At least we made the right choice.

1561
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,640
I can finally restore my reputation from the last round.

1562
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,720
Even though I didn't get the key,

1563
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,360
I'm still very happy.

1564
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,040
Me too.

1565
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,480
Yeah.

1566
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,400
The crucial evidence everyone missed today

1567
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,120
was actually always in Baizhihua's phone.

1568
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,840
He has an unboxing video.

1569
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,240
No.

1570
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:12,760
No.

1571
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,800
It's in his social media app.

1572
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,920
In the wallet for small change.

1573
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,360
There are transaction details for small change.

1574
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,200
He has records of quick purchases from "Du Lai Du Wang."

1575
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,880
What is that?

1576
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,120
I opened his Moments.

1577
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,800
Someone opened his WeChat.

1578
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,560
I opened it.

1579
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,120
I opened it—I opened his Moments.

1580
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,880
But I didn't find anything.

1581
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,680
I didn't check the wallet either.

1582
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,200
There's also the wallet.

1583
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,080
His phone.

1584
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,360
We haven't made any progress at all.

1585
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,160
How could something like this still happen?

1586
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,080
Yes.

1587
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,120
This is a bit dangerous, to be honest.

1588
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,400
Someone put this poison

1589
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,640
into the syrup.

1590
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,640
Someone poisoned his wine glass.

1591
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,320
Is that possible?

1592
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,280
If that's the case,

1593
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,680
could it have been three people?

1594
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,320
Why?

1595
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,040
Because he ended up dying in the water.

1596
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,320
Isn't that unnecessary?

1597
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,800
Then how do we determine

1598
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,080
what actually killed him?

1599
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,560
Wasn't his body blackened?

1600
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,800
But even if he drowned,

1601
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,680
he would still turn black.

1602
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,240
Because he drank the poison.

1603
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,120
Both of you wanted to kill Tui Qianlang.

1604
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,040
So which of you entered the secret room?

1605
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,920
But I think this actually clears her.

1606
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,640
Because she directly mentioned the secret room.

1607
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,400
Otherwise, she could have hidden that fact.

1608
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
You two are still contradicting each other.

1609
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,280
Like this.

1610
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,480
That's what he said.

1611
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,920
I saw it too, and I have doubts.

1612
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,640
But he said he didn't go in either.

1613
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,920
I also didn't know he was Tui Qianlang.

1614
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,200
So I don't want to kill him either.

1615
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,640
That's the same as what you said.

1616
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,000
The killer must have known

1617
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,760
that I put the poison in the syrup.

1618
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,880
He would definitely eat it.

1619
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,280
They were familiar with his habits.

1620
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,520
Actually, if we follow his logic,

1621
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,040
then,

1622
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,240
it does seem more like Ning.

1623
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,480
Please have He Chongchong present the golden keys to the two of them.

1624
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,320
Impressive.

1625
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,840
Alright, go ahead and "humiliate" me again.

1626
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,160
You don't have a golden key.

1627
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,080
No, they won.

1628
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:14,920
Come on.

1629
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,040
The two brothers.

1630
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,160
Come here.

1631
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,560
Thank you.

1632
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,240
You let us win.

1633
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,440
We won.

1634
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,200
Thanks to you.

1635
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,000
Thanks to you.

1636
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,040
Thanks to me.

1637
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,840
Yes, thanks to your vote.

1638
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,040
I admit defeat.

1639
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,240
Why do you think she's not the one?

1640
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:31,760
She's not the culprit.

1641
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,320
She was right there.

1642
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,680
I'm not.

1643
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,680
It's so obvious.

1644
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,000
I even sang.

1645
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:38,960
If you don't vote for me,

1646
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,280
we really won today.

1647
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,080
It's true, I didn't vote for you.

1648
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:41,760
I definitely voted for him.

1649
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,440
Because I think she's definitely not it.

1650
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:43,760
Yeah.

1651
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,760
Then it's a three-to-three tie for them.

1652
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,880
It's three to three.

1653
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,520
That means we win.

1654
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,080
It's me.

1655
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,640
It's you.

1656
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,840
The outcome depended on the issue with you.

1657
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,040
Luckily, your votes got split today.

1658
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,160
Seriously, it's lucky today.

1659
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,200
Jin's votes got split.

1660
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,920
Yeah.

1661
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Otherwise, it would have been a tie.

1662
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,280
Yeah.

1663
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,520
It would have been three votes each for Ba and you.

1664
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:01,840
Yeah.

1665
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,880
Let's announce the current Golden Key rankings.

1666
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,920
Tied for first place are

1667
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,520
Bai and Ke.

1668
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,880
Tied for second place are

1669
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,160
Ba, Jin, and He.

1670
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,800
Ba, Jin, and He sounds really good.

1671
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,360
Put your hand down.

1672
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,320
In third place is Ning.

1673
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,200
That's so miserable.

1674
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,600
So miserable, this is just too miserable.

1675
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,240
I found my daughter.

1676
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,160
I found my adopted son.

1677
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,840
I acknowledged my goddaughter today.

1678
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,360
Yes.

1679
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,360
And then my daughter-in-law, Qi Ji...

1680
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,600
I still don't know where she is.

1681
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,560
When I came back again,

1682
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,760
I found that she and her daughter had disappeared.

1683
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,240
You might never find your wife again.

1684
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,520
Why?

1685
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,440
Right, I have a suspicion about that...

1686
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,520
The glowing person.

1687
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:49,960
The glowing person.

1688
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,440
The glowing person.

1689
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,600
Yes, that's right.

1690
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,240
And also the boss of Tui Qianlang.

1691
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,920
He ordered him to become the captain.

1692
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,120
The one who was to sail this ship.

1693
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,800
The boss told me to sink everyone on the ship.

1694
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,640
And also that...

1695
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,960
We still haven't found our treasure.

1696
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,440
It's on a mysterious island.

1697
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,800
The treasure left by Tui Sanniang is hidden there.

1698
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,480
Tui Sanniang's treasure, yes.

1699
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,040
Yes, and also the person who just arrived.

1700
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,680
I'm Ren Weishan.

1701
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,720
Tui Houlang sent me here.

1702
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:14,560
That's right.

1703
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,200
Ren Weishan.

1704
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,240
Yes.

1705
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,840
I'm a bit hungry.

1706
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,360
Let's go back to our rooms for now and freshen up.

1707
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,160
Then at 10:30,

1708
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,520
let's have a late-night snack in the banquet hall.

1709
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:24,960
Okay.

1710
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,320
Okay.

1711
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,800
No problem.

1712
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,080
Let's go.

1713
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:27,520
Alright.

1714
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,040
Pretending to be the new wave pushing the old one forward

1715
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,960
Always thinking about how to live longer

1716
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,680
But in the end, getting trapped in time and unable to escape

1717
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,480
In fact, the true value of life

1718
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,640
is never about counting how many days we've lived

1719
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,080
but about counting, among these days,

1720
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,880
how many moments we were truly alive

1721
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,840
We will definitely face all kinds of challenges

1722
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,880
and difficulties

1723
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,000
But I think

1724
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,080
it's precisely because of these difficulties and challenges

1725
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,400
that we can grow and improve

1726
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,560
Growing from youth to old age is

1727
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,800
a completely natural process

1728
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,120
Blindly pursuing

1729
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,080
things that are not

1730
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,600
what you should be seeking at this stage

1731
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,680
can easily lead you astray

1732
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,520
Just like trying to push the old wave

1733
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,240
using some extreme methods

1734
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,080
to pursue things

1735
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,720
that don't belong to this stage of life

1736
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,280
in the first place

1737
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,560
In the end, it backfires on yourself

1738
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,440
He did it all to achieve immortality

1739
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,680
and created deadly traps

1740
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,000
His desires only grew stronger

1741
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,240
Greed is like a dagger

1742
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,520
At first, it may only

1743
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,560
scratch the edge of morality

1744
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,920
But if left unchecked

1745
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,680
it will cut deeper and deeper

1746
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,080
and eventually hurt others

1747
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,760
and even ourselves

1748
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,480
Immediate interests can easily

1749
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,160
make people lose their way

1750
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,520
But we must remember

1751
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,120
any gain at the expense of others

1752
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,600
is never worth it

1753
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,480
On the surface, this "pushing the younger generation" seems to be

1754
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,080
a young and promising mansion owner.

1755
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,120
But all of this is just

1756
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,720
a carefully crafted disguise.

1757
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,880
In reality, his true intention is to sacrifice others.

1758
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,600
He is actually "pushing the older generation."

1759
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,840
It's just like in our daily lives,

1760
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,400
when you interact with others,

1761
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,200
even if you think someone is a good person,

1762
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,000
you should always

1763
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,200
maintain a certain level of caution.

1764
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,840
And I want to say one more thing to everyone:

1765
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,880
One should not harbor the intention to harm others.

1766
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,120
But one must always be vigilant against being harmed.

1767
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,680
Maintain a reasonable level of caution.

1768
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,840
But don't become indifferent.

1769
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,680
You should put a lock on your kindness.

1770
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,760
There are no shortcuts in life.

1771
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,080
True progress comes from

1772
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,319
down-to-earth research and practice.

1773
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,160
For example,

1774
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,279
breakthroughs in medicine help us overcome diseases.

1775
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,720
Technological innovation makes life more convenient.

1776
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,840
These achievements are the result of countless people's efforts

1777
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,160
and wisdom.

1778
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,880
Everyone has their own desires.

1779
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,680
For instance, we might want to buy clothes,

1780
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,319
or buy food,

1781
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,920
or wish for better living conditions.

1782
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,880
These are all

1783
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,120
normal desires and needs for everyone.

1784
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,680
We should learn to regulate our desires,

1785
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,640
and let them motivate us to move forward,

1786
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,880
instead of letting these desires

1787
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,080
destroy your life.

1788
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,160
Face your desires honestly,

1789
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,000
and let reasonable desires drive the gears of fate forward,

1790
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,840
rather than

1791
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,399
letting greedy desires ruin your life.

1792
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,520
Yes, we see this "pushing the next generation" person,

1793
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,840
who gains immortality at the cost of others' lives.

1794
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,000
He seeks to achieve eternal life for himself.

1795
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,880
The most likely crime he would be charged with

1796
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,720
would of course be intentional homicide.

1797
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,479
If his actions are motivated by

1798
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,080
such a despicable motive,

1799
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,319
like in the case we're discussing today,

1800
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:17,960
in this kind of situation,

1801
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,640
including his targets,

1802
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,399
if they are vulnerable groups,

1803
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,960
Including his location

1804
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,240
For example, if it was in a public place

1805
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,600
Then these factors will affect his sentencing

1806
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,439
In our case

1807
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,960
He has such a despicable motive

1808
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,680
At this point

1809
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,200
His sentence might be heavier

1810
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,479
Wait, my door is locked

1811
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,080
I'm locked in

1812
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,240
I've already used tools to open your

1813
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,520
windows

1814
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,479
The last supper

1815
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,680
Our boss, Ren Weishan

1816
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,399
disappeared after eating the late-night snack

1817
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,880
Did you get rid of him?

1818
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,520
Impossible

1819
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,840
Why would we get rid of him?

1820
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,960
We went to sleep

1821
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,440
If you want to redeem yourselves

1822
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,480
then go look for him

1823
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,280
Your boss is here

1824
01:09:59,280 --> 01:09:59,880
Found him

1825
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,880
The boss has been found

1826
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,560
Bring him up

1827
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,680
I think now all of you

1828
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,680
are a bit suspicious

1829
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,640
Take turns and talk about your relationship with the boss

1830
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,440
I had some kind of deal with him.

1831
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,520
A deal?

1832
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,200
What kind of deal?

1833
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,920
I hope that when you read these words,

1834
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,360
you can forgive me for deceiving you.

1835
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,640
I took his identity.

1836
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,040
I came to Tui City University.

1837
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,080
To study in the entomology department.

1838
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,360
I must kill him.

1839
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,200
To eliminate future trouble.

1840
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,320
This move is straightforward—

1841
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
cutting off the problem at its root.

1842
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,520
The black market's abandoned baby tower.

1843
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,880
Because she was a girl,

1844
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,080
you abandoned her at the baby tower.

1845
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,280
I started thinking of a foolproof plan.

1846
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,280
I want to kill him.

1847
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,280
Gives me goosebumps.

1848
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,680
He ruined this.

1849
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,280
I must get revenge.

1850
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,920
So,

1851
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,720
you killed him.

1852
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,160
At that moment, the intent to kill arose.

1853
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,880
If the lighthouse hasn't arrived yet,

1854
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,400
even an isolated island can venture into the mountains and seas.

1855
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Why is this red on you?

1856
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,040
This must be blood.

1857
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,880
This isn't from me.

1858
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,280
This is starting to give you away.

1859
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:46,920
Wait a second.

1860
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,800
Then we all have alibis.

1861
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,400
It must have been after he left.

1862
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,920
The timing started to go wrong.

1863
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,440
The memory point in our minds

1864
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
is exactly forty minutes.

1865
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,520
It's all mixed up.

1866
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,920
Each of you has a different timeline.

1867
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,080
I've got goosebumps.

1868
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,560
Bro,

1869
01:10:59,560 --> 01:10:59,880
I get it.

1870
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,400
It wasn't me.

1871
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:00,880
Still acting?

1872
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,760
So each of you

1873
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,680
doesn't even know if you're really the culprit.

1874
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,320
That's awesome.

1875
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,880
Look, my hands are already like this.

1876
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,360
This is what I'll look like when I'm old.

1877
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,520
Bro,

1878
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,760
is this right?

1879
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,600
Bro,

1880
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,200
I'm the real culprit in this case.

1881
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,120
There's no one in the room.

1882
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,400
I quickly checked.

1883
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,600
I found two medical reports.

1884
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,160
I was thinking about what method to use

1885
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,000
to kill him without anyone noticing.

1886
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,480
And get away with it perfectly.

1887
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,640
Ning,

1888
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,320
Big Dad,

1889
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,920
You want to join my family too?

1890
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,760
He's acting like everyone's dad on this show now.

1891
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,800
Today, he's basically been everyone's dad.

1892
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,160
Except for me.

1893
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,200
Don't worry, you can't escape.

1894
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,160
No.

1895
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,040
Tomorrow, you'll find out

1896
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,320
that you're another child I gave birth to.

1897
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,480
The chili in your mouth is biting you.

1898
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,960
Look how greedy you are.

1899
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,840
You just had to eat this.

1900
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,400
It's delicious.

1901
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,040
It's so spicy I can't take it.
