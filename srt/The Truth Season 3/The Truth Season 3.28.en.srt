1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,480
Billion Push

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,640
A director who created a box office legend worth billions

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,160
Legendary director

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,600
Legendary director

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,400
Billion Push Film Company

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,840
Every time filming starts

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,760
it captures the attention of the entire industry

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,680
A mysterious kingdom

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,880
Here to audition for the male lead

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,280
He also discovered my talent

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,600
I once acted in one of his works

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
I am the actress he personally selected

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
He discovered my artist's talent

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,360
I'm just here to audition for his project

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,240
Recently, rumors have been swirling

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,280
Billion Push is about to launch a major new project

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,360
As soon as the news broke

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
The industry was stirred up again

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,920
The year 2024

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
Outstanding graduate of Push Arts Academy

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,720
Six people were invited to audition.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,080
However,

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
when they arrived at the agreed audition time with Tui Baiyi,

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,400
at the scheduled audition time,

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,400
what awaited them

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,840
was the news of Tui Baiyi's death.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,360
What secrets are hidden behind this?

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,280
The fall of a legendary director,

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,520
a thrilling audition,

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,040
and a mysterious drama both on and off stage.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,640
The curtain rises,

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,600
and the truth awaits to be revealed.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,320
After a preliminary investigation,

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,760
the people involved in this case have been identified.

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,520
I am the 2024 Tuiyi Star.

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
My name is Prince Baima.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
That's all.

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,880
Very aloof.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,640
Just like his name.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,160
He is also very charismatic.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,240
You are very charismatic.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
So handsome.

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,080
Why does he look so good?

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Very charismatic.

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,800
I like seeing you frown so tightly.

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Calling you a coward.

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
If I relax now, I'll just roll away.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
I don't believe it. Relax, then.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,840
You roll.

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,440
That means you rolled down with a cloth over you.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,880
Then how did the cloth stay up there?

52
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
The person came down.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
And the cloth went back by itself.

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,560
That one is five minutes.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,400
After five minutes, he died.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,880
Then tell me,

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
if he wanted to extend that time,

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
when he woke up, just shake him a bit.

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
Hold him steady.

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,080
It's not impossible.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
Just woke up.

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,800
Do you four have anything

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
you want to defend yourselves about?

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
I hate it most when petty people are in charge.

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Seriously, me too.

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Fine, you have a problem.

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,920
Okay, refute me.

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
If you don't explain properly again,

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
you're really in trouble this time.

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
So basically, this matter is

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,200
knowing about this,

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
the fact that someone was killed.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,320
So he wanted to use this opportunity

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
to take this

75
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,440
and change it into

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
He wanted

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,280
to make it seem like the boss knew he killed someone.

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
He went to the office first.

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
He had already seen it.

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,120
So he covered it with black liquid.

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Right.

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah.

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,320
That's how it was from the start.

84
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,160
Move aside, move aside, the detectives are here.

85
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
The two of us are detectives.

86
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
This isn't an ordinary stone.

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
There's one without a signature.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
It must be this director.

89
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
Then this person had a motive.

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Killed him.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
The boss must have found out.

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,960
Which one is the culprit?

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
He took this.

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,800
It's him.

95
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,279
It's definitely him.

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
Tell me, why are you the Painted Skin Ghost?

97
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Handsome.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Shooting a commercial.

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
These chat logs are with her best friend.

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
You wouldn't be able to handle it.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Of course I can't handle it.

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,720
Can you handle it?

103
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
This is a golden reputation and...

104
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
I want you to say it.

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,640
You were the one who flirted first.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,040
You bumped into someone and passed out.

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
Aren't we friends?

108
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Listen to Dad.

109
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Don't let her get hurt.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,880
My name is Ba Mian Linglong, director.

111
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,440
I was the Promoting Art Star of 2021.

112
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,640
I was born in 2002.

113
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm so happy.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Just so lovable.

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Sparkling and lovable.

116
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Love at first sight.

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
Then I confessed to her.

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,400
About her,

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
She stayed by my side for years as a friend.

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
I walked in the rain with her.

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
Since then, I started looking forward to rainy days.

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,240
Yes.

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes.

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
He could be my assistant.

125
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,120
Willing to do anything for me.

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,200
He also really likes me.

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,960
Ice cubes.

128
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,960
He drank poison.

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,280
That lipstick murder case.

130
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
Isn't there a kind of punishment like that?

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,840
It's covering with this thing and pouring in water.

132
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,960
Pouring water, right.

133
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Did he drink it?

134
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
One more sip and he could survive.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Is that what it means?

136
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
Sometimes that's just how it is.

137
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
That's life.

138
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,080
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

139
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Maybe he heard it at the bathroom door.

140
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
Maybe that bathroom

141
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,120
is connected.

142
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Brother Cheng.

143
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,480
Do you have any money?

144
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,520
Do you have money?

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,200
Right.

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
You all can actually understand.

147
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
She understood, she remembered.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,280
Right.

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,840
Let's leave it at that.

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,480
I

151
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,760
Please

152
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
My name is Jin Zi Zhaopai

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
I am the actress he personally selected

154
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,800
He should have seen some of my work

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
You are doing an audition

156
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,440
I have already been confirmed as the female lead

157
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
Because I am a future star

158
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
He was the one who pursued you at first

159
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
Yes, he pursued me

160
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,200
I reluctantly agreed to be with him

161
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,640
I don't know why, he just ignores me

162
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,360
You acted like this with other guys before

163
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
There was a rift in our relationship

164
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
It's because of you

165
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,880
Is there no pure friendship between men and women?

166
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
He's a friend, right?

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,680
If I save him

168
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,920
I think I would be in danger too

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you agree?

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
You've worked with the boss many times

171
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,320
You are his...

172
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,840
The boss and I...

173
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,160
The boss just personally selected me

174
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
It's possible

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
Go take care of things for her

176
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
What?

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,760
There is leverage

178
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,200
You, being smart, noticed

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
Your eyes flashed

180
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920
You planned everything in just five minutes

181
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,680
Why do you seem a bit nervous and uncomfortable?

182
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
I feel like you...

183
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,080
I really think you're a bit nervous and uncomfortable

184
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,160
Okay

185
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
I would rather have nothing than settle for less.

186
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm also our 2024

187
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Star of Talent Promotion.

188
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,520
And I'm also Ba Mian Linglong's assistant.

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Loving you is a lonely secret.

190
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,880
Listen to Baba.

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,520
Don't let her get hurt.

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,840
Whatever Ba says goes.

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,880
Take good care of her.

194
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
How do I protect her?

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Protect her.

196
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,040
It has a folk song vibe.

197
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,960
Yes, it's from the Northeast.

198
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,960
That's right.

199
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,400
I came back today to settle the score with you.

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,680
Didn't you see how stylishly I'm dressed?

201
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm that person.

202
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,760
You.

203
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Friend.

204
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,560
For example, if you stuff a few in here.

205
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
He can't move now.

206
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
At this moment, he just rolled down.

207
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
I don't think it can be blocked.

208
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,400
I got it.

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
It's this person.

210
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
When he was tied up inside.

211
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
He was stuck with strong glue.

212
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,880
So he couldn't move.

213
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,160
Yes.

214
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,360
It was done in advance.

215
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll take this.

216
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,000
He's always had this.

217
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
And then take this thing.

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
After the time is up.

219
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,560
Okay, no problem.

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,960
This is the most reasonable explanation so far.

221
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,560
My name is Keban Chushen.

222
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,040
I was the Star of Performing Arts in 2023.

223
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,120
Alright, Keban Chushen.

224
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Formally trained.

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
Trained.

226
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,360
Training.

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,160
I enrolled in 2020.

228
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
In 2023,

229
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,400
the two of us happily got together.

230
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,840
But I love him very, very much.

231
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,360
Because he’s not just a crush for me.

232
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
He is my love.

233
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Until one day,

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
I saw her

235
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
phone.

236
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,520
After that, he wanted to break up with me.

237
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Right in front of me,

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,440
he confessed to another woman.

239
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,560
Someone else gave a whole box.

240
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,080
He only gave you one pair.

241
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,040
Kewu Ku, I didn’t expect you to be this kind of person.

242
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,040
To be honest,

243
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,520
today is also my first time

244
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
This is the reason we broke up.

245
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Why did you look at my phone?

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
That was indeed my fault.

247
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
There are keys stuck in all of these.

248
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,400
Does anyone here have experience breaking down doors?

249
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
Come on.

250
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,880
Pretend you’re a corpse.

251
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,600
Experience the process.

252
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,280
That’s pretty much how it feels.

253
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
I think your logic is too weak.

254
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,480
Today, among the three of you,

255
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,120
I have to pick one person.

256
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,440
How do I know

257
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
what if I pick someone really stupid?

258
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,440
Would I be at fault or not?

259
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,280
If

260
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
would I still not be considered a murderer?

261
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,960
This is a legal issue

262
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,920
and also a moral issue.
