1
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,380
Hold the family-calling ceremony

2
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,940
Come find me quickly

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,540
Great-grandfather is missing

4
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,620
Great-grandfather went inside

5
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,460
It's actually 2025 now

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,100
We were invited to play roles

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,540
The two of us are ourselves

8
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,660
You two are from 1925

9
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,660
He found out I faked my death for insurance

10
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,940
I've been protecting you all along

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,860
The one who killed my father

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,900
Great-grandfather is going to hurt others

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Why does great-grandfather care so much about the treasure?

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,260
Dad

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,180
Come out and play with me

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,020
Your shining moment

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,100
Where should I go?

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,500
That room over there

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,540
There's a room over there

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,220
Let's go

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,420
Husband, you must bring her back

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,980
Close the door quickly

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,460
I'm coming, darling

24
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,900
He's not afraid

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,140
How could he not be afraid?

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,780
He's scared

27
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,260
Dad

28
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,020
Come ride the kiddie ride

29
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,180
There's someone else over there

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,980
What is this?

31
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,260
He's still pretending not to be scared.

32
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,460
Dad, this is so much fun.

33
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Bye, Dad. Let's play again next time.

34
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,820
Don't run.

35
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,220
He's back.

36
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,700
That place is really scary.

37
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
Are you serious?

38
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,380
There's a coffin.

39
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,500
Mom.

40
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,300
Mom, come find me!

41
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,300
Only you can come alone.

42
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,380
You need to take the lead now.

43
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,420
This time, it's all about a mother's love.

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,580
I really can't do it.

45
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,340
I'm already soaked all over.

46
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,620
When she just called for her mom,

47
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,940
When you asked me about this just now,

48
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,620
You asked if I'd be scared.

49
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,300
Of course I'd be scared.

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,780
But it's okay to do this.

51
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,540
Then you go.

52
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,860
You be her "dad-mom," okay?

53
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,860
I'm scared.

54
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:20,900
How about this:

55
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,100
We'll go with her to that place.

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,500
Then let her go in by herself.

57
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
We'll wait for her at the door.

58
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,700
Right.

59
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,060
Is that okay?

60
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,380
Alright?

61
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,580
Okay.

62
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:25,900
Sure.

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,020
Let's go.

64
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,900
Come on, Mom, come here.

65
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,460
Come.

66
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,580
Where's Lao Bai?

67
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,860
Go, keep moving forward.

68
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,420
It's too dark.

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,260
It's too dark.

70
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,860
It's so scary.

71
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,380
Don't tell me it's just the two of us who came out.

72
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,460
Wait a moment.

73
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,820
Is there anyone else? Are there others around?

74
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,580
I'm here.

75
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm here.

76
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,860
He Ren is actually quite honest.

77
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,300
He definitely wouldn't mess with us.

78
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,780
Wait for me.

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,780
Or maybe you guys...

80
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,740
Or maybe you two, as a couple, should go.

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,940
It seems like there's no one behind us.

82
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,220
People behind us have caught up.

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
They've caught up, it's fine.

84
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,100
Follow to where?

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Did you hear the sound inside?

86
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
I really don't dare to go.

87
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,900
This is a bit too scary.

88
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,020
Let's try it first.

89
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,580
You've already gotten used to it, I think it's fine.

90
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,620
We're all here, what are you afraid of?

91
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,980
We'll keep the door open for you.

92
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,900
We'll wait for you at the door.

93
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,300
You need to push your limits.

94
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,140
Life is full of obstacles, right?

95
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,060
It's okay, you can do it.

96
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,860
We'll wait for you at the door.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,980
We're all here.

98
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
We're all here.

99
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,940
We're all here.

100
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,900
We're all here.

101
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,340
It's okay.

102
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,300
It's open.

103
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,540
It's fine.

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:00,820
It's okay.

105
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,260
It's empty inside.

106
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,900
It's fine.

107
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,540
It's empty, I saw it.

108
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,220
I saw everything.

109
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,700
Can't you go with me?

110
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,340
You try it by yourself first.

111
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,660
And as soon as you turn around, we'll be right there.

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,900
Hurry, help me tie the doll's hair.

113
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,100
Where's the doll?

114
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
The doll is on the floor.

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,980
But I don't dare open my eyes.

116
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,580
I really can't do it.

117
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,660
How about we do this instead?

118
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,620
Let's send a guardian.

119
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,700
Have the guardian protect mom as she goes over.

120
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,780
Come on, "boy mom," hurry.

121
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,420
Come on.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,540
Brother's coming.

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Come on, "boy mom."

124
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,900
Okay, come on.

125
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,940
Okay.

126
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:58,820
Okay.

127
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,260
What was that sound?

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,620
What sound?

129
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,380
It's a sound coming from you.

130
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,020
It's this bead on me.

131
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,860
It's the sound of the bead I'm wearing.

132
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,740
I can't see anything at all.

133
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,980
What's wrong?

134
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,900
Here.

135
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,060
I really can't take it anymore.

136
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm really about to faint.

137
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,460
It's okay.

138
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,980
Why are you fainting, my sister?

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,860
It's okay.

140
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,740
There's a cold wind blowing underneath.

141
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,140
Are your eyes open now?

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,700
They're open.

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,660
Can you see anything?

144
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,620
No, I can't see anything at all.

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,500
But I still don't dare to open them.

146
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,020
I see it.

147
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,740
Where is it?

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,460
No, I saw a red light.

149
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,980
What's scary about a red light?

150
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
I'm not scared.

151
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,740
It's a rocking horse.

152
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,060
This is the rocking horse the child sat on.

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,700
Okay.

154
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,780
But where's the hair?

155
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,580
Found it.

156
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,380
I touched it.

157
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,340
You brush its hair.

158
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,020
How do I brush it? Don't let go of me yet.

159
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,860
I won't.

160
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,340
Mom, sit down quickly.

161
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
Where should I sit?

162
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,700
Sit in front of the mirror.

163
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Listen to what it's saying.

164
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:22,660
It's what you want.

165
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,300
You just need to close your eyes.

166
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,860
Okay, I haven't opened my eyes at all.

167
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Okay.

168
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,420
Okay.

169
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,300
Wait a moment.

170
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,340
Put your hand on my shoulder.

171
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm not leaving.

172
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,260
Alright.

173
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,900
Okay, then what?

174
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,620
You really, you really sweated a lot.

175
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
Okay.

176
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,460
Alright.

177
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,060
This is your daughter. Take a look.

178
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,580
I won't look.

179
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,900
Just look, hurry, take a look.

180
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,380
I won't look.

181
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,540
Okay, fine, it's alright.

182
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,140
It's done.

183
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,260
It's over.

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,260
You're not my mom.

185
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,980
Go away, I want my mom.

186
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,980
She's not her mom.

187
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,620
Then who is her mom?

188
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,220
It can't be me, right?

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,020
No, she said she's not her mom.

190
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,900
There are no other women.

191
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,380
She felt like someone dragged her away.

192
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,580
She kept holding onto a pillar.

193
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,340
I really can't do it. I can't go in.

194
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,100
What did you just say?

195
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,060
You said it's your turn to go in.

196
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,380
Yeah.

197
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,900
When it's your turn, didn't you say you're fine?

198
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,540
Above the moon.

199
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,900
Would you dare to go in alone?

200
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,900
If I really have to go, I will.

201
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,140
It's easy to talk when you're not the one doing it.

202
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,300
Okay, it's open.

203
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,700
Alright.

204
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Okay.

205
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,940
It's done.

206
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,820
This month.

207
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,860
Where is it?

208
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,140
It's here.

209
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,980
This girl is for you.

210
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
You're so bad.

211
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,900
Jingou Baio, you've gotten naughty now.

212
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,500
Let me tell you.

213
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,100
No, I want to give this child to her.

214
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,460
She just said something.

215
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,700
You're not my mom.

216
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,420
We all heard it.

217
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,020
Yeah.

218
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,820
So,

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,060
Mom.

220
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Maybe the next woman is her mom.

221
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,220
It's not maybe, it's definitely.

222
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,780
It definitely is.

223
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,580
That's definitely the case.

224
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,620
Mom.

225
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,780
Fu He.

226
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,020
Do you have another girlfriend outside?

227
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,020
I don't.

228
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,380
Mom, come find me quickly.

229
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,260
Mom.

230
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,380
I'm begging you.

231
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
My heart is about to jump out.

232
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,300
Can you do it yourself? You say first.

233
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,940
I don't dare.

234
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,260
Come on.

235
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,180
It's fine, Yue, let him go with you.

236
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,660
Let our bravest little brother...

237
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,420
Shouldn't the doll be given to us?

238
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,940
Yeah.

239
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,220
Alright, it's fine.

240
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,500
Yeah.

241
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,180
It's okay.

242
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,740
Come, I'll go in front.

243
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,820
It's okay, come on.

244
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,940
Hurry up and dress my doll.

245
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,220
Okay, where are the clothes?

246
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,180
The clothes.

247
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,100
You guys look for the clothes on the floor.

248
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,780
They're on the floor, right?

249
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,860
The clothes should be in that coffin.

250
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,620
In the coffin?

251
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,900
Don't talk nonsense.

252
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,980
Don't listen to his nonsense.

253
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,060
Can you walk in front?

254
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,980
There's a jar over here.

255
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,460
We need to walk around this.

256
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
Squat down.

257
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,220
Get down.

258
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,940
You step.

259
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,380
Wait, you're stepping on me.

260
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm not.

261
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,620
This is...

262
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,740
What's over here?

263
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,020
See if you can put this on.

264
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,540
The doll fell.

265
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,380
What?

266
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,140
It dropped something.

267
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,220
It should be the clothes that fell.

268
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,180
No, it dropped a wig.

269
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,460
No.

270
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,580
I feel hair all over the floor.

271
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,260
I feel hair all over the floor.

272
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,460
Really?

273
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,100
Yeah.

274
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,700
I found it.

275
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,460
Dress the doll.

276
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,020
Okay.

277
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,940
Don't scare me, kid.

278
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,380
I'm here.

279
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,820
That's so scary.

280
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,660
You're not her mother.

281
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,100
So that means

282
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,180
it's true that she's your girlfriend.

283
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,700
How is that possible?

284
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,060
I was pregnant for ten months, did you forget?

285
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,460
Only you are fake.

286
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,620
So you were fake all along.

287
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,540
Only you are fake.

288
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,260
But what about my tattoo?

289
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,460
That can be faked.

290
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,580
How is that possible?

291
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,820
My tattoo is real.

292
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,300
No, the idea is

293
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,420
the two of us both woke up with amnesia.

294
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:38,620
Right.

295
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,300
Our identities

296
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
were all told to you by Great-grandpa.

297
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,140
Right.

298
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,620
Isn't that right?

299
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,860
It's possible that it's all fake.

300
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,380
But am I real?

301
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,980
Didn't she say she also lost her memory?

302
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,740
Did you forget?

303
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,060
Right.

304
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,300
It's possible someone was switched, right?

305
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,780
It's on.

306
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,980
This is a dress.

307
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,580
You're not my mother either.

308
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm not her mother either.

309
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,220
It's okay.

310
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,820
I'm not either.

311
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,620
What's wrong?

312
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,900
Do we still have someone here pretending to be a man?

313
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,580
Only one person hasn't gone in.

314
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,180
So, the four of us men

315
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,900
should find a room later to check each other.

316
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,620
Let's see who is actually a woman.

317
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
Isn't it obvious? Isn't it him?

318
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,980
He already, in the last episode,

319
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,500
admitted it.

320
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,700
Alright, Miss Bai.

321
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,180
That's right.

322
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,140
"Two Butterflies" is her mother.

323
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,300
Let's split up.

324
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,780
You must come find me.

325
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,460
Okay.

326
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
When the time comes,

327
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,540
I'll come find you singing "Two Butterflies."

328
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,980
He might be a heartbreaker.

329
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,780
Because he fell for a new girl.

330
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,460
"Two Butterflies" is her mother.

331
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,340
Yeah, that's possible.

332
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,380
Okay.

333
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
No way.

334
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,780
Alright, I'll go in front.

335
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,260
Okay.

336
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,500
You can hold onto me.

337
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,140
Okay.

338
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,340
You're not either, so why is that?

339
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,100
I'm not either.

340
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,060
Fu He.

341
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,780
How many girlfriends have you actually had?

342
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,940
Dad, uncles, and aunties,

343
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,060
all of you come.

344
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,740
We still need to go.

345
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
But this time, let's go together.

346
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,580
Let's go, together.

347
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,540
Let's go.

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,420
I just came out.

349
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,500
Then I'll bring up the rear, let's go.

350
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,940
Is it?

351
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,940
Where are you going?

352
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm going over to the dressing table now.

353
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,020
Have you seen my mom?

354
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,540
No.

355
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,460
Don't even mention them.

356
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,420
Even I don't know.

357
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,020
Wait, what's that?

358
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,060
If I go any further, there's nothing.

359
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,300
Dad.

360
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,140
This place is so strange.

361
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,460
The people here have no faces.

362
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,780
They're not standing in the right places.

363
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,460
It's not like in the painting.

364
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,500
You guys,

365
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,060
draw faces on them like in the painting.

366
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,500
You have to draw faces.

367
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,820
But whatever you do, don't draw eyes.

368
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,660
I'm going to find Mom now. Goodbye.

369
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,460
None of the people here have faces.

370
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,220
They're not standing in the right positions either.

371
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,300
We just need to take these mannequins

372
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,900
and arrange them like in the painting.

373
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Then we draw faces on them.

374
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,620
Where do we draw them?

375
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,260
Right here.

376
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,460
Whose wedding is this?

377
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,620
This is Great-grandpa.

378
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
It does look a bit like Great-grandpa.

379
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,020
Yeah.

380
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,900
Should we put this person

381
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,780
in this spot according to the painting?

382
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,140
Because the colors match.

383
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,460
Right.

384
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,620
Yeah.

385
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,700
So who will be the bride?

386
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,540
The bride is over there.

387
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,380
What about the groom?

388
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,620
He'll be the groom.

389
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,219
Let him stand here.

390
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,219
What? I have to stand here as the groom?

391
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,340
You're the one dressed most like him.

392
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,180
Give it a try.

393
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Here's the paintbrush.

394
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,620
Let's start drawing.

395
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,260
Okay.

396
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,940
Put them in the right spots.

397
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,500
The purple one goes here.

398
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,780
What about the blue one?

399
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,900
Does it go here?

400
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm missing a woman in the middle.

401
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,700
That's right.

402
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,420
Come on.

403
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,820
Okay, the third one.

404
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,180
And then black lips.

405
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Black lips, thin eyebrows.

406
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,740
Okay, it's done.

407
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,620
Let's take a look together first.

408
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,460
See if anything happens.

409
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,180
What will happen?

410
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,340
It's getting a bit cold.

411
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,660
I've got goosebumps.

412
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,260
It's fine.

413
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,420
Could it be a secret passage?

414
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,500
It's possible.

415
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,780
Seatbelt.

416
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,420
It's your turn to go.

417
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,380
This is a conveyor belt.

418
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,860
Lie down and it'll take you somewhere else.

419
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,700
Lie down.

420
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,700
Lie down.

421
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,380
Right, two people at a time.

422
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,700
Everyone has to go.

423
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,620
Everyone has to go.

424
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,940
One at a time.

425
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,780
It's fine like this.

426
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,580
Let those two try it first.

427
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,060
You two girls.

428
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,820
We'll go last.

429
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,660
Okay.

430
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,900
You two go first.

431
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,220
Alright.

432
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,980
It's fine.

433
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,660
This one's safe.

434
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,980
This kind of machine is safe.

435
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,420
Wait, isn't this a bit scary?

436
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,460
Goodbye.

437
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,220
Hopefully it doesn't flip over.

438
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,260
Be careful.

439
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,180
Safe.

440
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,540
I'm a bit dizzy.

441
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,260
I can't, I'm closing my eyes.

442
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,500
That was awesome.

443
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,180
This round,

444
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,780
Let's not talk.

445
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,260
Is anyone there?

446
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,940
In a bit, you two girls can go.

447
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,700
Okay.

448
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,020
Alright.

449
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,300
But there's a problem.

450
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,580
It might be dark over there.

451
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,460
What's wrong?

452
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,420
Lie down with me for a bit.

453
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
It probably won't be.

454
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,380
They'll meet you over there.

455
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,860
It's fine.

456
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,260
It's fine.

457
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
They'll meet you.

458
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,860
They will.

459
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,340
You have to trust us.

460
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
How about we go first?

461
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,300
You two cover the rear.

462
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,180
No way.

463
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,060
We will definitely meet them.

464
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,460
Right?

465
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:33,980
Yeah.

466
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,420
Why are you so bad now?

467
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
He Ren is still pretty honest.

468
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,460
I'm telling the truth.

469
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,620
No, we're for real.

470
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,580
It's safe here.

471
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,620
Over there is unknown.

472
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,100
That's the problem now.

473
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,700
Yeah.

474
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,180
Above the moon, do you trust us?

475
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,260
Why should I trust you?

476
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,860
I don't even know how many girlfriends you have.

477
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,300
I'm telling you, look, it's dark over there.

478
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,660
The main thing is, we're worried about that side now.

479
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,380
Okay.

480
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll trust you this time. Don't mess with me.

481
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,500
Who came in with you just now? Did you forget?

482
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,140
Come on.

483
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,780
But there's a possibility.

484
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,260
If the two of us leave, this light will turn off.

485
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,300
You come out.

486
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,380
Wait a second.

487
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,180
Are you sure?

488
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,460
I'll go cause trouble in your livestream.

489
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,780
Don't mess around. Wait for me there, do you hear?

490
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,580
Okay, don't worry.

491
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,620
You two wait here and behave.

492
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,940
Okay.

493
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,780
This is the last time I trust a man.

494
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,780
Help!

495
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,660
There's something here.

496
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,620
Seriously?

497
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,660
Wait.

498
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,540
Don't touch me.

499
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,700
I really want to go home.

500
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,940
I really want to go home.

501
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,020
If we go over there, will we...

502
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,860
Are they trying to scare us?

503
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
They're hiding there and not moving.

504
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,420
It stood up.

505
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,420
It's over.

506
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,820
It's not on.

507
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,580
A hair fell down.

508
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,900
Cooperate, just cooperate a bit.

509
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,420
It's over. What about those two?

510
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,180
Breaking up for good.

511
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,420
Can this door be opened?

512
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,380
They installed it.

513
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,020
Impossible.

514
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Who could make a sound like that?

515
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,540
No one.

516
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,380
What about Butler Ke?

517
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,900
No.

518
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,500
No.

519
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,140
Wait a second.

520
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,820
Wait, something's not right.

521
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,860
Yue, this feels a bit off.

522
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,740
Here's what I think.

523
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,020
I've truly done good deeds for many years.

524
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,140
I've never done anything bad.

525
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,700
Me too.

526
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,380
Never done anything bad.

527
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,140
Not even a little.

528
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,860
Not at all.

529
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,820
A clear conscience fears no shadow.

530
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,660
A clear conscience fears no shadow.

531
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,140
Really.

532
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,860
My conscience is clear.

533
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,500
No guilt at all.

534
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,540
So hard, so scary.

535
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,260
Don't you think the two of us wearing these clothes

536
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,780
and lying here

537
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,300
is really

538
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,820
quite scary?

539
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,380
It's scary.

540
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,980
Stop it.

541
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,740
Wait.

542
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,580
I'm really timid.

543
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,660
Don't forget, we've never done anything to feel guilty about.

544
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,540
Never done anything wrong.

545
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,140
Really, never, truly.

546
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,300
Really, it's fine.

547
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,540
Afraid

548
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:39,780
Should I unbuckle my seatbelt?

549
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,620
Ning

550
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,700
He

551
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,820
Here they come

552
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,980
I don't know her

553
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,420
Why did he lock me up with a dead person?

554
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,620
She left

555
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,500
She left

556
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,340
She left

557
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,700
She left

558
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,780
We're in front of you

559
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,140
Don't be afraid

560
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,940
Is the door open?

561
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,540
Is the door open?

562
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,220
I think my throat can't take it anymore

563
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,460
That was terrifying

564
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,020
Where?

565
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,700
We're here

566
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,460
Come

567
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,500
Come, I'll help you down

568
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Where was she just now?

569
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,700
Right in front of you

570
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,420
Who made me go last?

571
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,380
We just had that too

572
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,340
Yeah, the same thing

573
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,780
Right

574
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,380
Go this way

575
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,740
Let's go

576
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,220
Go that way, that way

577
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,860
This way

578
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,300
Me

579
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,100
The door is closed

580
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,540
I closed the door

581
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:33,940
Great

582
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,060
Wait, there's something here

583
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,420
Close your eyes

584
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,020
They're closed

585
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
The light is on

586
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,460
Okay

587
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,820
Tuita Ye

588
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,780
Does anyone know the person next to him?

589
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,700
Is it possible

590
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
that he wants to bring his wife back to life?

591
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,540
It's possible.

592
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,980
Come back to life, my love.

593
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,540
So isn't this a clue? Take a look.

594
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,460
There must be something underneath.

595
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,780
Found Tuita Ye's phone.

596
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,980
Take a look.

597
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,060
Wait, let me read this first.

598
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,700
You read it first.

599
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,460
He has an annual

600
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,020
folk parade in Tuitu Village.

601
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,500
He secretly saw that She is planning something big at the event.

602
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,980
At that time, the whole Tuitu Village will be dragged down.

603
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,900
Tell Ke to be ready to cover my escape.

604
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,780
Tell Ke...

605
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,500
Butler Ke.

606
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,100
Right.

607
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,660
Tell No. 9 that something big is happening, and to be on standby.

608
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,940
So this is...

609
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,220
This is Tuita Ye's note.

610
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,780
He saw She.

611
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,180
He's planning something big at the event.

612
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,780
Actually, he was set up by someone too.

613
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,500
Tuita Ye

614
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,100
is also working for someone else.

615
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,460
Yes.

616
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,660
Take a look at this phone.

617
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,700
There are two people in the messages.

618
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
One is Li Yuebang.

619
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,420
And the old man?

620
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,300
He came to find him.

621
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,060
Your heart rate monitor

622
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,740
Why does it show your heart has stopped?

623
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,500
Are you okay?

624
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,100
It was today.

625
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
At 12:26 p.m.

626
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,860
When we were playing the game.

627
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,460
Right.

628
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,100
Then She sent him a message.

629
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,540
Miss you, wild one.

630
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,020
I want to discuss a long-term partnership with you.

631
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,820
What kind of partnership?

632
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,780
Starting at the end of this month,

633
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
I will send you

634
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,220
six corpses every month.

635
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,700
The contact is Ning Dengpao from Tuitian Food Factory.

636
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,140
You just need to keep them in cold storage for me long-term.

637
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,060
And keep it strictly confidential.

638
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,020
Of course, every month

639
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,180
I will also pay you a fixed amount.

640
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,660
A fixed payment of 300,000.

641
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,180
And in this photo album

642
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,660
there is a screenshot of an account.

643
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,260
An Shi Nendie.

644
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,300
Isn't An Shi Nendie you?

645
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,660
But why would he save this?

646
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,260
Yes.

647
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
So, there's a video.

648
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,620
Let's watch the video.

649
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,340
Watch the video.

650
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,780
Tui City News

651
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,460
February 26, 2025

652
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,380
An explosion occurred at Tui Sweet Food Factory.

653
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,460
On the surface, the factory was a candy factory.

654
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,940
But secretly, it was involved in

655
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,180
illegal dark web live streams.

656
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,660
The factory electrician, Ning Dengpao,

657
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,940
was actually the founder of the dark web.

658
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,900
The mastermind behind it all.

659
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,140
September 2024

660
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,460
to January 2025

661
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,660
Ning Dengpao held one

662
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
killing livestream every month.

663
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,180
After Ning Dengpao's crimes were exposed,

664
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,620
Is Ning Dengpao even human?

665
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,660
Tui Sweet Food Factory immediately exploded.

666
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,220
The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

667
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,220
Worse than an animal.

668
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,700
Ning Dengpao is truly worse than an animal.

669
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
I think so too.

670
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,660
How should I put it...

671
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,340
I... I saw this news before.

672
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,180
This news isn't just about Ning Dengpao.

673
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,420
There's also someone named He Niba.

674
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,700
And someone called Jin Tangshao.

675
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,340
And another one named Ke Anbao.

676
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,140
Ke Ankan.

677
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,780
There's also someone named Ba Fentang.

678
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,820
And someone called Bai Hanzhi.

679
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,180
He killed a fan who loved him the most.

680
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,700
There's a person named He Niba.

681
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
He runs an underground casino.

682
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,100
He ruined countless families.

683
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,060
He's really a bad person.

684
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,460
But Jin Tangshao and Ba Fentang

685
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,580
sound pretty innocent.

686
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,620
That Ke Ankan

687
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
also doesn't seem to have any story.

688
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,220
Yeah, I think Jin Tangshao and Ke Ankan

689
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,220
are definitely fine.

690
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,700
That Ke Ankan just sounds silly.

691
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,740
What is Ke Ankan?

692
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,020
Ke Ankan is like this, I remember now.

693
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,540
At that time, Ke Ankan

694
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,180
Guys,

695
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,900
Let's stop looking at Ke Ankan for now, check this out instead.

696
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,580
Okay, boss.

697
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,180
Let's not look for now.

698
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,220
Yes, young master.

699
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
This is Tui Taiye's diary.

700
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,940
Date: May 2000.

701
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,380
The Good House has been abandoned for nearly a hundred years.

702
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,500
But actually, all along,

703
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,460
it's been a home for orphans like me.

704
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,100
It's like an orphanage.

705
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,060
We used a fake painting to create

706
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,980
the illusion of members of the Good family

707
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,620
coming out of the painting.

708
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,740
It made people afraid to come near.

709
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,260
Everyone is empty inside.

710
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,540
That means we came out of the painting.

711
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,180
Right?

712
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,780
Right.

713
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,020
So we could live here in peace.

714
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,300
Then it says below,

715
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,980
the things here,

716
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,380
there are some unclean things here.

717
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,820
This house

718
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,900
is unclean.

719
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,300
So they made it up themselves.

720
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,660
Yes.

721
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,660
Then, the next page.

722
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,940
February 2018.

723
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,780
This person isn't good either.

724
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,580
I also found an ice cellar.

725
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,700
Inside, there were actually

726
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,660
Good Fuhe from a hundred years ago

727
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,780
and Jinhou Baio,

728
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,300
and the corpse of Good Baobei.

729
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,740
You two really are from ancient times.

730
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,460
Yes.

731
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,540
The legend that they were sealed in the paintings is all fake.

732
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,420
I decided to use this perfect ice cellar

733
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,700
to run a business selling corpses.

734
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,740
That way, I could make more money

735
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,100
and give Xiangni a better life.

736
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,260
May 2023

737
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,980
I put her body

738
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,900
in the ice cellar.

739
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,420
This way, I could see

740
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,020
her lifelike appearance every day.

741
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,300
It was as if she was always by my side.

742
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,700
Xiangni is here.

743
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,900
Friends, still sitting here.

744
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,060
This isn't an ice cellar.

745
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,620
The one who just ran out might be

746
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,780
Yes, the crazy one.

747
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,380
That's the one.

748
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,940
Yes, we were brought back to life.

749
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,420
Then my Xiangni

750
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,700
can also be revived, right?

751
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,980
I immediately asked She.

752
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,660
He told me

753
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,020
this is a secret technique of the Good family.

754
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,380
But he could help me.

755
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,660
April 2025

756
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,300
She really brought Xiangni back to life for me.

757
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,700
But she was acting crazy.

758
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,780
She told me

759
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,300
this is a side effect of the resurrection technique.

760
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,460
But he didn't really understand

761
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,220
the Good family's secret technique either.

762
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,900
I had to find another way.

763
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,700
But we weren't crazy.

764
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,580
Just unstable.

765
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,060
We lost our memories.

766
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
Where is this?

767
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,220
Who are you?

768
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Who are we?

769
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,420
Some went mad, some lost their memories.

770
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Next.

771
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
I decided to use the Good mansion

772
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,460
to create an immersive environment

773
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,220
to recreate Jin and He

774
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,180
and the details of their lives in 1925.

775
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,099
And to replicate the family-calling ritual

776
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,460
to help the two fully recover their memories.

777
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,740
So all of this was for you two.

778
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,619
May 1, 2025

779
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:24,980
I have been closely monitoring

780
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,059
Good Fuhe and Jin Gou Baiou.

781
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,059
But they still haven't remembered.

782
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,180
The resurrection technique.

783
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,420
They even tried to escape several times.

784
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,220
If they dare do this again,

785
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,139
I'll make one of them

786
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:35,940
die again.

787
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,619
Let's see exactly how the resurrection works.

788
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,900
If the resurrection doesn't work,

789
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
we'll still have someone alive to keep observing.

790
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,020
They want to kill both of us.

791
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,660
It's not about killing you two.

792
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,340
They want us to remember the resurrection ritual.

793
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,540
Right.

794
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,020
Yeah.

795
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,020
There's something under here.

796
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,900
And there's a piece of paper.

797
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
A transaction record.

798
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,060
Adult: Gudefuhe, cause of death: hanged.

799
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,500
Died by hanging.

800
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,460
Child: Gudebaobei, died of illness.

801
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,580
That's how it is.

802
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,500
The cause of death for you two

803
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,620
was that your child died of illness,

804
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,900
and you both didn't want to live anymore,

805
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,860
so you hanged yourselves.

806
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,540
He's a body trafficker.

807
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,820
These are his purchase orders.

808
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,340
The original inventory was just three corpses.

809
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,460
So did I buy from here?

810
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
Didn't you buy from the dark web?

811
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,300
You bought a corpse, right?

812
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,620
Yeah.

813
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,500
Anshi Nendie.

814
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,660
I specifically wrote down this height characteristic.

815
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,020
Because he discovered my

816
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,140
secret, so

817
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,740
the body he gave me

818
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,740
had my profile picture when chatting with me.

819
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,260
Isn't there a photo of my profile picture on my phone?

820
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,980
Then, when he delivered the body to me,

821
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,620
he saw the person pushing the body down.

822
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,540
The person with the cart

823
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,620
was wearing a bracelet like this on his hand.

824
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,260
The same bracelet as the one on my hand.

825
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,540
Then he must have used some method

826
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,580
to find out about my faked death insurance scam.

827
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,660
He even got my bracelet.

828
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,900
I went to see Old Master Gu De.

829
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,220
I found the bracelet.

830
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
So he came to threaten me.

831
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,820
But this bracelet

832
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,860
was mistaken by Ning as the murderer's.

833
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,500
And below here

834
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,700
are all transactions for Ning's light bulbs.

835
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,620
Add six.

836
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Three hundred thousand per month.

837
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,020
This is

838
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,740
Right.

839
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
Four pre-ordered bodies have been delivered.

840
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,380
On May 7th, four bodies were delivered.

841
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,500
The delivery time for the remaining six bodies is to be determined.

842
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,540
So far, we've sorted out the earlier part.

843
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,260
It's all clear now.

844
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,740
Right.

845
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,140
The legend is fake.

846
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,540
But the resurrection ritual is real.

847
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,700
There's still one place we haven't found.

848
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,340
The ice cellar.

849
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,820
Yeah.

850
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,460
And the master's body.

851
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,780
The great master was in

852
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,340
the main hall.

853
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,260
He disappeared from the main hall.

854
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,340
So here's the thing—I just remembered.

855
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,100
Before we did the ritual,

856
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,180
I made sure all the doors were locked.

857
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,940
So that's the entrance to the secret room.

858
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,620
No, so it makes sense that

859
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,700
his body

860
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,300
might still be in the hall

861
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
where we played the game.

862
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,060
There's a hidden compartment there.

863
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,780
Step on it and there's a pit underneath or something.

864
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,580
Or maybe there's another passage.

865
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,940
Or maybe it's just right there.

866
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,260
Yeah.

867
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,980
Right.

868
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,780
Then we need to go back and take another look.

869
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,340
Let's go.

870
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,260
Yeah, as soon as we go out, it's that place from before.

871
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,700
Right.

872
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,700
Here is a

873
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,100
Coca-Cola "Enjoy Together" challenge

874
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Complete the challenge

875
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,620
and you can win Coca-Cola

876
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,420
the title of "Joy Explorer"

877
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,820
and unlimited Coca-Cola drinks

878
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,020
I'll choose this one

879
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,460
Bystander challenge

880
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,740
I saw one on today's show

881
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,500
Yeah

882
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,220
Okay, I'll do the comedian challenge

883
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,140
One is a real elephant

884
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,100
One is a fake elephant

885
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,620
How can you tell them apart?

886
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,620
You have to throw both elephants into the water

887
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,300
The real elephant will float to the surface

888
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,220
Coca-Cola sharing bottle

889
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
The bystander they're talking about is me

890
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,980
Then we have to be friends forever

891
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,740
And meal buddies

892
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,220
Coca-Cola sharing bottle

893
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,940
Now available in a variety of personalities

894
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,660
Have fun with the Coca-Cola sharing bottle

895
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,780
Let's enjoy together

896
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,220
Cheers

897
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,300
Cheers

898
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
It's so cold

899
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,820
Come in

900
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,060
It's raining outside

901
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
It's raining

902
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,580
There's a leak.

903
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,540
What's seeping out here?

904
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,180
That means this connects to the outside.

905
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,260
Because it's raining outside.

906
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,740
Right.

907
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,180
It's behind this, right?

908
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,820
Right behind this.

909
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,020
There's a hidden door here.

910
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,940
Look for a mechanism.

911
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Is it one of these circles?

912
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,500
I got it.

913
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,460
It's these things.

914
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,860
It's probably this one.

915
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,180
While we were feeling the wall,

916
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,100
we saw this.

917
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,860
Look for a mechanism.

918
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,100
Just as expected.

919
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,020
Come out.

920
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,060
Great-grandpa.

921
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,860
You're amazing.

922
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,460
Is it leaking because of the rain?

923
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:45,980
It's leaking rainwater.

924
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,700
Because it just rained.

925
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,100
Come on, everyone.

926
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Where are the gloves?

927
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,940
Get the gloves, put them on.

928
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,580
Should we drag it out?

929
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,140
Here.

930
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,620
It's done.

931
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,660
Okay, it's done.

932
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,380
He's soaked all over.

933
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,620
Yeah, because of the rain.

934
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,900
It just rained, and there's a leak.

935
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,300
A knife is stuck in his chest.

936
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,100
So that means...

937
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,340
There's nothing else, right?

938
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,060
Right.

939
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,580
Let's check the storage room again.

940
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,580
Great-grandfather

941
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,620
Everything you wanted has been put in your room.

942
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,260
There are several white porcelain bottles and several yellow porcelain bottles.

943
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,300
This is the secret formula.

944
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,820
First, sprinkle it on the painting.

945
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,540
The colorless liquid from the white porcelain bottle.

946
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,340
Then take the yellow liquid from the yellow porcelain bottle.

947
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,140
Pour it onto the same spot.

948
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,260
It will reveal what you want.

949
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,060
Some kind of effect.

950
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,020
I guess this is probably...

951
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,620
This is that painting.

952
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,140
The painting.

953
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,460
Right.

954
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,820
Yes.

955
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,140
As expected

956
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,140
Look, there's something here

957
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,900
Decision

958
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,140
Evidence

959
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,140
has appeared

960
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,660
The culprit is locked in

961
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,340
The culprit is locked in

962
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,020
Sorry

963
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,420
You did it on purpose, I knew it

964
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,460
Destroying evidence

965
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,420
The culprit is locked in

966
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,380
It's glass, sorry

967
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,900
White porcelain bottle, yellow porcelain bottle

968
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,460
That's the thing he used for painting

969
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,020
Chemical reagent

970
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,540
There's also a note inside

971
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,300
New knowledge from Tuitu Village

972
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,660
Glutinous rice paper enters the village

973
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,820
Made from cassava flour

974
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,100
It dissolves after forty-five minutes in water

975
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,580
Villagers rush to try it

976
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,820
I got it

977
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,020
What is it used for?

978
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,500
It's used for wrapping things

979
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,700
Wrap what?

980
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,100
Wrap the three little figurines that Ning has

981
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,860
You already know the answer and are just forcing it to fit, right?

982
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,460
That's how he is, he works backwards.

983
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,940
Let me tell you,

984
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,900
you really haven't been acting smart today.

985
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,460
I'm telling you, you'll understand in the end.

986
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,020
Who is actually smart and who isn't.

987
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,220
When you finish recording,

988
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,660
at the moment the culprit is revealed,

989
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,260
it won't matter.

990
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,740
I'm just enjoying myself right now, that's enough.

991
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,820
Really living in the moment.

992
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,620
I'm just having a great time right now.

993
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,460
Wait, what is this thing?

994
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,660
No idea.

995
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,860
Rice paper.

996
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
The one on candied hawthorn sticks.

997
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah, this thing.

998
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,340
This is rice paper.

999
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,220
You just put anything in your mouth.

1000
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,900
What's this?

1001
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,860
Great-grandpa went in.

1002
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,140
That little paper pattern

1003
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,780
Is it the same as the one on the painting?

1004
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,500
Yes.

1005
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,460
Is there anything on this?

1006
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,340
Why is there water here?

1007
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,700
This seems to be glutinous rice paper.

1008
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,860
First, sprinkle it on the painting.

1009
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,580
The colorless liquid from the white porcelain bottle.

1010
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,380
Then the yellow liquid from the yellow porcelain bottle.

1011
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,140
Pour it onto the same spot.

1012
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,300
It will reveal what you want.

1013
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,460
The glutinous rice paper enters the village.

1014
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,860
It dissolves after being in water for three quarters of an hour.

1015
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,300
It's used for wrapping things.

1016
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,180
I understand now.

1017
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,740
The culprit poured the colorless liquid from the white porcelain bottle in advance

1018
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,660
and sprinkled it on the painting.

1019
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,820
Then used glutinous rice paper to cover the gaps in the frame.

1020
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,940
After that, poured the liquid from the yellow porcelain bottle into the frame.

1021
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,660
Then waited for the summoning ceremony to begin.

1022
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,780
Walked to the edge of the painting.

1023
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Unveiled the little paper to reveal the old master.

1024
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,860
When the lights were turned on,

1025
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,740
about three quarters of an hour had probably passed.

1026
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,580
The liquid in the frame dripped onto the painting.

1027
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,780
Everyone saw blood start to appear on the painting.

1028
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,860
The old master went in.

1029
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,140
Why did he do that?

1030
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,140
To create a magical effect.

1031
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,180
To make everyone believe the old master entered the painting.

1032
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,260
Now the only question is

1033
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,540
who made this device

1034
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,380
and how the old master got inside.

1035
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,140
Come take a look at this.

1036
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Detective, check this out.

1037
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,900
The secret door to the collection room is right in the corner.

1038
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,340
I opened the secret door switch in advance.

1039
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,420
And waited inside the collection room.

1040
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,620
He would follow the path and walk in.

1041
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,740
When he walked in by himself,

1042
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,660
I killed him silently.

1043
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,820
Got it.

1044
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,340
As soon as the lights went out, he felt his way over there.

1045
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,420
He wanted to tap this person on the shoulder.

1046
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,420
But as he kept feeling around, he ended up inside.

1047
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,380
Then he was killed right inside.

1048
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,100
Once the door closed, that was it.

1049
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,380
When I walked over,

1050
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,140
he had already gone in and been killed.

1051
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,700
The killer could only be in that spot,

1052
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,700
or that spot,

1053
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,260
or maybe even this spot.

1054
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,820
So basically, that doesn't narrow it down.

1055
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,300
Only I have no suspicion now.

1056
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,540
Right?

1057
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,700
Isn't that how it works?

1058
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,580
Actually, anyone could have come over in turn.

1059
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,340
Anyone could be the killer.

1060
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,460
No, that's absolutely not possible.

1061
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,700
Let's try it out.

1062
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,300
Reenact it.

1063
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:22,700
Let's reenact it.

1064
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,820
Just reenact it and that's it.

1065
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,580
I'll play the old master.

1066
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,260
You go first.

1067
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:36,860
I'm going.

1068
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,820
Go.

1069
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,900
At this point, it shouldn't be open yet.

1070
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,620
You're the old master.

1071
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,180
Yes, I'm the old master.

1072
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,900
Tap.

1073
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I feel like you have to walk all the way here.

1074
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,700
Otherwise, how would the old master end up going inside?

1075
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,180
Impossible.

1076
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,140
He—I've walked to here.

1077
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,220
The main thing is, I've already unscrewed this.

1078
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,740
Right.

1079
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,180
No.

1080
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,260
It's not like that.

1081
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,500
I was just making it up.

1082
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,020
It definitely wasn't the first time someone walked past.

1083
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,740
And got killed right away.

1084
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,140
Yes.

1085
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,620
Because we circled around for a long time.

1086
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,580
Because I didn't know you all circled around for a long time.

1087
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,580
Let's try again.

1088
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,300
I'm going.

1089
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,460
Go.

1090
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,180
The first round is always normal.

1091
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,860
The first round is definitely normal.

1092
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,820
I'll tag her first.

1093
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,980
Go, let's start.

1094
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,220
I'll stand here, okay?

1095
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,620
Tag me, I'll go.

1096
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,620
Go.

1097
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,420
Everyone has a chance to get there.

1098
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,580
Open the door.

1099
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,340
Okay, I'm going.

1100
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,340
I'm going.

1101
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,900
I really did tag Grandpa too.

1102
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,460
Right.

1103
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:25,940
Tagged.

1104
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,780
Grandpa left.

1105
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,420
I'm going again.

1106
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,300
If I want to open the door

1107
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,660
If I'm the one opening the door

1108
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,180
You can't, you can't open it right now

1109
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,540
If you open it, he'll go over

1110
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,740
Right, so I can't open the door this round

1111
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,380
Right?

1112
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,980
Move again

1113
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,380
Move again

1114
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,980
He needs a few more rounds

1115
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,420
I know

1116
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:44,860
Okay

1117
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,700
Then I move

1118
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,180
That's not right

1119
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,820
It's the same, the logic is the same now

1120
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,500
Then only the people in front and behind

1121
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,260
Alright, then I'm the killer

1122
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,340
I'll try the white position first

1123
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,260
I'm the great-grandfather

1124
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,300
The great-grandfather has moved

1125
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,620
Move

1126
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,140
Great-grandpa leaves.

1127
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,660
When he tags you,

1128
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,660
he can actually eliminate you.

1129
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,460
Eliminate you, open the door.

1130
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,780
Push the door, throw you in, close the door.

1131
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,620
All in one go.

1132
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,020
No.

1133
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,940
So what you mean now is,

1134
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,740
I eliminate him now,

1135
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,740
open the door, throw him in, and keep moving forward.

1136
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,540
But on paper, he was already inside beforehand.

1137
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,780
Waiting for me to go in.

1138
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,780
Okay.

1139
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,860
Alright, then I’ll rule that out.

1140
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,060
I’ll rule out this method.

1141
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,380
Then you try with another person.

1142
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,660
I can’t do it either, I...

1143
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,700
No, he can.

1144
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,100
No, for example, if I were him,

1145
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,780
as soon as Great-grandpa leaves,

1146
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,100
I’d go back and tag her first.

1147
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,460
I’d let her go first.

1148
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,220
I’d let you go.

1149
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,140
Then as soon as I open the door,

1150
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,100
I wait for Great-grandpa to come in, right?

1151
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,580
The one before could work too.

1152
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,180
That works too.

1153
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,020
Let me simulate it.

1154
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,180
Okay, I’m Ke.

1155
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,100
Go.

1156
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,620
Go.

1157
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,620
Who does Yue tag?

1158
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,900
When it’s my turn, there’s no one left.

1159
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,140
That won’t work.

1160
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,620
He can’t do it.

1161
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,260
The one you can rule out is the person diagonally across.

1162
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,380
Not necessarily.

1163
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,340
For example, if I were you,

1164
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,980
Isn't Grandpa about to tag here?

1165
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,580
I rush over and tag her first.

1166
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,220
I tag her out.

1167
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,900
As soon as the door opens,

1168
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,380
I wait for him right inside the door.

1169
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,020
Right.

1170
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,100
Come on, let's try it.

1171
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,380
I'm Grandpa.

1172
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:37,940
At this moment,

1173
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,540
Let's assume

1174
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,060
this is already the N+1 round.

1175
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,740
You're getting ready to take him out this round.

1176
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,780
You rush over and tag Yue out first.

1177
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,980
Okay, I'm moving.

1178
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,060
I'm running fast.

1179
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,740
I'm leaving now.

1180
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,140
Okay.

1181
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,300
Then you go over and take him out.

1182
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,420
See, I'm moving.

1183
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,860
But that's not right.

1184
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,220
Now there's no one on Ke's side.

1185
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,020
You open the door.

1186
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,620
Open the door at this moment.

1187
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,380
I open the door, you come in.

1188
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,860
Hurry and run back.

1189
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,500
No, he needs to...

1190
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,300
I have to take you out.

1191
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,100
I have to stab you.

1192
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,100
He still has to kill someone.

1193
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,420
No, then only Yue can do it this way.

1194
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,340
Look, I'm the great-grandfather.

1195
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,420
No matter how many rounds we go,

1196
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,940
no matter how many rounds,

1197
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,660
when I move forward,

1198
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,620
the person in front of me is always Yue.

1199
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,660
That's right.

1200
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,540
Yue's position

1201
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,260
can definitely be the killer.

1202
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,020
Okay, it's locked in.

1203
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,780
Let's vote.

1204
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,340
Is there nothing else to continue for now?

1205
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,740
No, that's it.

1206
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,900
Then I'll bring up a new point.

1207
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,740
Is that okay?

1208
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,140
Let's all stand in our original positions again.

1209
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,820
Okay.

1210
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,460
After we start,

1211
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,300
let's walk half a round first.

1212
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,380
Walk half a round.

1213
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,300
Walk half a round.

1214
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,220
I'll tap him first.

1215
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,620
It's fine, go ahead.

1216
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,380
You go first.

1217
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,500
Let's play for a bit first.

1218
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,620
We need to check this first.

1219
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,260
Okay.

1220
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,900
I'm the great-grandpa.

1221
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,100
You tagged me.

1222
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,580
I'm going to tag now.

1223
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:05,900
Tagged.

1224
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,180
Tag her.

1225
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,620
What I was thinking is,

1226
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,380
we definitely need to find a chance

1227
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,540
to switch positions.

1228
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,260
We can't just play in this order.

1229
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,100
Then move again.

1230
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,100
Okay, you tagged like this, right?

1231
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,780
Yes, I tagged like this.

1232
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,180
You tagged like that, so I'll move.

1233
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,660
Switch positions during the game.

1234
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,700
We definitely have to switch.

1235
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,100
Otherwise, how can we switch if we keep doing this?

1236
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,420
The logic is all the same.

1237
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,700
We have to mix up the order first.

1238
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,500
Right.

1239
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:33,740
That's the only way.

1240
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,420
Yes.

1241
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,300
I'll move this way again.

1242
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,660
You go over there.

1243
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,980
Anyway, I'm just moving in a straight line now.

1244
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,060
We're not moving in curves.

1245
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,500
Right.

1246
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,700
I tag you.

1247
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,740
You don't have to move forward.

1248
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,820
You hide there.

1249
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,540
If he hides there, no one can tag him.

1250
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,780
You don't tag me.

1251
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,980
It's fine to wait for her to tag me.

1252
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,820
Then I have to tag her.

1253
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,860
After I leave, I won't move.

1254
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,660
Then I'll tag her again.

1255
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,500
I tag you.

1256
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,300
I won't move.

1257
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,140
Then I'll tag her again.

1258
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,220
It's fine to wait for her to tag me.

1259
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,140
I think what you said is right.

1260
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,780
As long as the culprit

1261
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,180
can find a way to switch seats,

1262
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,820
and switch to the "Moon" position, that's enough.

1263
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,060
Right.

1264
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,660
So that means everyone is possible.

1265
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,300
Yes, that's right.

1266
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,700
Yeah.

1267
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,660
No one can be ruled out.

1268
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,620
I've been ruled out.

1269
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,260
How did you

1270
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,260
How could you be ruled out, bro?

1271
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,300
I must be ruled out.

1272
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,980
Because I'm the hardest one.

1273
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,780
Because if I want to do it from my position,

1274
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,460
and go back in reverse like this,

1275
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
wouldn't I be the most complicated?

1276
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,300
You are the most—

1277
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,780
Let me tell you,

1278
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,300
I was just about to say,

1279
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,020
your simplest point is right here.

1280
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,860
For example,

1281
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,980
if you want to tag Grandpa, right?

1282
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,780
Yeah.

1283
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,540
You might tag him once,

1284
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,020
then come over here,

1285
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,580
and then tag her out.

1286
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,420
Wait for him here.

1287
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,420
You're the closest.

1288
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:00,580
Right.

1289
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,460
You can't be ruled out.

1290
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,700
I'm telling you, you can't be ruled out.

1291
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,980
How could you be ruled out?

1292
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,660
So the most crucial point now is,

1293
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,140
how many rounds did we walk?

1294
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,220
I think I got tagged six times.

1295
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,260
I think me too.

1296
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,660
Me too.

1297
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,780
Everyone was tapped six times.

1298
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,460
So, the method I just mentioned about working backwards

1299
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,380
doesn't work if we switch to the Moon's position.

1300
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,340
Because with that method, the number of times each person is tapped

1301
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,260
is different for everyone.

1302
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,580
Right?

1303
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,020
Right.

1304
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,780
So, what was our final standing position at the end?

1305
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,940
Wouldn't that make everything clear at a glance?

1306
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,620
At the end,

1307
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,780
if we can reconstruct the positions,

1308
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,580
my position at the end was like this.

1309
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,420
My final spot was here.

1310
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,500
Grandpa disappeared.

1311
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,180
Who was there at the end?

1312
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,060
Wouldn't that person be the culprit?

1313
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,380
Why?

1314
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,860
Yes, it's you.

1315
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,340
See, you finally found a place

1316
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,060
to pin it on me.

1317
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,020
After searching for so long, finally

1318
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,380
it's you.

1319
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
Fine, it's me.

1320
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,900
I understand now.

1321
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,060
So his logic is

1322
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,300
that after I did this,

1323
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,460
I killed someone inside,

1324
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,060
and as soon as I came out,

1325
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
it was already morning.

1326
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,780
Morning.

1327
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,180
Finally figured it out.

1328
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,820
Impossible.

1329
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,100
That's not right.

1330
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,940
X, don't cover for your person.

1331
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,420
What do you mean, "not right"?

1332
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,620
Then I want to ask,

1333
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,180
why was Grandpa in this position

1334
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,020
when he disappeared?

1335
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,260
Because Great-grandpa is about to disappear.

1336
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,140
And he disappears at this spot.

1337
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,380
Because Great-grandpa disappeared there.

1338
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,860
Then,

1339
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,180
So who did you take a picture of?

1340
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,900
Who did you take a picture of?

1341
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,980
When you were here, who did you photograph?

1342
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,580
If I was over there,

1343
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,900
then the one I photographed would be the culprit.

1344
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,220
That would be me.

1345
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,380
Then I should be in front of you.

1346
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,460
I should leave.

1347
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,980
No, let me think for a moment.

1348
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,060
If I come over from here,

1349
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,460
the one I photograph is...

1350
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:00,700
who?

1351
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,940
The culprit.

1352
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,500
You walk.

1353
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,060
If you are the culprit,

1354
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,260
then Great-grandpa is already gone.

1355
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,660
You pretend to be Great-grandpa, you walk.

1356
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:05,940
I'll walk.

1357
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,620
Go over and take a picture of Yue.

1358
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,300
Take a picture of Yue leaving.

1359
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,180
Yue has gone over.

1360
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,020
Then you move a bit over there.

1361
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,060
Just a little.

1362
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,060
Just a little.

1363
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,540
Then I'll leave.

1364
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:13,980
How is that possible?

1365
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,740
Go.

1366
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,060
I find that there's no one here.

1367
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,660
Then you...

1368
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,500
I'll go back again.

1369
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,260
He returns to this...

1370
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,460
correct position.

1371
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,500
Impossible.

1372
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,660
Ke, there's no one here now.

1373
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,580
You're totally framing me.

1374
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,460
I'm speechless.

1375
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,060
You can't just assume it's me.

1376
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,900
Won.

1377
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,780
Victory.

1378
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,060
Victory.

1379
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,380
I regret spending ten minutes

1380
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,380
listening to what you just said.

1381
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,260
You're such an X.

1382
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,220
You X.

1383
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,740
Don't stir things up too much, Lao Bai.

1384
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,140
Tone it down a bit.

1385
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,820
Don't stir things up too much.

1386
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,780
Don't stir things up.

1387
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,700
Disrupting the game.

1388
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,380
I'm not disrupting anything.

1389
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:51,860
I'm just...

1390
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,300
He's not disrupting anything.

1391
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,100
He's just targeting you.

1392
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,580
I'm just focusing on you.

1393
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,820
I'm not disrupting, bro.

1394
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,380
Alright, it's fine.

1395
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,140
Today, I'll make sure he knows exactly why he lost.

1396
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,380
Okay.

1397
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,100
Today, you...

1398
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:00,620
Let me tell you,

1399
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,500
if you don't vote for me,

1400
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,780
Alright.

1401
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,860
I really don't think you're a man today.

1402
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,660
Okay.

1403
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,020
Brilliant.

1404
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,820
I just love watching this kind of thing.

1405
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,940
where personal reputation is on the line.

1406
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,220
No.

1407
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,820
I don't think we can rule it out at all.

1408
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,580
Do you know why?

1409
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,020
After Great-grandpa died,

1410
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,340
you all could still play many more rounds.

1411
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,660
Let's simulate it now.

1412
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,420
Great-grandpa is already dead.

1413
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:25,900
Okay.

1414
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,660
There are only four people left on the field.

1415
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,940
I'm the killer.

1416
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,340
Look.

1417
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,220
Go.

1418
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,620
Okay.

1419
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,340
I walk back.

1420
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,100
What he said makes sense.

1421
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,220
Walk all the way back.

1422
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,860
One round passes.

1423
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,220
Tap again.

1424
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,060
At this point, isn't there no one here?

1425
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,260
I can just walk another round.

1426
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,660
I can just tap this person's shoulder.

1427
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,620
Then I walk back again.

1428
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,340
Tap him again.

1429
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,020
You can totally play many, many rounds like this.

1430
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,180
I think the killer has enough time

1431
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,460
to return to their spot.

1432
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,180
Plenty of time.

1433
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,180
If each person

1434
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,100
needs to be tapped six times,

1435
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,140
then during the whole

1436
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,700
lights-out period this morning,

1437
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,940
we walked one and a half rounds.

1438
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,140
I think it's also possible that Great-grandpa

1439
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,340
died during the first round.

1440
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,700
Anyway, he had to reach that spot

1441
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,340
to be killed.

1442
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,300
Also, I have a question.

1443
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,020
Let's not move away from this for now.

1444
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,540
But this thing,

1445
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,020
does it need to come out to draw?

1446
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,100
As long as the killer

1447
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,540
can find a way to switch seats

1448
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,420
and move to the "Moon" position,

1449
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,460
the "Moon" position can definitely be the killer.

1450
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,260
Everyone

1451
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,060
if they have to be tapped six times,

1452
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,540
this morning, when the lights were off,

1453
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,980
we walked one and a half rounds.

1454
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,420
The old master could also have

1455
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,820
died during the first round.

1456
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,460
After the old master died, you could still play several more rounds.

1457
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,820
The killer had enough time

1458
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,900
to return to their position.

1459
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,180
Let's discuss based on these clues.

1460
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,420
It's time for the heated argument segment again.

1461
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,100
The arguing has started.

1462
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,020
Motive alone can't determine the killer.

1463
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,300
We all agree on this, right?

1464
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,700
Yes.

1465
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,300
Okay, so let's rule out motive.

1466
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,340
No, a father's murder is an irreconcilable grudge.

1467
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,340
Alright.

1468
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,220
Then, the second point,

1469
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,220
I think whoever could find the old master's secret room

1470
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,580
is also very important.

1471
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,100
Right.

1472
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,860
That's correct.

1473
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,180
I think, regarding the secret room, you are the most suspicious.

1474
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,100
Because you are the butler.

1475
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,500
You are very familiar with the layout and the place here.

1476
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,540
You would know it extremely well.

1477
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,180
You might have tampered with something.

1478
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,140
And he might have been following the old master all along.

1479
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,020
Because he was always with the old master.

1480
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,340
There might be some collusion.

1481
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,540
I want to make a point.

1482
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,260
First, the premise of today's story

1483
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:43,980
is this:

1484
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,180
the few of us

1485
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,380
were invited here to play the role of the butler.

1486
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,020
I recruited those three.

1487
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,380
The four of us are in this mansion

1488
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,420
for a month.

1489
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,300
So the information we can gather

1490
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,060
is actually

1491
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,900
the same.

1492
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,340
There's another thing.

1493
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,180
We just deduced the method of the crime.

1494
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:03,900
But we

1495
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,900
do we have a consensus

1496
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,980
that this method

1497
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,460
can't rule anyone out?

1498
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,580
We agree on this, right?

1499
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,100
I think

1500
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,300
there is a way to rule someone out.

1501
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,620
We can definitely rule them out.

1502
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,620
Ruled out.

1503
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,100
You, yourself.

1504
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,420
It's you again.

1505
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,460
It's not me.

1506
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,740
Then who is it?

1507
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,460
It's him.

1508
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,300
It's Ke.

1509
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,980
I just watched it again myself.

1510
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,740
Look.

1511
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,900
Three wanted to kill One here.

1512
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,260
Come out.

1513
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,100
Then it's hard to get back to Three's position.

1514
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,460
Because Two was already heading this way.

1515
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,100
No one else could have replaced him here.

1516
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,300
So by comparison,

1517
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,420
I think he's probably the least suspicious.

1518
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,300
Makes sense.

1519
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,020
Then this method of killing

1520
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,940
can be mostly ruled out.

1521
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,340
If you all rule me out,

1522
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,780
then I can rule out one more person.

1523
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:49,860
Okay.

1524
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,580
Then we'll rule you out.

1525
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,380
I'll rule out Yue as well.

1526
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,020
I'll rule out Yue as well.

1527
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,340
That's fine.

1528
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
No problem, that's fine.

1529
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,460
Alright, you're just going to point at him anyway.

1530
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,100
I can already guess what you're going to say.

1531
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,340
I think the most crucial point right now is

1532
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,860
we haven't actually carried out

1533
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,420
the murderer's route.

1534
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:07,940
That's right.

1535
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,220
Actually, it's fine if the positions rotate.

1536
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,180
Just switch to Yue's position.

1537
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:12,820
None of them can be ruled out.

1538
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,980
So should we try it again?

1539
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,460
Of course, I think it's necessary.

1540
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,380
We don't have to walk all the way there.

1541
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,820
Let's just stay at these four corners.

1542
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,860
Let's say this spot is Grandpa.

1543
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,780
This is the secret room.

1544
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,500
This is the secret room.

1545
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,220
This is the secret room.

1546
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,140
This is the secret room.

1547
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:25,580
Okay.

1548
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,060
Look.

1549
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,380
She's beyond doubt.

1550
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,700
She had the opportunity, right?

1551
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:28,940
Right.

1552
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,540
No need to explain this.

1553
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,060
That's right.

1554
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,860
If it were you,

1555
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,780
Grandpa would walk over.

1556
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
You would have to

1557
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,100
move her out before Grandpa arrives.

1558
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,340
Then open the door.

1559
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,220
Wait for Grandpa to pass by.

1560
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,860
Then here,

1561
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,300
I wouldn't have anyone left to move.

1562
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,420
Right.

1563
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,060
He basically finished one thing in triple the time.

1564
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,500
Yes, so his suspicion is the smallest.

1565
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,100
Alright, let's work it out now.

1566
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,380
For example, if it's Ning,

1567
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,060
let's suppose it's Ning.

1568
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,540
The elder walks over.

1569
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,580
Ning goes to tag him.

1570
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,060
Then she moves on.

1571
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:58,580
Right.

1572
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,060
Tag.

1573
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,540
Gone.

1574
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,100
Wait for the elder.

1575
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,700
The elder has gone.

1576
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,620
Then you keep going.

1577
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,660
Take him out.

1578
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,220
Then, when he has time, he'll come back.

1579
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,620
No

1580
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,340
We still need one more person for this.

1581
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,740
That means,

1582
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,700
So I said, isn't this exactly the problem?

1583
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,700
After I go back,

1584
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,260
there won't be anyone left here.

1585
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,420
If there's no one here, who are you going to tag?

1586
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,780
Didn't you just realize it here?

1587
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,300
So, following this logic,

1588
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,580
Ning can't do it either.

1589
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,860
If you put it that way,

1590
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,220
then it's impossible for me too.

1591
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,500
Come on, let's try it with you.

1592
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,180
Come.

1593
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,100
I'm here.

1594
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,940
Great-grandpa leaves.

1595
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,980
Ready to go, right?

1596
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:37,860
Right?

1597
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,300
I tagged her.

1598
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:38,660
Yes.

1599
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,860
Then I come here.

1600
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,180
Open the door.

1601
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:41,820
Kill.

1602
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,020
Then,

1603
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:44,540
Okay.

1604
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,180
Then I come back.

1605
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,060
You can.

1606
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,860
Tag me.

1607
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,300
You leave.

1608
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,300
Then I pretend

1609
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,500
to go over and tag her.

1610
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,700
Then I can do it.

1611
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,540
Then I can totally do it.

1612
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,420
Then it's done.

1613
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,620
You're the most capable.

1614
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,300
That's me.

1615
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,700
You can choose when to stop.

1616
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,460
It's all up to you.

1617
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,140
So that's me.

1618
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,740
I just suddenly thought of something.

1619
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,180
It's about what we just mentioned.

1620
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,060
You can walk through it.

1621
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,380
Can you really walk through it?

1622
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,580
I have a question.

1623
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:09,940
Go ahead.

1624
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,900
You're being too idealistic.

1625
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,620
In the dark,

1626
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,180
you move diagonally through.

1627
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,820
That's the point.

1628
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,780
Who can move diagonally in the dark?

1629
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,020
Did you forget what her job is?

1630
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,460
What job do I have?

1631
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,260
She's an escape room NPC (staff).

1632
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,100
Phone.

1633
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,100
I'm from a horror escape room.

1634
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,340
A top NPC (staff).

1635
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:35,860
But her position

1636
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,620
is the one that needs to run the least.

1637
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,180
Does that have anything to do with her being an NPC (staff)?

1638
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:39,740
Right, what's the connection?

1639
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,860
There's barely any connection.

1640
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,100
If it were her,

1641
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,300
she wouldn't need to do anything.

1642
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,740
Then it would definitely be her.

1643
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,260
You know?

1644
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,620
She could do it in the first round of the game.

1645
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,420
And finish this task right away.

1646
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,420
Right?

1647
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,140
Yes.

1648
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,700
I also think it's unlikely to be her.

1649
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,420
It's too obvious.

1650
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,380
We already know the method now, right?

1651
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,860
If what we just said is correct,

1652
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,820
then let's confirm it.

1653
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,220
No problem.

1654
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,460
You can choose me.

1655
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,220
But I still insist, I would choose him.

1656
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,260
If that's the case,

1657
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,540
according to the way we just ran it,

1658
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,460
if we rule her out,

1659
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,580
then only he is left.

1660
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,340
If he is the culprit,

1661
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,180
I wouldn't have brought this up at all.

1662
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,180
Because there would be no one else.

1663
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:23,420
Do you think this is

1664
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,580
shooting oneself in the foot?

1665
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:24,980
Yes.

1666
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,100
But what if, when picking up the stone,

1667
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,740
before he throws it,

1668
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,860
he doesn't look at where he's throwing it?

1669
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,060
I think he's innocent.

1670
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,540
I vote for him.

1671
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,020
Then from my perspective, it's him.

1672
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:36,780
That means

1673
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,580
from my perspective, it's you.

1674
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,260
If from your perspective it's me, that's fine.

1675
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,940
You two are just accusing each other.

1676
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,660
You can think it over carefully.

1677
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,260
The culprit must be between the two of us.

1678
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Today's suspect is

1679
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,340
Good morning.

1680
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,220
The crime was committed by taking advantage of

1681
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,580
the family-calling ceremony

1682
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,980
and clever positioning.

1683
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,340
I voted for Good Morning.

1684
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,300
Because

1685
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,260
based on the deduction just now,

1686
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,820
Laco's window for committing the crime

1687
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,900
was clearly not enough.

1688
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,980
So I ruled him out as well.

1689
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,820
In the end, the culprit I chose is

1690
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,860
Good Morning.

1691
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,980
Among everyone who could

1692
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,140
have carried out the crime based on their movements,

1693
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,860
the easiest would be Yue,

1694
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,580
followed by Bai,

1695
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,060
and then myself.

1696
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,180
So that's why I cast my vote.

1697
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:41,940
For today's case,

1698
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,180
my choice for the real culprit is

1699
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,740
Bai Deboyi.

1700
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,780
His motive for the crime is

1701
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,260
to protect his dream lover, Jin.

1702
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,180
His method of committing the crime

1703
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,100
and the process were too obvious.

1704
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,020
So I chose him.

1705
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,740
I am Jin Gou Bai Ou.

1706
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,220
This time, I am staking all my honor

1707
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,900
and my life.

1708
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:15,740
Come on.

1709
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,100
Make your own new choice.

1710
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,660
He thinks I'm X now.

1711
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:22,300
That's right.

1712
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,380
What's the point of realizing it now?

1713
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:25,780
It's okay.

1714
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,340
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat.

1715
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,940
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden.

1716
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,060
Next, let's enter Tongcheng Travel.

1717
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,700
It's time to reveal the truth.

1718
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,820
In today's case,

1719
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,980
the suspects are

1720
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,220
Goodlako,

1721
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,260
Goodmorning,

1722
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,380
Above the Moon,

1723
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,180
White Gamble.

1724
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:46,660
Four people.

1725
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,220
After reasoning,

1726
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,580
everyone has narrowed it down to two suspects.

1727
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,620
They are

1728
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,420
Goodmorning and White Gamble.

1729
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,860
Am I really going to win?

1730
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,900
Both sides are my own flesh and blood.

1731
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,500
Lost.

1732
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:09,580
Lost.

1733
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,660
Whoever lies, I'll hit them first.

1734
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,620
Give me a weapon.

1735
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,380
Your stick.

1736
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,260
A weapon? Then I'll lend it to you.

1737
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,700
Let this wake you up today.

1738
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,780
The votes they received are

1739
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,460
I'm really a bit nervous.

1740
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:33,860
Three votes.

1741
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,260
Prime suspect.

1742
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,180
Goodmorning.

1743
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,500
Goodmorning.

1744
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,740
Prime suspect.

1745
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,020
Ning

1746
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,700
This vote went to Bai.

1747
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,380
The real suspect is

1748
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,060
Bai.

1749
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,340
Bai.

1750
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,580
Three to three.

1751
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,380
It's a tie, so the good guys win.

1752
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,540
Finally took you down.

1753
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,180
Bro.

1754
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:01,860
Just you wait.

1755
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,260
So who is the real culprit?

1756
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:06,860
So,

1757
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,420
the real culprit is

1758
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,780
I can't bear to hear it.

1759
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,700
The culprit is

1760
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:21,900
Good morning

1761
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,740
I guessed right

1762
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,380
So you are X?

1763
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,700
Today is really amazing

1764
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,780
And also a very coincidental day

1765
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,900
How so?

1766
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Today, it just so happened

1767
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,420
We had a friend come visit us, right?

1768
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,900
Yes

1769
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,060
A new friend came to visit

1770
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,820
And also

1771
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,340
You used one of your privileges, right?

1772
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:44,780
Yes

1773
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,420
The rebound card

1774
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,180
If you become X in a certain round

1775
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,820
You can bounce it to another detective

1776
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,540
If I had known it was you, I wouldn't have used it

1777
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,740
Right, so the X I chose was her

1778
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,380
She used the card

1779
01:07:59,380 --> 01:07:59,900
She used the card

1780
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,860
It's really hard for her

1781
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,700
So the chances of winning today

1782
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,780
are a bit lower

1783
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,460
But today He also played really well

1784
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,860
Great teamwork

1785
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,300
Everyone had great teamwork

1786
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,220
Great teamwork

1787
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,180
You all played really well

1788
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,700
Originally, with our culprit

1789
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,580
I wanted to put the vote on Yue

1790
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,740
Who can move diagonally in the dark?

1791
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,180
She is the secret room NPC

1792
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,620
Logically speaking,

1793
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,340
he really is the most suspicious today.

1794
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,860
No, but my attitude is the best, right?

1795
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,700
But his condition is actually really good.

1796
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,340
His attitude today is indeed very proper.

1797
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:35,700
Yes.

1798
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,340
It's a bit too proper, so I vote for him.

1799
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,940
So even if I'm proper, it's not okay?

1800
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,180
And if I'm not proper, that's not okay either.

1801
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,620
If you've been improper for too long, you can't be proper anymore.

1802
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,460
Alright.

1803
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,460
But that person over there,

1804
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,860
did a pretty good job hiding today.

1805
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,860
Hiding?

1806
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,420
I wasn't hiding.

1807
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,260
I'm a good person, what would I need to hide?

1808
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,220
She voted really well.

1809
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,700
Right.

1810
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,700
She really has that beginner's...

1811
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,260
beginner's luck.

1812
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:58,700
Intuition.

1813
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,580
It's all based on her sixth sense.

1814
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,940
In the end, when you made me choose between two people,

1815
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,780
I just thought about it for a second.

1816
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,420
Liu Yuning

1817
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:08,299
So impressive.

1818
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,339
There are two key pieces of evidence today.

1819
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:13,259
One is from

1820
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,460
the servant's report from the old master's room.

1821
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,100
It shows that Good Morning

1822
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,860
stole a painting to sell.

1823
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,500
The painting stolen had the Good Family Treasure seal.

1824
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,179
In the entire Good Family estate,

1825
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,179
only the secret collection room

1826
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:26,940
stores the Good Family Treasures.

1827
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,339
In addition,

1828
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:30,820
during the crime,

1829
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,820
the culprit used glutinous rice paper

1830
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,940
to control when the blood appeared on the painting.

1831
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,379
Everyone had a plate of snacks in their room.

1832
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,580
There was glutinous rice paper underneath.

1833
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,020
Only Good Morning's snacks

1834
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,140
didn't have glutinous rice paper.

1835
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,460
It had already been used.

1836
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,660
I didn't notice either of them.

1837
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:51,540
Come on, let's check the clues over here.

1838
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:57,379
Let's search quickly.

1839
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,219
This detail is actually quite tricky.

1840
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:08,060
It's hard to find.

1841
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,740
It's hard to spot.

1842
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:10,460
Very difficult.

1843
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,259
I missed it again.

1844
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,100
Starting tomorrow,

1845
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,420
I'll eat all the snacks.

1846
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,620
You have so much to do.

1847
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,740
You have to check your phone and eat snacks.

1848
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,900
The players who received the golden key this round are

1849
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:24,860
Golden Hook Breaks Lotus Root

1850
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,339
White Virtue Game

1851
01:10:26,339 --> 01:10:27,580
Above the Moon

1852
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,980
Thank you.

1853
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,219
Did the rankings change?

1854
01:10:33,219 --> 01:10:33,900
They changed.

1855
01:10:37,339 --> 01:10:38,620
Congratulations, baby.

1856
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,820
Thank you.

1857
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,660
You can keep your honor with this.

1858
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,180
Every time you try, you succeed.

1859
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,340
A 100% success rate.

1860
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,060
Today, we

1861
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,740
also missed a very important piece of information.

1862
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,420
Tomorrow, there will be a She event.

1863
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,300
She is holding a resurrection ceremony.

1864
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,420
There's an annual

1865
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,980
folk parade in Tuitu Village.

1866
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:03,860
Someone secretly saw She

1867
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,540
planning something big at the event.

1868
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,780
The event is on May 9th.

1869
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,460
At 5:44 in the morning.

1870
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,740
It's an immersive parade.

1871
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,740
Villagers, please dress as required.

1872
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,380
And gather at the event location.

1873
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,660
I think we can go check it out tomorrow.

1874
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,580
That early?

1875
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,460
Then I’ll have to get up at three to do my makeup.

1876
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,020
You don’t need makeup with that face.

1877
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,820
Not at all.

1878
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:24,740
Here’s the situation now.

1879
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,020
It’s already midnight.

1880
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,020
I just went to check

1881
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:29,660
everyone’s rooms.

1882
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,420
I found that

1883
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,220
the young master and young madam’s room

1884
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,100
is leaking.

1885
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,180
It’s not livable right now.

1886
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,660
But the old master’s room is fine.

1887
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,220
Then the two of us

1888
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,060
can stay in the old master’s room.

1889
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,500
No, here’s what I think.

1890
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,740
She and I are actually

1891
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,540
a couple in name only.

1892
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,300
I think we can stay separately.

1893
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,860
You two are still together for now.

1894
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,180
I'll just make do with her for one night.

1895
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,700
Right in the master's room.

1896
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:54,900
Just barely.

1897
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,940
Just for one night.

1898
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,540
I just want to spend some time with my two sons.

1899
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,140
Have a good chat and catch up.

1900
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:02,820
So tonight,

1901
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,660
I'll stay in the main hall with both of them.

1902
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,500
No, I refuse.

1903
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,260
I can't accept this for now.

1904
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,580
This relationship, right.

1905
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,740
It's fine, let him get used to it for one night.

1906
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,500
Alright.

1907
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,700
Then that's how we'll assign the rooms tonight.

1908
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,140
And gather at 5:40 a.m. tomorrow.

1909
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:19,740
Okay.

1910
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,300
Don't be late.

1911
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,180
You'll sleep well tonight.

1912
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:22,500
Let's go.

1913
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,940
Tui Taiye is rather superstitious.

1914
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,740
Because he misses his wife so much.

1915
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,820
His longing is too intense.

1916
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,700
My beloved Xiangni was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

1917
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,940
She left me.

1918
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:34,900
I placed her body

1919
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,780
in a freezer.

1920
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,380
This way, I could see

1921
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,820
her lifelike appearance every day.

1922
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,060
I think if it were his wife,

1923
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,060
she could give him

1924
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,460
some final words.

1925
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,180
I believe it would be

1926
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,620
"Please forget me

1927
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,860
and live well."

1928
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,100
Today's story revolves around

1929
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,300
the so-called "entering the painting" legend.

1930
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,260
As long as, when painting,

1931
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,460
you add human blood,

1932
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:58,140
the owner of the blood can be drawn into the painting.

1933
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,620
The phenomenon of blood seeping through the canvas seems strange,

1934
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,940
but in reality, it's just different liquids

1935
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,020
causing a chemical reaction.

1936
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,020
Many people in the story

1937
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,140
never tried to verify

1938
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,740
the truth of this legend.

1939
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,940
So first, we need to

1940
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,860
broaden our knowledge.

1941
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,020
Don't blindly believe

1942
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,660
in supernatural legends.

1943
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,900
Secondly, we should set an example ourselves

1944
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,140
and not lead others into superstition.

1945
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,780
Develop your own hobbies and interests.

1946
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,740
Breaking superstitions doesn't mean rejecting tradition.

1947
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,660
but to believe in the power of science

1948
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:27,740
and use reason to illuminate our path forward

1949
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,660
Nowadays, when many people encounter difficulties

1950
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,580
or feel confused

1951
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,180
they tend to place their hopes in fortune-telling

1952
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,100
or astrology and similar methods

1953
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,220
But in reality, in life

1954
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,060
there will always be difficult moments

1955
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,660
However, the key to solving problems

1956
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,580
is never found in the results of divination

1957
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,580
When you believe your luck is about to change

1958
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,900
you actually become proactive

1959
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,660
in seizing every opportunity

1960
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,820
Feudal superstitions

1961
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,700
definitely lack scientific basis

1962
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,060
and can lead to blind worship

1963
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,140
which actually allows many people

1964
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,580
to exploit this for their own gain

1965
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,780
I think everyone should

1966
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,540
spend more time

1967
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,300
on themselves

1968
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,660
to become better

1969
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,580
In today's fast-paced world

1970
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,540
mysticism has become a popular outlet

1971
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,420
Sometimes, a simple phrase like

1972
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,220
"Your luck is excellent today"

1973
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,620
can provide a positive psychological suggestion

1974
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,780
But these are only aids in life

1975
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,340
We must focus on rational thinking

1976
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:23,820
to face all kinds of problems

1977
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,340
and never blindly believe in feudal superstitions

1978
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,740
In our story

1979
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:30,580
he uses superstition to manipulate others

1980
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,140
According to our law

1981
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,820
this is called an indirect perpetrator

1982
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,780
Using others as a means

1983
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,260
to indirectly commit criminal acts

1984
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,740
To break superstitions

1985
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:42,060
the first step is, of course, to

1986
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,900
embrace more scientific knowledge

1987
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,460
and maintain a rational attitude

1988
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,620
If we encounter legal issues

1989
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,380
the situation becomes clearer

1990
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,740
That is to say, in our daily lives

1991
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,580
if you encounter superstitions

1992
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,260
that are used to commit crimes against you

1993
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,260
then you should bravely

1994
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,260
use legal means

1995
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,500
and protect yourself through the law

1996
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,860
and also protect others

1997
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,700
May 9th, 5:44 a.m.

1998
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,700
the annual event in Tuitu Village

1999
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,060
folk parade

2000
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:12,700
She is dead.

2001
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,460
Hurry.

2002
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,020
Commit seppuku.

2003
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,740
So he committed suicide.

2004
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,340
Everyone just watched him do it.

2005
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,060
Is murder really this boring?

2006
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:19,940
My crimes are unforgivable.

2007
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,700
I can only atone with my death.

2008
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,500
Wait a minute.

2009
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,500
The scabbard is still here.

2010
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Is it possible that...

2011
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,980
He was trying to protect some secret.

2012
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,940
He made us think it was suicide.

2013
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:29,940
Bartford.

2014
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,540
Yi Wuning.

2015
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,300
Golden Hook Breaking Lotus Root.

2016
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,940
What does that mean?

2017
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,340
Our hair.

2018
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,900
All bodies stored have their hair cut off.

2019
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,700
It's kept frozen.

2020
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,140
So I can use it later.

2021
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:38,940
That's cloning.

2022
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,180
After extracting us,

2023
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,060
we become this She person.

2024
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,300
The symbol is where the reborn's consciousness resides.

2025
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,100
That means one person.

2026
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,500
But there are two consciousnesses in the brain.

2027
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
The original memories of this body returned.

2028
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,620
Inhaling this smoke gradually erases memories.

2029
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,340
He lost his memory.

2030
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,220
So the two are fighting inside.

2031
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,620
So he used a puppet-like method

2032
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,820
to control the other person.

2033
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,460
It was a surprise attack.

2034
01:15:59,140 --> 01:15:59,860
It's getting foggy.

2035
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,140
It's getting foggy.

2036
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:01,780
What's going on?

2037
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,740
She is already dead.

2038
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,100
Yeah.

2039
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,580
Then why is all this still happening?

2040
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,260
So that means someone is still making exchanges.

2041
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,780
Didn't She die?

2042
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,060
It's also possible the real She is among us.

2043
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,060
Is someone performing the ritual right now?

2044
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,540
That's why there's smoke.

2045
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,260
It's possible.

2046
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:14,860
Wait a second.

2047
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,540
My name is Good Morning.

2048
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,380
I immediately thought of

2049
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,420
that legend everyone in Tuitu Village believes.

2050
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,540
If I could make

2051
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,860
the scene of the old master's murder look like this too,

2052
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,620
then his death

2053
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,540
could be blamed on this frequently fulfilled legend.

2054
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,460
Just put everything over there.

2055
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,860
Let's move the chairs over and eat together.

2056
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,060
You haven't played X Game?

2057
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,340
The detective doesn't play either.

2058
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,100
You're still trying to get information out of me.

2059
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,540
First time with the Chinese style.

2060
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,860
But actually, I'm most afraid of the Chinese style.

2061
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,500
I just feel that scary stuff

2062
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,940
really drains my energy.

2063
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,100
Because today we

2064
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,460
went through some special segments.

2065
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,340
So the production team prepared red envelopes.

2066
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:00,780
Thank you.

2067
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,140
Thank you.

2068
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:04,940
No, really, it's a lot.

2069
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,020
This time, Dilraba gave me a task.

2070
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,140
Do you know what it is?

2071
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,020
To protect you.

2072
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,380
To take care of you.

2073
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,740
She's really nice.

2074
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,900
Really very nice.

2075
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,500
We just need to wake him up.

2076
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
He'll do CPR on his own.

2077
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,300
Yes, that's right.

2078
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,940
Brothers, our friendship wasn't in vain.

2079
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:21,780
How does that song go again?

2080
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,540
There's a singer in the back.

2081
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,660
Aren't you going to ask him?

2082
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,540
What?

2083
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,780
When you turn around, what about this singer?

2084
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,820
If the moon hasn't come yet,

2085
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,860
what else do I need to do?

2086
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:38,620
No way.

2087
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,820
I don't believe anyone can do it.

2088
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,380
I'm not eating anymore.

2089
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,860
What the heck?

2090
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,700
This game

2091
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,860
isn't something ordinary people can play.
