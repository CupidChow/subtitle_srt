1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,560
The real culprit is

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,520
Good morning

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,320
So you are X

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
In the old master's room,

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,200
I found evidence that he killed my father.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:32,960
At the same time,

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
I also found a birthday celebration painting

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
and a note.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,720
The note said that mixing two liquids

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,600
would create a blood-like effect.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,440
This birthday painting and the method of "creating blood"

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,240
immediately made me think of

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,200
that legend everyone in Tuitu Village believes.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,600
Mixing human blood with paint while creating a painting

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,960
can draw the master of blood into the world of the painting

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
allowing them to live forever within the painting

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Until a certain opportunity arises

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,960
they can return to the human world from the painting

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,000
The reason everyone believes this

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,519
is because

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,400
strange disappearances always happen in Tuitu Village

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
cases of mysterious missing people

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,320
People vanish

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,560
and in the paintings at the scene

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
the image of the missing person appears

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,120
then the canvas starts to seep blood

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
If I can make

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,520
the scene of the old master's murder look like this

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,600
then his death

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,120
can be blamed on this frequently fulfilled legend

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,960
Right after, in the old master's room

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,880
I found a ritual procedure

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,560
It said

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
he would give me a birthday painting at tomorrow's birthday banquet

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,600
and then lead everyone in a summoning ritual

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,680
This ritual will take place in the sealed main hall

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
and in complete darkness

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Everyone needs to stand at the four corners during the process

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
and follow the order he assigned

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,160
taking turns to walk forward alone

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
to tap the next person's shoulder

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,040
At position 2 in the main hall, there is a hidden door

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,680
that leads to a secret collection room unknown to others

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
This secret

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,800
was something I

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
discovered by accident

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
while searching for ancient paintings in the house

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,240
At the same time

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,280
I also have an ability that no one knows about

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,360
which is

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
Kill the old master

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,840
Hide his body in the collection room

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Make everyone think he vanished into thin air

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,920
Then find a way for everyone to see

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,880
that his portrait has appeared on the birthday painting

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,880
and that the canvas is bleeding

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,800
This way, the blame can be perfectly shifted onto the legend

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,920
I copied down the ritual sequence and positions

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,800
Then I took

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,560
the note, the birthday painting from the old master's room

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,200
and a pair of porcelain vases

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
and brought them all to the collection room

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
On the birthday painting

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,280
I drew the old master's portrait

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
After the ink dried

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,320
I took the small piece of rice paper I had cut

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,640
and stuck it over the portrait

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
then drew the same patterns as the original painting

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
so that it looked

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
just like the original, seamless paper

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,640
After that

72
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,240
I poured the liquid from the white porcelain vase

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,760
onto the canvas

74
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
After the liquid had completely dried

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,000
I took the prepared painting

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,320
and secretly put it back in its original place in the old master's room

77
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, only the final step remains

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
How to, in front of everyone

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,440
make the yellow liquid flow onto the painting by itself

80
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,720
so that the canvas appears to bleed

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,480
I found a flyer in the house

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,840
It said that glutinous rice paper dissolves when it meets water

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,320
and will dissolve in forty-five minutes

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
This happened to remind me

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
that there is a wall with hanging paintings in the main hall

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
Above it is a brush-washing basin

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,400
Its board has a crack

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,480
Before the birthday banquet starts

89
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,760
I can place the glutinous rice paper over the crack

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,120
and then pour the yellow liquid on it

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
After forty-five minutes

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
the glutinous rice paper will dissolve

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,720
and the water will leak onto the canvas below

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,320
In the completely dark main hall

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
I practiced the ritual route by myself several times

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,720
to make sure the plan was foolproof

97
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,760
So

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I took the glutinous rice paper from the pastry plate in the room

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,640
and placed it properly in the brush-washing basin

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
Then I poured the liquid from the yellow porcelain bottle onto the glutinous rice paper

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
After that, I put all the used items

102
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
and the dagger I had prepared

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,280
into the collection room

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
Then I left the main hall

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,320
At twelve o'clock

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
everyone came to the main hall for the birthday banquet

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,480
After the birthday wishes

108
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,280
the old master really did have everyone perform the ritual together

109
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,640
just as he had written on the paper

110
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,880
He was in position one

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
I was in position four

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,240
After the lights went out, everyone started the first round

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,280
When it was my turn to walk near the painting

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,920
I tore off the rice paper from the painting as I passed by

115
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,280
revealing the old master's portrait

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,960
When the circle was completed,

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
I tapped Number 5 at my original starting point.

118
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,080
Number 5 kept moving forward.

119
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,240
He tapped the old man.

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
Then, before the old man reached Number 2,

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,640
I went ahead and tapped Number 2 on the shoulder.

122
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
Number 2 thought he was tapped by the old man.

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,760
He continued as usual to tap Number 3.

124
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,680
After Number 2 left,

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,600
I opened the hidden door next to Number 2.

126
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,080
I stepped into the collection room.

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
I grabbed the dagger.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,520
When the old man walked straight to my side,

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,040
I covered his mouth.

130
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,320
And stabbed him to death with one strike.

131
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
Then I quickly

132
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,760
threw the small rice paper I had on me inside as well.

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
And closed the hidden door.

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,720
I hurried back to my Number 4 spot.

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
And waited for Number 3 to tap me.

136
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,640
After Number 3 tapped me,

137
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
I pretended nothing had happened.

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
Then walked to Number 5 and tapped him.

139
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,200
Then I immediately overtook Number 5

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,320
and stood in the spot where the old man should have been, Number 1

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,200
pretending to be the old man caught by Number 5

142
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Then I kept pretending to be the old man

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
and walked forward to tag Number 2

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,280
After that, I returned to my own

145
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,520
spot as Number 4

146
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,360
After that, I didn't go back

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,600
to the old man's Number 1 spot

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
and pretended to be tagged

149
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,760
At this moment

150
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,600
Bai Deboyi, standing at Number 5

151
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,520
couldn't tag anyone

152
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,040
After he exclaimed that there was no one

153
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,520
everyone found the lamp

154
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,800
and turned it on, discovering the old man was gone

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
On the birthday painting, out of nowhere

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
the old man's portrait appeared

157
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,080
The glutinous rice paper started to dissolve

158
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,720
Water leaked from the brush-washing basin

159
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,560
and the canvas began to seep blood

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Ning, this episode's X game challenge is

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,360
You need to, within the time limit

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
flip over all the cards in front of you

163
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
and reveal them all

164
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,080
Alright, this is my weakness

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm not very good at this

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's go

167
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,640
So accurate

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
Good luck with my hands

169
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,360
Right, so I should flip this one

170
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,880
Pig

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Deer

172
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,200
Wait a second

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,880
Flip it over first

174
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Shark

175
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,400
Dog

176
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,600
Shark-dog

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Deer

178
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,200
Cat

179
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,760
Pig

180
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,440
Hedgehog

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,720
Milk (cow)

182
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
So many kinds

183
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,920
Shark

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Where was the shark just now?

185
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Whale

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
The shark is here

187
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,200
Here

188
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,200
Hedgehog

189
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,840
Octopus

190
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Hedgehog, octopus

191
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,920
Lion

192
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
Cow

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,039
Dog

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,919
And also

195
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,200
Chicken

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,680
Chicken

197
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,480
Cow

198
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Hedgehog

199
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,320
Dog

200
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Pig

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Octopus

202
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,280
Hedgehog

203
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,040
Where was the hedgehog again?

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,880
Lion

205
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,000
Dog

206
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Me

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,360
No

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,440
Pig

209
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Lion

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,760
Lion

211
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,960
Hedgehog

212
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Hedgehog

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Hedgehog

214
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Hedgehog

215
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,480
Octopus

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Octopus

217
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,560
Octopus

218
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Clownfish

219
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,280
Clownfish

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,600
Cat

221
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,920
Cat

222
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,520
Cow

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,880
Dog

224
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,520
Dog

225
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:34,800
Dog

226
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,840
Cow

227
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,320
Alright, all done.

228
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Jin and He

229
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,000
Then let's choose Jin

230
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Jin

231
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,880
We have to win today

232
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
Wait a moment, let me check my phone

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Because I'm asking Zhang Linghe

234
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
If he wants me to use it

235
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Let me analyze it for everyone

236
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,160
See, I really can't figure this guy out

237
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,560
I said

238
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,600
I said I still have a rebound card

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
Do you think I should use it?

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,080
He sent a question mark and said I was threatening him

241
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,440
See, how can people always think the worst of others?

242
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,280
Then I said, I sent three smiley faces

243
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,480
I said "hehehe"

244
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm just asking you

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,200
He said, "I believe you must be"

246
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
doing it for your brother's good

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
When he said this

248
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,000
My colleagues and I all thought

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,360
he doesn't want X, right?

250
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,560
I said, but I'm just not sure

251
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,120
You know, with his personality

252
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,560
you have to ask him directly if he wants it or not

253
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,360
So I said

254
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,040
Does the younger brother want it or not?

255
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
He said he wants it

256
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,800
Alright, just give it to him.

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
Today, we must

258
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
catch this culprit.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,080
So I've decided to use the X Rebound Card.

260
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Alright, it's time for our classic segment again.

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
If you were the culprit,

262
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,680
which one of us would you pick as X?

263
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
You're really good at pretending to be clueless.

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Yesterday, I went straight to sleep after arriving at the hotel.

265
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,280
Now it's the pressure test round, right now.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
Of course, I would pick

267
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,760
the "deceased" boyfriend.

268
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Your turn.

269
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,680
I would definitely pick you.

270
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,840
Pick me?

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
Why is there that

272
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
deep, intense look in your eyes?

273
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,080
I would definitely pick you.

274
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,760
Because I remember last time,

275
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,280
I picked He as my X,

276
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
and we both lost.

277
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,440
I pick you too.

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,000
Really.

279
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,080
That's interesting.

280
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,160
What about you? Who do you pick?

281
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,840
I pick the two butterflies.

282
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
You pick him?

283
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Yes.

284
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,520
He wants to make it a tie, right?

285
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm making it a tie.

286
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
This way, it's easier to stay hidden.

287
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,080
Alright.

288
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,720
Let's go confirm X.

289
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
Come on, it's time to confirm X.

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It's my favorite moment again.

291
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm actually a bit nervous now.

292
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Look.

293
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,480
Look, observe him for a bit.

294
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Why are you looking at me?

295
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,120
That smile looks a bit stiff.

296
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,840
A bit stiff.

297
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
A bit stiff.

298
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
That smile looks a bit stiff.

299
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,160
Bro.

300
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
Bro.

301
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,960
But I have to act a bit more awkward.

302
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,640
Bro.

303
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,200
You guys forgot something.

304
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,600
What is it?

305
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,960
She has a card.

306
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,480
What card?

307
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,240
A privilege card.

308
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
What privilege card is related to X?

309
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,480
Yes.

310
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,280
She has a conversion.

311
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,440
She can turn the other person into X.

312
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
Who has it?

313
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,560
Who has it?

314
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,680
Jin has it.

315
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,960
Has anyone used this?

316
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
Only she has this card.

317
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,320
No one else has used it.

318
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay.

319
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
Wait, she's back.

320
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,400
She's back.

321
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
She's adjusting herself right now.

322
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,240
Smart.

323
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Smart.

324
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,440
So smart.

325
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
I know who it is now.

326
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,800
No one should try to look into my eyes.

327
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,480
We won't look into your eyes.

328
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880
Your actions have already revealed who it is.

329
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,800
Pulling something like this this morning...

330
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,640
You two can argue for a bit.

331
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,720
There's nothing to argue about.

332
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
Actually, I want to ask you both something.

333
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,480
If you really were the culprits,

334
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,880
would you have told the truth

335
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,520
or lied in that last round?

336
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,360
In my opinion, those two would probably tell the truth.

337
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,480
But I'm not sure about him.

338
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
What about you?

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
Me? Mind your own business.

340
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
So you judge others,

341
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,240
but don't let others judge you?

342
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
Well said.

343
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
I never said you couldn't judge me.

344
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,320
I never stopped you.

345
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
Seriously.

346
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,320
What do you think?

347
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,120
If you were the culprit,

348
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
and you picked an X,

349
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,000
in that last round,

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,720
were you telling the truth or...

351
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,320
Of course I was telling the truth.

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,160
Because I don't lie.

353
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,080
Because I don't lie.

354
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
Who doesn't lie?

355
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,960
Last time you were the culprit,

356
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
you said you don't lie.

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
But you're lying right now.

358
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,080
No, I'm not.

359
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,280
I want to hit you with this stick, I...

360
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
No.

361
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
When I play the culprit,

362
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
I've never lied.

363
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
I just selectively withhold information.

364
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,720
But everything I say is true.

365
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,840
I can't believe there are people like you in this world,

366
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,240
so shameless

367
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,800
and brazen.

368
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Now I know where I stand.

369
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Me too, I know where I stand now.

370
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
I know where I stand.

371
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,080
Come on.

372
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,120
Text message

373
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,240
No one sent one

374
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,720
It's Bai, right?

375
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,160
Bai has been trying to clear me of suspicion all day

376
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,280
He probably wanted to pick me from the start

377
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
If it really is him, this is going to be tough

378
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,680
Sending it so slowly

379
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,000
It's him

380
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Play it by ear.

381
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,080
It's considered half open.

382
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,840
I can play openly.

383
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,360
Or I can keep my cards hidden.

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,880
Depends on the situation.

385
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
Let's see how Jin tries to trip me up.

386
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,000
If she goes hard on me,

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,440
then I have no choice but to play openly.

388
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,800
Let's see what she can do to me.

389
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,520
Alright.

390
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,800
Perfect.

391
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Did you use your card?

392
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,400
Ahe

393
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,400
What's up?

394
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,760
Can I trust you?

395
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
Trust me about what, X?

396
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,599
I am X.

397
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,200
I asked if I can trust you.

398
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,880
Why are you calling yourself X?

399
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I am X.

400
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,960
I am X.

401
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,640
Do you still admit you're X?

402
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
I don't want to admit it anymore.

403
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,599
It's too scary.

404
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,640
Dance with me.

405
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,000
I am X.

406
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,920
I feel embarrassed.

407
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,280
I don't want to dance this dance here.

408
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,200
X

409
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,960
Are you on the same team as Sister?

410
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,200
I'm tired just watching you.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,960
Are you on the same team as Sister?

412
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,960
Sister promised to give Little Walnut

413
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,280
to shoot some materials.

414
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,240
Shoot with me.

415
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,480
Materials, hurry up.

416
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,160
Come on, dance with me.

417
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,080
I am X.

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
You're a good person, just have fun.

419
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,440
Jiawei

420
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
I've always been having fun.

421
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,000
You better have fun this round.

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,160
I trust you more this round.

423
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
Next, our detective will

424
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,840
host for a bit.

425
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,880
My head feels so heavy today.

426
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,320
I almost fell over when I leaned back.

427
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Let's continue.

428
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
What should we do now, husband?

429
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,600
I choked.

430
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,520
Given that my wife

431
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
is so frail and sickly,

432
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,720
I think we can already

433
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,640
rule her out first.

434
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,600
Rule her out? Are you talking about this show?

435
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
Yes, just ignore her.

436
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
It affects our real judgment.

437
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,080
Then I'll head to Baiyun Airport first.

438
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,960
If I have to open the door,

439
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,560
If it's me who has to open the door,

440
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
You can't, you can't open it right now.

441
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,680
If you open it, he'll go right through.

442
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Right, so I can't open the door this round.

443
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,360
Right?

444
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,040
Move again.

445
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,840
Move again.

446
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,040
He needs to go a few more rounds.

447
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,600
I know.

448
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,840
Okay.

449
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,680
Then I'll go.

450
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,440
That's not right.

451
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,880
It's the same, so the logic is the same now.

452
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,920
Then it can only be the person in front or behind.

453
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,560
Alright, then I'm the culprit.

454
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,760
I'll try the white spot first.

455
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm the great-grandfather.

456
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
The great-grandfather is leaving.

457
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,240
Go.

458
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,920
Great-grandpa leaves.

459
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
He has to tag.

460
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,800
When he tags you, he can kill you.

461
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,080
Actually,

462
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
He kills you and opens the door.

463
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,320
Push the door open and throw you in.

464
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Close the door in one go.

465
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,680
No.

466
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
So what you mean now is,

467
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,440
I kill him (the old grandpa) now.

468
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Open the door, throw him in, and keep going.

469
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,360
But on paper, he was already inside waiting for me.

470
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,880
Right, that's not correct.

471
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,440
Wait for me to go in.

472
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,040
Okay.

473
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,680
Okay.

474
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Then I'll rule that out.

475
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
I'll rule out this method.

476
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,040
I can't do it either.

477
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,040
No, he doesn't have to.

478
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,440
For example,

479
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,120
If I were him,

480
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,720
As soon as great-grandpa leaves,

481
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,280
I go back.

482
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,320
Tag her first.

483
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,680
I let her go first.

484
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,480
I let you go.

485
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,640
Then I open the door and wait for great-grandpa to come in, right?

486
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,880
The one before also works.

487
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,240
That works too. Let me simulate it.

488
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,480
Come.

489
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,640
Go.

490
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,120
Go.

491
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,000
Who does Yue tag?

492
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,360
When it gets to me, there's no one left.

493
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,440
That won't work.

494
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,200
He can't do it.

495
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,360
Let's just assume

496
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,920
this is already the N plus one-th round.

497
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,600
You're getting ready to kill him this round.

498
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,720
You rush over first and take out Yue.

499
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Okay, I'm going.

500
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,040
Go.

501
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm running fast.

502
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm leaving now.

503
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,400
Okay.

504
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Then you go over and kill him.

505
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,480
See, I'm moving.

506
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
But that's not right.

507
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
Now there's no one on Ke's side.

508
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,160
You open the door.

509
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,800
You open the door at this moment.

510
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,720
Open the door and come in.

511
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,080
Hurry and run back.

512
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,760
No, he's going to kill someone.

513
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,480
I have to kill you.

514
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,200
I have to stab you to death.

515
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,520
He still has to kill someone.

516
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,640
No, then only Yue can do this.

517
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,440
Look.

518
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm the great-grandpa, right?

519
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
No matter how many rounds we go,

520
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
no matter how many rounds,

521
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,800
when I move forward,

522
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,040
the person in front of me is always Yue.

523
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,800
Right.

524
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,320
Yue's position can definitely be the killer.

525
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,920
Okay, locked in.

526
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Let's vote.

527
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
So what was our final standing position?

528
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
Isn't it obvious then?

529
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
If we can reconstruct the final positions,

530
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,360
At the end, I was standing like this.

531
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,000
My last position was here.

532
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Who was there at the end?

533
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,320
Wouldn't that person be the killer?

534
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,360
Why?

535
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
Yes, it's you.

536
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
See, you finally found a spot.

537
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,800
You locked onto me.

538
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,520
After searching for so long,

539
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:06,840
finally,

540
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,320
it's you.

541
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,120
Fine, it's me.

542
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,720
I understand now.

543
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,360
So his logic is,

544
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,040
after I finished this,

545
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,200
then I killed inside,

546
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,800
and as soon as I came out,

547
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,920
it was morning.

548
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,640
Morning.

549
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,600
Finally found it.

550
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Impossible.

551
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,120
That's not right.

552
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,720
Hey, don't protect your own people.

553
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,200
You're wrong. What's wrong?

554
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
Then I want to ask,

555
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
why was the great-grandpa in this position

556
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and disappeared?

557
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,000
Because great-grandpa is about to disappear.

558
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,120
And he disappears at this spot.

559
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,800
Because great-grandpa disappeared there.

560
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,920
Then,

561
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,240
So who did you take a picture of?

562
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,080
Who did you take a picture of?

563
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
When you were here, who did you photograph?

564
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,440
What if the person I photographed there was the culprit?

565
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,200
It was me.

566
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Then I should be in front of you.

567
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,520
I should go.

568
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,120
No, let me think.

569
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,800
If I come over here

570
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,120
who am I tagging

571
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,720
who is it

572
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,800
the killer

573
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,360
you go

574
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,160
if you are the killer

575
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,360
the elder is already gone

576
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
you pretend to be the elder

577
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll go

578
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,320
you go over

579
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,400
tag Yue

580
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,240
tag Yue out

581
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,320
Yue has gone over

582
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,880
then you move a bit forward

583
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,720
just a little

584
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
how is that possible

585
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,360
go

586
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
I find there's no one here

587
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,520
I go back again

588
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,040
then he's back in the right spot

589
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,680
impossible

590
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,040
Ke, there's no one here now

591
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,320
you're totally framing me

592
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm speechless

593
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,600
no, you can't

594
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
because you think it's me

595
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,640
won

596
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,320
victory

597
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
I regret spending ten minutes

598
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,000
listening to you just now

599
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,160
you're an X

600
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,320
you're an X

601
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
no, I don't think you can be ruled out at all

602
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
do you know why

603
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,840
after the elder died

604
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
you all could still play many more rounds

605
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
Let's do a simulation now.

606
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,160
The old master is already dead.

607
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,600
Okay.

608
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
There are only four people left.

609
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm the killer, look.

610
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,920
Go.

611
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,400
Alright.

612
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
I walk back.

613
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,880
What he said makes sense.

614
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,320
Walk all the way back.

615
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
After one round, tap again.

616
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,720
At this point, isn't there no one here?

617
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
I just walk another round.

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
I directly tap this person's shoulder.

619
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
Then I walk back again.

620
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,120
Tap him again.

621
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
You can play many, many rounds like this.

622
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,200
I think the killer has enough time.

623
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,120
To return to their spot.

624
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Plenty of time.

625
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
If we're talking about the secret room,

626
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,720
you're the most suspicious.

627
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,840
Because you're the butler.

628
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,000
You're very familiar with the layout here.

629
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,960
You know it very well.

630
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,720
He might have tampered with things.

631
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,760
And he might have been following the old master all along.

632
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,040
Because he was always working together with the old master.

633
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,960
I want to make a point.

634
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,640
First, the premise of today's story

635
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,600
is this:

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,520
the few of us

637
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,840
were invited to play the role of the butler.

638
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,320
I recruited those three.

639
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,720
The four of us are in this mansion

640
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,840
for a month each.

641
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,400
So the information we can gather is actually

642
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
the same.

643
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,680
I think the most crucial point now is

644
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,360
we've never actually tried

645
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,560
the murderer's route.

646
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Should we try it again?

647
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,120
Of course, I think it's necessary.

648
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,240
We don't have to go all the way there.

649
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,920
Let's just stay at these four corners.

650
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,760
Let's say this is the grandpa.

651
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,640
This is the secret room.

652
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,400
This is the secret room.

653
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,040
This is the secret room.

654
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
This is the secret room.

655
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,480
Okay.

656
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,120
Look.

657
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,160
She is without a doubt

658
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,960
capable of doing it.

659
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,600
Right?

660
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,400
No need to explain that.

661
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,960
That's right.

662
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
If it were you,

663
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
the grandpa would walk over.

664
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
You'd have to move her away before the grandpa arrives.

665
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,200
Then open the door.

666
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,120
Wait for the grandpa to pass.

667
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,640
Then for me,

668
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,200
there's no one left for me to move.

669
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,440
He basically finished one thing in triple the time.

670
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,960
Right, so his suspicion is the smallest.

671
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Alright, let's try to deduce it now.

672
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
For example, what if it's Ning?

673
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,000
Let's assume it's Ning.

674
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,320
The elder walks over.

675
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,160
Ning goes to tag her.

676
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,840
Then she leaves.

677
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,440
Right.

678
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,320
She left.

679
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,880
Wait for the elder.

680
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,680
The elder.

681
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,360
Has gone.

682
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,480
Then continue.

683
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Finish him off.

684
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,960
Then he has time and comes back.

685
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,400
No.

686
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,640
There needs to be one more person.

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
So basically,

688
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,000
That's why I said it.

689
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,760
Isn't that the problem?

690
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,320
After I go back, won't there be no one left?

691
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,440
If there's no one, who are you going to tag?

692
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,000
Wouldn't you realize it here?

693
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,840
So, following this logic, it can't be Ning either.

694
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,960
If you put it that way,

695
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,240
then it's impossible for me too.

696
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,320
Come on, let's try it with you.

697
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,280
Come on.

698
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm coming, let's go.

699
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Ready to go, right?

700
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,520
Right? I tagged her.

701
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,520
Then I come here and open the door.

702
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,280
Tag.

703
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,000
Then,

704
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,560
Okay.

705
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,200
Then I come back.

706
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,120
You can.

707
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,920
Tag me.

708
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,320
You left.

709
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Then I pretend

710
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
to go over and tag her.

711
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,720
Then I can do it.

712
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
I can totally do it.

713
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Then that's it.

714
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
You're the best at this.

715
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,400
That's me.

716
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,720
Just you.

717
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
You can choose when to stop.

718
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
It's all up to you.

719
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,520
I just suddenly thought of something.

720
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,560
It's about what we just said, being able to move through.

721
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Walking inside.

722
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,920
Can you move through?

723
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
I have a question.

724
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,520
Go ahead.

725
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,400
You're too idealistic.

726
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,720
You move diagonally in the dark.

727
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,320
That's the key point.

728
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Who can move diagonally in the dark?

729
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,560
Did you forget what her role is?

730
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,960
What role do I have?

731
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,280
She's the escape room NPC.

732
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,560
If it's her,

733
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,200
she wouldn't have to do anything, it would make perfect sense.

734
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,040
You know that, right?

735
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,680
If we go by

736
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,600
the way we just ran,

737
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
if we rule her out,

738
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,720
then it's only him left.

739
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
If he's the culprit,

740
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,240
I wouldn't have brought this up at all.

741
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
Because there would be no one else.

742
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Do you think this is shooting yourself in the foot?

743
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,760
Hurting yourself with your own actions?

744
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,160
Yes.

745
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
But if when picking up the stone,

746
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,280
he doesn't look at himself before throwing it,

747
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,360
where would he throw it?

748
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
I think he's innocent.

749
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
Prime suspect.

750
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Good morning.

751
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
Good morning.

752
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,160
Prime suspect.

753
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,120
Ning.

754
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
This vote goes to Bai.

755
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
The prime suspect is

756
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:56,880
Bai.

757
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,040
Bai.

758
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,040
Who did you choose?

759
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
There's no need to lie now.

760
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,840
Just tell the truth.

761
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,720
I chose you.

762
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,560
I really am

763
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,440
Alright, you X

764
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
It's confirmed

765
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,120
How am I X again?

766
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,880
Confirmed as X

767
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,440
You really didn't play well today

768
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,120
I'm pretty average every round

769
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,680
So I voted for him in the end

770
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,880
You voted for him?

771
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,320
Yeah

772
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,840
Then you're X

773
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,440
If you voted for him, then you're X

774
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,040
Is it possible there's no X at all?

775
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,800
This round's a mess

776
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,280
Impossible

777
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,560
It's over, I've been exposed

778
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
It's over, I voted wrong

779
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,400
Voted wrong

780
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,400
Good vote

781
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
You voted for him

782
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,280
Yeah

783
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,120
Then you're the same as him

784
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,360
Yeah, my goal is

785
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,240
As long as I influence one person

786
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
That's a win for me this round

787
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,280
Yeah

788
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:40,920
Not bad

789
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,480
That's fine

790
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,560
Now it depends on who the other X voted for

791
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,120
You're X, and there's another X?

792
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,480
When did you start thinking I'm X?

793
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,840
Just now

794
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
Because I voted for you

795
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,040
Yeah

796
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,960
You're really turning it back on me

797
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
You turned on me way too fast

798
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
You're done for

799
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,040
The real culprit is

800
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,680
Good morning

801
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
So you’re X.

802
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,600
He really didn’t do it today.

803
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,520
He didn’t accuse anyone.

804
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,400
He didn’t slip up at all.

805
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,440
Really, not a single slip.

806
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,520
Actually, today I...

807
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,240
acted with integrity.

808
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,840
I don’t think so.

809
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,360
I’m just a bit curious.

810
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,280
He guessed me really accurately.

811
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,280
Why is that?

812
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,320
Yeah, why did he...

813
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,520
How did you guess him right from the start?

814
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,040
Just a wild guess.

815
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,360
He really did just guess.

816
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,920
But he guessed me so accurately.

817
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,640
Both times he guessed me, he was spot on.

818
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,960
How is he so accurate?

819
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,320
He knew it was me right from the start.

820
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,880
Yeah.

821
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,360
You know, this kind of...

822
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,240
But when you guess others, you’re never right.

823
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
He just puts pressure on you.

824
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,080
Yeah.

825
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,800
You couldn’t handle it.

826
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,760
You must have shown some weakness.

827
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
No, let me tell you.

828
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,320
I even went home and reviewed everything today.

829
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,480
First, I didn’t talk to him today.

830
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,440
Second, I didn’t target him.

831
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
Third, I didn’t do anything.

832
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,000
You should have targeted him.

833
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Yeah.

834
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,880
You should have gone after him hard.

835
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,960
Last time, I stepped on him.

836
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,040
So he targeted me.

837
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,920
This time, I didn't step on him.

838
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,760
But he still targeted me.

839
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,280
So, it doesn't matter.

840
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
He's being a bit unreasonable.

841
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,000
He's really being unreasonable.

842
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
His guesses are really accurate.

843
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,080
Yeah.

844
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,920
It's just A, B, C, or D.

845
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,760
I always pick A.

846
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,240
Eventually, I'll get it right.

847
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,880
Yeah, that's right.

848
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,240
I can't stand it.

849
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,640
I can't accept this from you right now.

850
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,720
This family relationship.

851
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,280
I'm going back to my own room.

852
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Okay.

853
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,280
Alright, how about this.

854
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,680
Okay, then you two take the main room.

855
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
We'll go over there.

856
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,640
The two of us will sleep in the main room.

857
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,000
Sleep wherever you want—even on the street.

858
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,760
Sleep wherever you want.

859
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
I have my own room.

860
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,960
Go back to the dump and eat trash.

861
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,360
You shouldn't stay anywhere.

862
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
Leave Good House.

863
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,960
Go back to the dump.

864
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
"Trash kid."

865
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,600
Alright.

866
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay.

867
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,040
You really hate him.

868
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,760
You really do hate him.

869
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Their intense hatred toward me,

870
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,640
did you feel it?

871
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,480
Some people are just like that.

872
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,320
In the game,

873
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,800
you really can lose some of your humanity.

874
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,720
Yeah.

875
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,480
Exactly.

876
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,120
Let me tell you, this season is really great.

877
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,680
Who do I think is especially great?

878
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,640
Lao Bai is especially great.

879
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,200
He’s amazing.

880
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,960
Honestly, last season, overall,

881
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
for example, his commitment to the game

882
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,640
was only about sixty percent.

883
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,360
But this season,

884
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
he’s up to ninety percent.

885
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,240
Yes.

886
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,400
Absolutely.

887
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
He takes the game super seriously.

888
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Really.

889
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
Very seriously.

890
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
His face gets red and his neck bulges.

891
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
He really does.

892
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,160
I’m really happy.

893
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,440
Really.

894
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,400
I’m truly happy.

895
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,760
Because I think it’s like this:

896
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
He genuinely likes our show,

897
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,800
or he considers us friends.

898
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
That’s why he’s willing to play with us.

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,560
It makes me really happy.

900
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,200
He would, yeah.

901
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,760
See? Really.

902
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,440
Bro, you’re so kind.

903
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
He’s really thoughtful.

904
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,080
You’re still speaking up for him even now.

905
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,520
That’s just how it is.

906
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
I see the good in everyone.

907
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,720
It’s really true.

908
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
It really is.

909
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,480
He can't suppress his smile anymore.

910
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,200
I think today's MVP

911
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
still goes to Jin Jing.

912
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,280
How should I put it,

913
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,840
even though she didn't provide

914
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,280
any particularly strong evidence

915
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,240
to prove who the culprit is

916
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,120
or who X is,

917
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,280
every episode I can feel

918
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,440
that she can, through subtle expressions

919
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,160
and her understanding of others,

920
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,600
very accurately pinpoint

921
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,680
who is lying

922
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,560
and who is really hiding something.

923
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,280
So I still decided to vote for her.

924
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
This episode's MVP

925
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,200
I think should go to He.

926
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,920
Although this episode he was my X,

927
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,840
throughout the whole process,

928
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,720
every point he made,

929
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,600
every detail, every twist,

930
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,240
including

931
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,680
the tacit understanding we had during the final vote,

932
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
none of it was discussed beforehand.

933
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,640
At first, we decided to vote for Yue,

934
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,040
but he adapted to the changes in the game,

935
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,840
and in the end, he voted for Bai with me.

936
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,320
Even though we didn't win,

937
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,120
I still think

938
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,200
he made great progress in playing as X

939
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,480
and improved a lot.

940
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,800
So I think he played really well this episode.

941
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,320
So my MVP for this episode

942
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,680
goes to He.

943
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,800
Today's MVP

944
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,720
is Jin Gou Bai Ou.

945
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
The reason is

946
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,280
with her vote,

947
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,640
we were able to achieve a complete victory.

948
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,880
A Jin was really awesome.

949
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,480
Not bad.

950
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,360
I think Bai is the one.

951
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Because he was the first

952
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,960
to identify the real culprit.

953
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,640
And then

954
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,680
also, today his

955
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
whole reasoning process

956
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
and the way he participated were both very

957
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,160
motivating for everyone.

958
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,560
I think this time was pretty accurate.

959
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,720
Today's MVP should be Zhou Keyu.

960
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,960
Because every time

961
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,160
when he's analyzing the logic,

962
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
I always feel he's very convincing.

963
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,040
Even though he voted wrong in the end,

964
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,680
he still put in a lot of effort, if not results.

965
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960
A pretty good MVP.

966
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
This episode's MVP,

967
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,760
I decided to vote for Bai Deboyi.

968
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,600
Because I think he showed

969
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
when he was a good guy,

970
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,640
the kind of attitude that really lets others tell

971
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,400
whether he's a good guy or not.

972
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,560
He successfully helped a lot of confused good guys

973
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,120
to rule him out.

974
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,280
I think Bai's mindset and logic

975
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,000
and his desire to survive at the end

976
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,840
made me feel he was really invested

977
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,200
in playing this game.

978
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Yesterday I found out Ba couldn't come to this episode.

979
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,560
So I told Ba,

980
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,120
"If you can't come, I'll really miss you."

981
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I was really sad.

982
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,560
But she reminded me of one thing.

983
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,840
She told me to take good care of Shen Yue.

984
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,360
And today,

985
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,600
in a lot of scary moments,

986
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,440
I was startled at first,

987
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,640
but the next second,

988
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,560
I called out, "Shen Yue, where are you?"

989
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,720
And at that moment, I suddenly realized

990
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,800
that I had become like Reba used to be.

991
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,560
Because she used to be really scared too,

992
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,360
but after being scared,

993
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,160
the first thing she would do was look for me.

994
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,760
And at that moment, I felt

995
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,040
that was the strength she left me.

996
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,080
And for the first time, she made me feel

997
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,520
that when you are in the darkness

998
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,280
and you learn to want to care for others,

999
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,560
you forget the fear of the darkness.

1000
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,960
It was that feeling, at that very moment,

1001
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,080
that made me feel she was with us.
