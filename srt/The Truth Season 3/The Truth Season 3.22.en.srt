1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,600
Wait a second, who's knocking?

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,600
Don't move.

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Make a bowl of noodles.

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
This spicy chicken noodles are really hot.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,600
The chili in your mouth is biting you.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,880
Delicious.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,520
He's in this season of the show now.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,480
Acting like a dad everywhere.

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,800
You're the only one who hasn't done it.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
I haven't.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Soon.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,480
No, just a younger brother is fine.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm used to being a foster father.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,480
There's no need for that.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
I survived.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,480
Don't worry, you can't get away.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
No.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
You definitely can't escape.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
Isn't this room a bit...

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
So scary.

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
No way.

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
You guys are so mean.

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,720
Is this water sound fake?

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,080
There's no water at all.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
It's all just sound.

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Is someone getting close to me?

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't do this kind of thing.

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,280
Wait a second.

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
Wait, who's knocking on the door?

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Who's knocking on the door?

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Don't mess around with this stuff.

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,280
Teacher.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
Actually, it's pretty good if it's just a bit blurry like this.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
It will have a smoothing effect.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
After finishing, listen to it individually.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,440
The whispers from the sea.

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,640
Alright, I'll listen then.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
I forgot to take the bucket.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,360
Wait a second.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,520
If someone touches me along the way here,

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
my legal team will come after you.

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
Don't touch me.

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm begging you.

44
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
Don't jump out.

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I really can't handle this.

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,160
Don't move.

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,480
No, it's too dark.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,320
I can't see the road.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,520
I can't see the road.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,600
No.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Don't touch me.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't mess with me, I'm begging you.

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
Don't suddenly jump out and touch me.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
I'll really get angry.

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll say things that can't be aired.

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
How do I catch it?

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,520
I can't catch the water.

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,600
All I can do now is cry.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,720
Then I'll fill this bucket with my tears.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm begging you all.

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
Don't mess with me, seriously, don't.

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Where's the water?

63
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,600
Could there be a mouth inside the bucket?

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes.

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Not at this moment.

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
Don't suddenly scare me from behind.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm warning you.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,440
That's too much.

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,560
Who?

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Task completed.

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,480
Open the door and let me in.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,320
Scared me to "death."

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
Scared me to "death."

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,840
I can't open it.

75
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
It must be Bai Yu.

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
It must be Bai Yu.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,480
Let me check my makeup.

78
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Luckily, I'm still so beautiful.

79
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,920
No talking, please face this way.

80
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,080
Let's meditate for a bit.

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,360
Why is it so dark?

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,680
He poured the water so quickly.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Editor.

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,960
Please speed up the part where I pour the water.

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,200
Edit it more boldly, okay?

86
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,040
Because this is the persona I want to establish this season.

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,080
A strong female lead who's not afraid of anything.

88
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay.

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,280
It's poured in.

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,840
That sound isn't pouring water, it's collecting water.

91
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
I thought he would be much faster.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
There's water over there.

93
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,400
My bare-leg cover is showing.

94
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,200
It doesn't look very natural.

95
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
You'll never be able to buy

96
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
the most natural-looking bare-leg cover.

97
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,280
Girls, just give up.

98
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,120
Why is there blood on my door?

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Are you trying to frame me as the culprit?

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll tell everyone in a bit.

101
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,320
Someone is definitely trying to set me up.

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
I dropped my ring.

103
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,520
My ring fell off.

104
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
Didn't Liu Yuning say

105
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
we'd change our personas this season?

106
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Where's my sink?

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
I can't find the sink either.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Turn on a light for him.

109
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Alright, where's my door?

110
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Alright.

111
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
After pouring the water, he started pretending to be calm.

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
Okay, it's locked.

113
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
Let me make a statement first.

114
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
If this light

115
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,280
suddenly turns off later,

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,600
I'll really get mad.

117
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,040
Everyone is going to get knocked.

118
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,280
Do you know what I'm doing?

119
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm strengthening my spleen.

120
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
Many women have a weak spleen.

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,720
But they don't know how to strengthen it.

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,880
They buy a lot of food.

123
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
I suggest you don't buy anything yet.

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
Do tooth tapping with me.

125
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,160
Tooth tapping is good for the spleen.

126
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
Many women have asked me,

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,480
"Is tooth tapping really good for the spleen?"

128
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
What about GUCCI?

129
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm not talking about the brand bag COACH.

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm talking about tapping your teeth.

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,200
To be honest,

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,480
it's actually hard for me to get through this.

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
Zhou Keyu

134
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,800
Kuang

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Do you think one plus one can be greater than two?

136
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Why are those two so calm?

137
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
They want to add numbing and spicy flavors.

138
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,840
Can the director hear us?

139
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,680
Send someone out to scare them.

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
Check if there is any.

141
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
Is there a light? This area is huge.

142
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,720
What's wrong?

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
What is this?

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
I bumped into something.

145
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,760
What is this?

146
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,720
A wooden cabinet.

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Wait a second.

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,800
What's wrong?

149
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,120
This is mine.

150
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,240
This is my bucket.

151
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,800
This is yours.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,040
This is my bucket.

153
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah.

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
What's this?

155
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
Here, the water is here.

156
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,120
I touched the water.

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,840
Wait a second.

158
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,440
You touched the water?

159
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,120
Yeah.

160
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,440
Here.

161
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
Why did water splash all over my face?

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,960
Where's the NPC? Come out and scare them.

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,000
The one that just scared me.

164
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
It really freaked me out.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Will this actually scare them?

166
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,280
Not enough.

167
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,080
Let me out.

168
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
The handle on the bucket fell off.

169
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Yeah.

170
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
So now I have to hold it with both hands.

171
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm warning Zhang Linghe not to make

172
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,800
not to make

173
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,200
this kind of sound again.

174
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,520
It doesn't match your face.

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,960
Not enough, do a bit more.

176
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,520
It didn't scare them.

177
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
I'm really not satisfied.

178
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,160
So disappointed.

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,120
I want to see Zhang Linghe cry.

180
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
If you want to see it, type "1" in the chat.

181
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
I want to see him so mad he smashes that cabinet.

182
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,240
Have you seen that clip?

183
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,200
Like this.

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,560
Those two

185
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,280
aren't going to squeeze into

186
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
a tiny space together, are they?

187
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,920
Are we both supposed to sit in there together?

188
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,560
Definitely.

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,320
What's wrong?

190
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,200
Who?

191
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,000
Who?

192
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Ning.

193
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,400
Where are you?

194
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm to your left.

195
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,120
Is this it?

196
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Yeah.

197
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
Are you all here?

198
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,600
Just me.

199
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
What about the others? Have you seen them?

200
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,160
No, I haven't.

201
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,880
Muted.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,560
Can't talk.

203
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,080
Can't talk, right.

204
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
My hair's all messed up.

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
It's not messed up, it was like this when I came this morning.

206
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,120
You got extensions, right?

207
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah, extensions.

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,320
So long.

209
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,080
It took all morning.

210
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,960
Nice, looks cool.

211
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,560
Don't say that.

212
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,720
Coming in alone was really scary.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
I couldn't handle it myself either.

214
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
They won't just keep us here like this, will they?

215
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,200
Can't talk.

216
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Do you guys want to eat skewers or Northeastern cuisine?

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Northeastern cuisine.

218
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
I chose hot pot.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
I want a "everything can go in the hot pot" session.

220
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
We already have hot pot, let's pick another one.

221
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,040
Let's just eat one thing at a time.

222
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,560
Let's just stick to this for this episode.

223
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,880
Since we have hot pot, then...

224
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,400
I'll go with skewers.

225
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,720
Then let's have a BBQ.

226
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Anything's fine, I don't mind.

227
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Skewers are okay, right?

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:35,880
Doesn't matter to me.

229
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,760
Northeastern cuisine next episode.

230
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm good with anything.

231
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,920
Tomorrow, Northeastern cuisine.

232
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Anyway, I also picked hot pot.

233
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Because I just heard someone chose hot pot.

234
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,840
I don't want them to have to prepare more.

235
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,760
I also saw that he picked hot pot.

236
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,480
So I chose something else.

237
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,680
No, my hot pot is that...

238
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,360
It's the one from the production team.

239
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Anything's fine.

240
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,080
Everything can go in the hot pot.

241
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,680
Hot pot.

242
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,720
I know, me too.

243
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,400
Anything's fine.

244
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,240
Let's do BBQ today.

245
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Let's have skewers, skewers.

246
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,320
There's BBQ.

247
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,280
BBQ and hot pot together.

248
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
I want to wait for Reba to come and take a photo with her.

249
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Ba.

250
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,920
Take a photo sitting down, I want her to sit here with me.

251
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,360
I thought you wanted to take a photo with me.

252
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't want to take a photo with you.

253
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
Ba, come here quickly.

254
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Come over here, sit here.

255
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
I want to take a photo with you.

256
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,440
What do you mean?

257
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
Because today, with her,

258
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
the theme is twin sisters.

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
I want to take a photo with her.

260
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
Daughter, goddaughter.

261
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,280
She said she wants to edit herself to look like you.

262
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,400
Yes, I want the staff to edit me

263
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,000
to look exactly like you.

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,920
She wants to edit you to look like her.

265
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
One more.

266
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
This is a big job.

267
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
Don't make me laugh.

268
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
One more photo, last one.

269
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,120
Wait, what expression are you making?

270
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Okay.

271
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,480
A cool one.

272
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,040
With cat ears.

273
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,280
Like a rebellious girl.

274
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,520
Even the fingers need editing.

275
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,560
Okay, who is this?

276
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,640
No one left.

277
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,280
No one left.

278
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,520
We only have six guests in total.

279
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,720
What do you mean?

280
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,360
Why?

281
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,800
I need you.

282
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,800
Oh no, we didn't get a good spot for the hotpot.

283
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,920
So anxious.

284
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,080
I thought the hotpot was already boiling.

285
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,200
I didn't get a good seat.

286
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,480
You can sit here too.

287
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,760
Come over here.

288
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,880
Okay.

289
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
I've got some here too, I've got some here too.

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,920
There's some there too, alright.

291
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,920
Detectives, let's host for a bit first.

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,320
Okay.

293
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,800
Let's eat and summarize at the same time.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,360
Alright.

295
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,640
Sure.

296
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,040
Alright.

297
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,560
Eat.

298
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,000
Wait a second.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
There's a problem with eating and summarizing at the same time.

300
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,080
You can't hear this person talking.

301
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Later, you might say the wrong thing.

302
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,280
No, for people like us with superpowers,

303
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
there's no problem.

304
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
No, you're "mentally challenged."

305
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,640
Don't forget, you always lose your memory.

306
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
You don't actually have superpowers.

307
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,000
You only have the intelligence of a one-year-old.

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,560
Okay.

309
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,720
Because you relive your life every time.

310
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Restart your life.

311
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,400
Restart your life.

312
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,320
Ning Reception, can you handle the reception work?

313
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,720
Can you bring the hotpot over here?

314
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
Bring it over?

315
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll do it.

316
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,960
Thank you, thank you brothers.

317
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,080
I didn't move.

318
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,560
That's why I didn't thank you.

319
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,880
Then what am I?

320
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I'm not a big brother or a little brother.

321
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,120
Thank you.

322
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,640
Thank you.

323
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
Thank you.

324
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,440
I'll hand them out.

325
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,520
I'll help you.

326
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,240
Don't use those chopsticks to pick up raw meat.

327
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
My booklet—sorry.

328
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Do you all know where your booklets are?

329
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,200
Right?

330
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,920
In my hand.

331
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,360
What about mine?

332
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,200
Sorry, where's my booklet?

333
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not here.

334
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
Serve a bowl of noodles.

335
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Bai, look for your booklet.

336
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,960
Let me look.

337
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Where's my booklet?

338
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,000
Where is my booklet?

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,760
I don't know either.

340
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
Earlier, we...

341
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,600
Weren't we just in that room? I remember.

342
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,440
This spicy chicken noodles are so hot.

343
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Weren't all the booklets in this room just now?

344
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,040
Brother, this...

345
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Whose booklet is that?

346
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,720
Yours.

347
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Mine.

348
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,119
What about yours?

349
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,760
Mine is here too.

350
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,079
These spicy chicken noodles are so hot.

351
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah, it's a bit spicy.

352
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,760
So spicy.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm really not hungry.

354
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,359
Otherwise, I could really eat a lot.

355
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,839
Ning isn't eating.

356
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,480
There are skewers.

357
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,240
Grilled skewers, let's eat.

358
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,800
There's barbecue—over there.

359
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,120
He

360
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,600
He, do you want to eat?

361
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
It's fine, just leave it here.

362
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Spicy chicken noodles.

363
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Where did you get this?

364
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
How do you have this?

365
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,280
Let me give you a bit more.

366
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,600
Thank you.

367
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,880
Thank you.

368
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Thank you.

369
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Where are our bowls?

370
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,880
There aren't any here.

371
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
Do you want some vegetables, darling?

372
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll have some vegetables.

373
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay.

374
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,840
I see the bowls.

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,640
It's fine, you do it.

376
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,320
Let me hold it for you.

377
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,000
Thank you.

378
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,400
To be honest,

379
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
it's getting a bit hot with these two hot pots in here.

380
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,040
Yeah.

381
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
Why can't I get this bowl out?

382
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,000
Got it out.

383
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,240
Today, let's just stick together.

384
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,360
All the way to the ends of the earth.

385
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,240
Always together.

386
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Shut up and eat.

387
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,040
To the ends of the earth.

388
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,840
You are the wind,

389
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,120
I am the sand.

390
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
Always together.

391
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
I saw you guys

392
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,120
when you went on "Hello Saturday".

393
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,280
You rushed forward, and then he...

394
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,280
You said, "Why are you backing up?"

395
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,440
He's always like that.

396
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
You just walked right into my...

397
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,840
What are you dodging for?

398
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,560
You're always like this.

399
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,920
You embarrass me in front of others.

400
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,040
But in private, you bring me soup.

401
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,600
You ask me, "Did sis come to Hengdian today?"

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
But you never show it in public.

403
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,760
Silly.

404
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I'll leak all your chat records.

405
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
So what do you usually talk about?

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,560
He has to coax me.

407
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
He says, "Did you come to Hengdian today?"

408
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,720
I'll welcome you.

409
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,840
Are you filming today?

410
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,080
My mom made soup and sent it for you.

411
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,600
But in front of the camera, it's like this.

412
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Yeah.

413
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,720
How scared are you of being shipped with me?

414
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
Getting caught up in rumors.

415
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,840
You're really scared, aren't you?

416
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
Can't handle it.

417
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
Hey, should we switch seats, little bro?

418
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Can't take it.

419
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
Just bear with it.

420
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
Don't rush, little bro.

421
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
Your time will come.

422
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,800
There will be something just for you.

423
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,800
Pulled off a wing.

424
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,000
You're really good to me.

425
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,480
Only you are truly genuine.

426
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,560
You're nice to me in private,

427
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
and just as nice in front of the camera.

428
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Not like some people.

429
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,440
There's no lighter.

430
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,960
No lighter.

431
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
There's really no flame.

432
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,800
Don't you guys have a "gun"? Isn't that fire?

433
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,600
There's fire.

434
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
A lighter, right? That's it.

435
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
We don't have that.

436
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,040
No more alcohol.

437
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,760
No alcohol.

438
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,200
Are you done?

439
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,920
You're eating spicy chicken noodles.

440
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,280
Watch your hand.

441
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Very good.

442
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,520
Let me make you some wings.

443
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Is my shirt see-through?

444
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,600
It's okay.

445
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,400
It's not see-through.

446
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,840
It's fine.

447
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,520
It's not see-through.

448
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,480
It's not see-through.

449
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,840
It's alright.

450
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,080
It's not see-through.

451
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,720
Are you sure?

452
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,120
It's not see-through.

453
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
It doesn't hurt.

454
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,480
It's not see-through.

455
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,960
It's not see-through.

456
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,200
Let me take a look.

457
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
Don't do that.

458
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
It's see-through, see-through from the side.

459
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,040
Don't stick it out, you're right.

460
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,480
Just tuck it in a little, that's good.

461
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,640
What?

462
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,720
He's worried.

463
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,600
He's afraid his shirt will show something.

464
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,240
Brother Ning

465
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,280
Big Dad

466
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,560
What's up?

467
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,400
Any ideas?

468
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,440
You want to join my family too?

469
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm already part of your family.

470
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,080
That's right.

471
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,680
He's acting like everyone's dad on this show now.

472
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
He was a dad last season too.

473
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,520
And a dad this season as well.

474
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,480
Last season he was a brother.

475
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,160
Who said that?

476
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,040
Isn't Jiawei's dad him?

477
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,560
Dad

478
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
Good son

479
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,680
He was her brother, her brother.

480
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
And then your brother, both of you.

481
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,440
And my brother too.

482
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,600
Right.

483
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,880
I know, I'm talking about you.

484
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,600
The first to be your brother.

485
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,160
So today, he's basically been everyone's dad.

486
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,520
Except me.

487
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,960
You're the only one who hasn't done it.

488
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,120
Never done it.

489
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,080
He hasn't. He was my younger brother.

490
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,320
But he's never been the next generation.

491
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,240
Right, he hasn't.

492
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,760
Very soon.

493
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,920
Then being a younger brother is fine.

494
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
You'll find out tomorrow.

495
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
You're another child I gave birth to.

496
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,920
Then that means you were born to someone else.

497
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
If you don't know,

498
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
you can also take him as a godson, right?

499
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm used to being a foster father.

500
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,080
Used to being a foster father.

501
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,840
I survived.

502
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,120
He became your grandfather.

503
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,520
We didn't.

504
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
The two of us aren't related by blood.

505
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,520
Don't worry, you can't escape.

506
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,560
No.

507
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
You definitely can't escape.

508
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,440
Because you're all about the same age.

509
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,320
What he said makes sense.

510
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,760
Right?

511
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
All twenty-two or twenty-three years old.

512
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,280
You two are even the same age.

513
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,080
You're all the same age.

514
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,480
How nice.

515
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
How nice, it's like going back ten years.

516
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,920
Maybe he's also someone who's getting younger.

517
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,160
His kidneys have already failed.

518
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,840
He looks like a lively young man.

519
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,800
But his kidneys have already failed.

520
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,440
Do you want to cook something in your pot?

521
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,520
It's not on.

522
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,160
It's not on.

523
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,600
It's not on.

524
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,560
The main thing is, it's not on.

525
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,760
How about we wait until the heat is on?

526
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,120
Let's talk first.

527
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,480
Let's chat first.

528
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's chat for a bit.

529
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,520
Let's chat first.

530
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,920
Let's just talk.

531
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Then let's put more things in first.

532
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Then put it in, just put it in first.

533
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,680
Whatever, just put it in.

534
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
Let's just keep it on like this for now.

535
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
Let's just chat, that's all.

536
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,920
Are you still okay?

537
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,440
It's delicious.

538
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,320
You can really handle spicy food, right?

539
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
This looks really spicy.

540
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
It's not even on, what are you putting in?

541
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,880
Just put it in and let it cook.

542
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,640
It doesn't matter anymore.

543
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,240
Then put that bowl of beef balls in too.

544
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,960
It's so spicy.

545
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,720
The chili in your mouth is biting you.

546
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,120
What do you want?

547
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
That disposable cup.

548
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,040
This is soup.

549
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,440
This is soup.

550
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,200
A water cup, right?

551
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,520
This is soup.

552
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,280
Look how much you want it.

553
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,160
You just have to eat this.

554
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,720
It's delicious.

555
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
It's so spicy I can't take it.

556
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,760
Want to drink?

557
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm alive again.

558
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,640
So good.

559
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,120
Let's take a selfie together.

560
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
Let me show you something.

561
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,640
Let me show you something.

562
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,120
What is it?

563
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,520
Do you know how much effort I put in?

564
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,640
But you didn't have to.

565
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,280
Why would you?

566
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,520
You don't have to do this.

567
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
Say it again, that I don't have to.

568
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
If I post it like this,

569
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
it doesn't look bad.

570
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Who’s going to take our picture?

571
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,680
Are you using your phone to take it, or should I?

572
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,000
I’ll take a selfie.

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,800
You know,

574
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,520
our selfies always turn out so bad, right?

575
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,720
Fine, but can’t you edit them?

576
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,000
Then it’s fine, let them take it.

577
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
Use that one.

578
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,360
I’m going to strangle you!

579
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,840
Why?

580
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,720
I fell for it again.

581
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
But honestly, bro,

582
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,240
does what I told you even help?

583
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,920
What did you say?

584
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,440
I told him,

585
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,880
I told him not to get so worked up.

586
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
Every time he plays the killer,

587
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,320
he gets so hyped up.

588
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,080
In the end, he falls into a self-fulfilling trap.

589
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,520
Like, “What about me, what am I doing?”

590
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,880
Last time, he was shouting so hard his veins popped.

591
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,560
This time, it’s not necessary.

592
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,320
This time, she and that other person started fighting.

593
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
I didn’t need to do anything at all.

594
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,720
It’s because you didn’t have any part in the middle.

595
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
There weren’t any signs.

596
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
So she couldn’t suspect you.

597
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,920
You little troublemaker.

598
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,880
Come take a picture for me!

599
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,560
That makes sense too.

600
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,000
Don't make it look too much like a posed photo.

601
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,320
We just don't want that.

602
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,040
So what should we do?

603
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,280
A couple who met in Milan.

604
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,440
And there's a specific scenario.

605
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:17,720
Right.

606
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,040
No.

607
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
You're like one of those street style bloggers.

608
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
With your beautiful girlfriend.

609
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,720
Coming to Paris.

610
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,160
Alright.

611
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,120
Okay.

612
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,360
The Eiffel Tower is right behind you.

613
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,960
Take a photo like this.

614
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
You walk this way, I'll walk that way.

615
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,280
Pass by each other.

616
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,520
Okay.

617
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Then look at the camera.

618
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,640
Okay.

619
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
But don't get too close.

620
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,960
Look at the camera, right?

621
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,480
Right.

622
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,560
Then take one without looking at the camera.

623
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,000
Why?

624
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,760
Why is there no affection in your eyes?

625
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
You need to show that kind of affection.

626
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,400
Are you the director now?

627
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,640
Are we filming a romance drama?

628
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,560
I'm the director of photography.

629
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Let's show some affection.

630
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm the director of photography.

631
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,120
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

632
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,560
Of course you're laughing till you cry.

633
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,440
You're so proud, you beat me.

634
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,720
You're really happy, aren't you, Bai Yu?

635
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm so mad, I just went back to the car and...

636
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,880
My head is buzzing.

637
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
It's the first time someone has made me this angry.

638
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,280
No, this isn't my fault.

639
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
You two were arguing by yourselves this time.

640
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
It has nothing to do with me.

641
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,480
I'm mad, I'm really mad.

642
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,080
Feels good.

643
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,600
Not bad.

644
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,320
This technique is actually pretty good.

645
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
Stop being so smug.

646
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm "dying" of anger.

647
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,280
Let me see the ones with me and Zhou Keyu.

648
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,960
This is so beautiful.

649
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,880
So fateful.

650
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,160
Okay.

651
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,760
So sweet.

652
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
This is so sweet.

653
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,560
Okay.

654
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Okay.

655
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,320
Who is the photography teacher?

656
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,680
I want to ask you.

657
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,240
Do I look very different from Reba?

658
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,320
We just took a photo here.

659
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,560
A photo of me and Dilraba as twin sisters.

660
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,040
I'll take it back.

661
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,520
I'll go back to the car.

662
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,400
My staff showed me that photo.

663
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,840
I asked, "Why did you edit Dilraba?"

664
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,720
They said they didn't edit it.

665
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,560
You still have so much energy.

666
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
Failure really does make people angry.

667
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,120
She came and beat me up first.

668
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,640
Good job beating me.

669
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,840
That's fine.

670
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,480
What do you mean?

671
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,720
It's okay.

672
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,840
I think I know you pretty well.

673
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,360
And you know what?

674
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,400
In that last round,

675
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,280
there was actually a pretty risky moment at the end.

676
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,760
There was a slightly dangerous part.

677
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,000
Go on.

678
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,480
When you were pulling Ning,

679
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
you pulled him too hard.

680
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,040
That makes sense.

681
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,640
Yeah.

682
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
I'll be more careful next time.

683
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
I must not have any desire.

684
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,480
Of course, that's just for you.

685
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,120
Everyone is different.

686
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay.

687
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,480
That's how you are.

688
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,320
Because usually you have no desires or wants.

689
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,840
Alright.

690
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
So when you do have desires,

691
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,440
there's a problem.

692
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,160
Right.

693
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,240
It's like that with everything.

694
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,200
This round, I will...

695
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,840
I'll hide it.

696
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,880
No way, it definitely can't be you this round.

697
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,840
I'll hide my desire this round, okay?

698
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,320
Did you win three rounds in a row back then?

699
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,400
Or was it two in a row?

700
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
Have you ever been voted out?

701
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,800
When it was three rounds,

702
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
I won them all anyway.

703
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So you won three in a row.

704
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,680
That's pretty impressive.

705
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Murderer for two episodes.

706
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,560
The killer is fun.

707
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,200
Back in our first season,

708
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,640
the killer was actually the easiest role.

709
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,120
No one knew each other's personalities.

710
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,680
It was hard to figure people out.

711
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,360
I seriously asked the director,

712
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,560
what exactly is the issue between the two of us?

713
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,040
He said,

714
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,960
from an objective third-person perspective,

715
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
yes, he said our personalities

716
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,440
are both very good at leading the pace.

717
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,120
People like that are hard to get on the same page.

718
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,440
But once they do agree,

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,800
the killer has nowhere to run.

720
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,840
But the hardest part is

721
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,280
for them to reach an agreement.

722
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,680
You know those two,

723
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,400
do you know what their trick was today?

724
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Zhou Keyu told him not to talk.

725
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,480
Just let the two of us keep talking.

726
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,000
The heat never gets to them.

727
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,320
You two are still analyzing.

728
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,160
Even though the show is really entertaining,

729
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,840
but

730
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
it makes us look pretty foolish, right?

731
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,120
Not really.

732
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,560
You were a bit impulsive today.

733
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,360
You kind of...

734
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,760
Last episode, I was the one being subjective.

735
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,560
I trusted him.

736
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,680
Today, your suspicion of me was totally wrong.

737
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
I was completely innocent today.

738
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,200
I've never been this innocent before.

739
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,000
But you still picked me.

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,480
Yes.

741
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,400
Before, you could vote for me, that was fine.

742
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,160
Today is the day I'm most innocent.

743
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Yeah, I got carried away too.

744
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,040
But we just kept talking and talking.

745
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,920
It was a waste of time, right?

746
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,240
But will we get scolded?

747
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
No.

748
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,320
You had your highlight moment today too.

749
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,600
You hid the identity of a murderer.

750
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,400
If we both stayed calm,

751
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
I would have agreed and ruled you out.

752
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,160
Or just stopped discussing it.

753
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Then we could have seriously analyzed those two.

754
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
The more he talks, the more mistakes he'll make.

755
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,280
We can't rule those two out.

756
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
Actually, in the end,

757
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,200
we cleared everything up.

758
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,800
It's just a choice between two.

759
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,520
Actually, it doesn't exist.

760
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,360
You didn't choose wrong.

761
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,960
Right, you didn't choose wrong between Reba and him.

762
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Choosing me was the wrong choice.

763
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,240
Yeah.

764
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,560
But if it were between him and Reba,

765
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,200
I would definitely vote for him.

766
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,160
Because I know there's nothing wrong with Reba.

767
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,040
I don't believe you would vote for me.

768
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,280
I really would.

769
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,240
No, you wouldn't.

770
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,320
We have interviews later, you can watch them.

771
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,080
No, it's useless.

772
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,800
It's all hindsight.

773
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll release it.

774
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,880
I really don't think Ba fits.

775
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,960
So the real culprit was narrowed down to

776
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,720
between Ning and Bai in the end.

777
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,520
It's all hindsight, it's useless.

778
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,280
After it's over, you can say whatever you want.

779
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Teachers,

780
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,840
let's arrange our positions.

781
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,000
Come on, you do it.

782
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,880
You seemed a bit anxious today.

783
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,120
Really?

784
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,600
Yeah.

785
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,960
Who seemed anxious?

786
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,320
Him.

787
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,120
See, I told you.

788
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Especially those who know you well.

789
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,360
They can definitely tell.

790
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,800
I'll change up my strategy a bit.

791
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,640
Daytime is the most dangerous time.

792
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
Right when you...

793
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,680
...showed up.

794
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,360
So you asked me twice who I was voting for.

795
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
At that moment, I thought it was you.

796
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,480
At that time.

797
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Because I felt you were a bit anxious today.

798
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,560
Because you brought it up then.

799
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,360
At the time when we were eating together.

800
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,440
When we were having that meal.

801
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,920
You kept saying,

802
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,120
"Bro, whoever you vote for, I'll vote for too."

803
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,120
That's fine.

804
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,840
Mentioning it once is okay.

805
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,920
But you brought it up three times.

806
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
You really want to stick to this persona.

807
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,120
So I feel like you're up to something.

808
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,760
Trying to cover for yourself.

809
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,240
That's how it is.

810
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,840
Everything else is fine.

811
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,440
Okay.

812
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,680
I'll remember to lower my head.

813
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,520
Today, my manicure...

814
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,400
...has to be shown no matter what.

815
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,560
What's this?

816
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,120
I'm deliberately showing off my nails.

817
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah, let's get a low angle shot.

818
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,480
What does low angle mean?

819
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Do we need a low angle?

820
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
No, just lower the camera.

821
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,360
Right.

822
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,800
What are you wiping?

823
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:21,800
Cleaning the window.

824
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,520
Okay, come here.

825
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,240
Sit up straight.

826
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,400
Come over.

827
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,280
A little lower, very good.

828
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,800
Come on, excellent.

829
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,360
Come here, sit down.

830
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,400
Jin, sit back a little.

831
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,600
Your face looks too big, right?

832
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,200
No.

833
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,560
That's fine.

834
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,040
Very good, come on.

835
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,720
Let's do it again.

836
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,320
One more time, come on.

837
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,280
Very good, come on.

838
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,680
Okay.

839
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,600
Let's look here, come on.

840
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,320
What gesture are you making?

841
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,800
I want to do it too.

842
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,480
Look here.

843
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Three, two, one.

844
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,880
You look like you're begging.

845
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,840
Give me five yuan.

846
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,480
Give me money.

847
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,040
Give me something to eat.

848
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,360
Okay, I won't do it anymore.

849
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,840
Tip me a little, boss.

850
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,520
A family photo, really.

851
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,400
Family photo, everyone.

852
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,560
Family photo.

853
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,360
Come on, three, two...

854
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,840
At least I didn't hold you back this time.

855
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,320
When you picked me, I was still worried.

856
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,280
I thought, "If you pick me, that's going to be bad."

857
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Why would picking you be bad?

858
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,920
Mainly because when you first came back,

859
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
your performance was a bit rough.

860
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,200
But you got a bit better later on.

861
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,520
I'm the only one sitting.

862
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,440
Yeah.

863
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,520
You deserve it.

864
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,360
Because if you stand up, you'll block Bai.

865
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480
Right, you have to look out for the older folks.

866
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Or you could stand up there.

867
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,160
You can step up with one foot.

868
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
Then look forward like this.

869
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,800
Wait, what are we doing?

870
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,640
After the coin is tossed up,

871
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,160
we just...

872
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,040
just keep your eyes on that light.

873
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,080
No need to come down.

874
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,880
Don't come down.

875
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Just keep watching the coin, right?

876
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,280
Look at that light.

877
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,360
The light is too high, you can see the whites of your eyes.

878
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Look at the lifebuoy.

879
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,120
Look at the lifebuoy.

880
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,240
Yes, look at the lifebuoy.

881
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,080
The upper edge of the lifebuoy, right?

882
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,880
Okay.

883
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll toss it up in a moment.

884
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,280
At first, we'll chat.

885
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Chat.

886
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,920
Yeah, three.

887
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,800
Just chat naturally.

888
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Yeah, three.

889
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,320
I mean, none of you have this script?

890
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,880
What?

891
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,440
None of you have this script?

892
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,120
No script.

893
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
Just a bunch of hooligans.

894
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,640
A bunch of hooligans here, what are we even doing?

895
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,480
Doing that kind of thing.

896
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,920
Very streetwise, that kind of thing.

897
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Really?

898
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,080
We need to act streetwise, right?

899
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,880
This is from the production team, of course.

900
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,360
Haven't seen it.

901
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,480
Everyone, we're about to start filming.

902
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,280
Okay.

903
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,719
Alright, let's go.

904
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,800
Just look at each other, give a sideways glance.

905
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,760
How is it now?

906
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,360
Three, two, one.

907
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,040
Then Teacher Reba can take the coin.

908
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,880
That was tossed too fast, I didn't even see it.

909
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,199
I didn't even have time to react before it was tossed.

910
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,520
I almost missed her throwing the coin.

911
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,800
A basin of water was thrown out.

912
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Can you flick it like this?

913
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,560
When I say three, two, one, then toss it.

914
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,080
Then do I need to get close to her? Is that okay?

915
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,600
Yes.

916
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
Will this scene be too harsh?

917
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,719
It will.

918
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:49,920
It will.

919
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,679
Do we need to be this close?

920
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,239
So I can be seen, I'll stand here.

921
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
A little more forward in the middle.

922
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,840
Okay.

923
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
We can interact a little.

924
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,520
How so?

925
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,160
Nice nails.

926
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Today is nice.

927
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,680
Get ready.

928
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,280
Three, two, one, toss.

929
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,760
This task shouldn't have been given to me to toss.

930
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Good, very good.

931
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,920
I think this take—

932
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,400
Is it possible like this?

933
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,920
I can't do it.

934
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
If I could, I would have done it like that.

935
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
Three, two, one, go.

936
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,640
Okay.

937
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,040
Absolutely fine.

938
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,600
Alright.

939
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,800
I'll be the bartender.

940
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,920
Gotta add a bit of drama.

941
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Do you want props?

942
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
Who wants them? Anyone?

943
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,880
Who wants one?

944
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,960
Turn around.

945
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
Does anyone want props?

946
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,520
No need.

947
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,400
Or we can each take one.

948
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,720
Then when we come down, we clink glasses.

949
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,920
And then strike a pose, is that okay too?

950
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,000
We can't hold the glasses.

951
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,560
Why not?

952
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,640
We're not allowed to drink.

953
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,320
Alright.

954
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,600
Then can we hold the ice bucket?

955
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,080
Okay, that's fine.

956
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,960
The bully takes the ice bucket.

957
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,360
Three, two, one.

958
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,200
Done.

959
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,480
Thank you, teachers. Thank you, everyone.

960
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,240
Thanks.

961
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's do it here, let's start here.

962
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,120
No.

963
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,160
Let's do it at our own places.

964
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,560
You have to catch a flight tomorrow, right?

965
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah.

966
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,320
I have to catch a flight too.

967
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,320
You're leaving tomorrow too?

968
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,560
You're filming, right?

969
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,360
You're almost done filming, right?

970
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,240
General.

971
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,720
When do you finish filming?

972
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,840
That's the general.

973
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,040
Playing the general.

974
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
In April.

975
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,960
Mid-April.

976
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,680
I finish filming earlier than you.

977
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,200
Who finishes earlier than me?

978
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,520
Me.

979
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,080
You only have twenty days left, of course you finish before me.

980
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,560
I want to have a little competition.

981
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
You guys ran out because of this.

982
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,480
I'll let it go this time.

983
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,480
Is he really volunteering for this?

984
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,000
Absolutely.

985
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
He's the brave one.

986
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,000
One, two, one.

987
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
This is Ke, the dance king.

988
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,200
A perfect match for the job.

989
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,000
Turn right.

990
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,160
All of this...

991
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,480
These are all easy jobs for him.

992
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
Turn around.

993
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,760
Bai Yu, you're so handsome.

994
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
I'm really speechless.

995
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:10,760
Braised food.

996
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,640
Braised food.

997
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,800
This squid is so delicious.

998
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,720
Sorry.

999
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,960
This thing is called "Hao Dadan."

1000
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,640
At night, each of us takes one.

1001
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,120
Then we won't lose each other.

1002
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Look, we're connected in a line.

1003
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,280
That's what it means.

1004
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Why don't you need it? Others do.

1005
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
Teach me how to do "Bai Qie Hei."

1006
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,440
Bai Qie Hei.

1007
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,280
What about "Qie Hei"?

1008
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,520
Then let's all do it this way.

1009
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,400
That Thai one.

1010
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Shouldn't we just scratch our heads at the start?

1011
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,240
Like this.

1012
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,120
Scratch your head.

1013
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,800
Scratch your head again.

1014
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,320
It's a bit silly.
