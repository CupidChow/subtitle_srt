1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,960
The deduction is dead.

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,320
He used other people's secrets to sign his own contract.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,000
Here are six sheets.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,960
What kind of outrageous contract is this?

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,880
It must have been the director who threatened this person.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,360
This person had a motive to kill him.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
The one who caused their friend's death.

8
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,760
No one's hands are clean.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,560
Everyone has caused their friend's death.

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,320
So that's eleven o'clock.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,080
Between eleven and eleven twenty-five.

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
What were you all doing during that time?

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
I was touching up my makeup in the break room.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
I was eating for twenty-five minutes.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
I had diarrhea.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
I was helping

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
Ba find a location to shoot a rustic-style video.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
So you were at this

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,160
You could show up anywhere.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,240
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,160
A little uncomfortable.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,840
I feel like you

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,680
Okay.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,400
Wait a moment.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Are you feeling a bit uncomfortable?

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,880
No.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,160
You know, from my angle

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,880
I can see his

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,760
face from this side.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
The veins are bulging.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
Next, we will enter

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,360
the X confirmation phase.

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,840
Wait, why are you acting a bit shy?

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,999
Your smile today

35
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:52,800
seems a bit forced.

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
Are you X?

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
Why do you care if I am or not?

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Why do I feel like his smile

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,040
looks a bit unnatural?

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
Drink some water.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,920
Is there something magical about our water cups today?

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,960
I want to ask, is there even water inside?

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,080
Let's go search the main office.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay, let's go.

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,920
What's in the main office?

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I think the assistant director's area

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,200
should be searched.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,680
Yeah.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
That area is pretty important.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Right.

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,320
Guys, I found something!

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,720
What is it?

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,400
What is it?

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,880
This is our black character card.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
The card on top.

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
I just took this from his office.

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,760
These are the character cards for everyone.

58
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,360
That means someone already

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
knew about it in advance.

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Each of our character cards

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
had the label on top

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,480
pulled out by him.

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,640
Why did he pull these out?

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,720
To look at all the words.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
He said these little secrets

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
aren't enough to threaten these six people.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
What do these little secrets refer to?

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Is it about us indirectly

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,120
causing our friends' deaths?

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,160
He said he could only write a few character profiles to test them.

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,040
But among them,

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,080
the one who caused a friend's death

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,120
is completely under my control.

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
He knows there's one person

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
who didn't kill indirectly.

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
Right, he only knows about one person.

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
So he writes these character cards

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
to test the others.

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,920
Yes.

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,680
To see if they'll reveal

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
any bigger secrets.

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,920
Yes, exactly.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,120
So actually,

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
the matter of indirectly causing a friend's death

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
he shouldn't know about at all.

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,600
He only knows

87
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
about one friend's death.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,200
Right.

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Because we've all killed someone.

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
The killer saw this

91
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
and thought the boss was talking about him.

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
So he killed him.

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,200
Because each of us shared

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
our own experience of causing a friend's death.

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,760
But the boss thinks

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
who actually caused the friend's death

97
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,600
is the most important point.

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
He writes these character cards to test others.

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,440
Right.

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,720
The killer saw this

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,000
and thought the boss was talking about him.

102
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
The boss gave out a card for the Grim Reaper.

103
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,320
The boss must have decided that person is

104
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,760
the one who caused the death.

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,640
Makes sense.

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,040
Right, so what's important now is

107
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
to figure out the identities of you four

108
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,840
and what your actual roles are.

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,560
The mole and the Impostor

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
don't matter anymore.

111
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
Those two are already confirmed.

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
So now we focus on

113
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,880
the Playboy,

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
the Coward,

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the Minion,

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
and the Grim Reaper.

117
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,560
So now it's possible that

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,080
the Playboy is one of us two.

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,440
Right?

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,160
Yeah.

121
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,640
Neither of us is a Playboy.

122
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,160
So, between our stories,

123
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,679
who do you think sounds more like the Playboy?

124
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,760
You seem more like the Playboy.

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,880
185 cm tall, eight-pack abs,

126
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,560
a 190 cm resourceful senior,

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,600
and a clingy 187 cm younger brother.

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
All the ones you go for are pretty tall.

129
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,280
He also gave two people slippers.

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,280
Ke Ban gave me a lot of glass slippers.

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,760
I wear these glass slippers every day.

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
He has two people, but I have six.

133
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,040
But didn't you say about the others...

134
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Are your connections based on resources?

135
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Her relationships are utilitarian.

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,640
Yeah.

137
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,440
But I use...

138
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,440
I use my looks.

139
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
Alright, you're a flirt.

140
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,400
Is she a lackey ghost?

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Helping others do bad things.

142
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,000
What's a lackey ghost?

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
If they go down, they have to drag others down too.

144
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
What other kinds of ghosts are there?

145
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,040
He's a coward.

146
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,800
He...

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
He doesn't even dare show his face.

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,520
At least you showed up.

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
Alright.

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,040
What else is there?

151
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,600
A deadly ghost.

152
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,840
He took two lives.

153
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Not necessarily a deadly ghost.

154
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,040
So the real ghost (the culprit), right?

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,320
Tentatively.

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
That's our best guess for now.

157
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
That's all we can deduce, yeah.

158
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,960
Keep searching.

What's wrong?

191
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,280
Please look.

192
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
WeChat administrative report group.

193
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Red carpet area setup is complete.

194
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,720
Women's restroom is locked.

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
Cleaning work has started.

196
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,480
These are all timelines, right?

197
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Yes.

198
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
There was someone in a private room.

199
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,640
It was you.

200
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,720
You were inside.

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,760
I had diarrhea.

202
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
I've been cleared of suspicion.

203
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
It only proves she was in there using the toilet.

204
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
Right, the next one.

205
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,240
He said someone asked to meet him today.

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,560
To meet at the abandoned warehouse.

207
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
There’s some huge gossip to share in person.

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
He probably went to the meeting.

209
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Someone arranged to meet him.

210
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,480
It’s the person who called after ten o’clock.

211
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,760
In a bit, we can

212
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,320
try calling him ourselves?

213
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,160
At 10:04

214
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,840
there was a 30-second call from an unknown number.

215
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,920
That call record

216
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Who knows the Billion Director’s work hours today?

217
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,120
Private chat.

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
April 22nd, 9 o’clock.

219
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,320
Same old rules.

220
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
This person is an information agent.

221
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,360
He’s the gossip center, right?

222
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,960
There’s an event today.

223
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,680
Yesterday I helped the boss on Tongcheng Travel

224
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,280
with six character cards.

225
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,720
They’ve always been kept in his office.

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,360
No one has seen them.

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
He only takes them out before the scene starts.

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,280
He just uses them for our rehearsals.

229
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,600
Right.

230
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,080
Character cards.

231
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
Yes.

232
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
If I go take a look in twenty minutes

233
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
and sneak a peek,

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
Okay, no one will be there before ten.

235
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,040
It’s safe.

236
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,480
His office door card is right there.

237
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,280
This person is the killer.

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,920
This person is the killer.

239
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,680
This one, yes.

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,439
Retire early

241
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,760
Who was that alternate account just now?

242
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
What did they talk to you about?

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
One eighty-eight point eighty-eight

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,880
Who is "Retire early"?

245
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,360
Retire early

246
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
So in this chat log,

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,720
what does it show?

248
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,040
It shows

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,520
the culprit went to inquire

250
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,680
It shows the culprit's prior motive

251
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,400
and how it was formed

252
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,720
Right

253
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,920
Okay

254
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,960
What time did the crime happen?

255
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Eleven twenty-five

256
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
From eleven o'clock to eleven twenty-five

257
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,800
We still haven't figured out

258
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
their method of killing

259
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Let's go back to the crime scene and take another look

260
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
I think so too

261
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Let's go

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
Feeling guilty like a thief, huh?

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
I sneeze and that means I'm guilty?

264
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,200
You're being a bit too aggressive with me right now

265
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,120
Come on

266
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
We need to search thoroughly

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Isn't this a strong light?

268
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,600
Something with a strong light

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
Who was that just now?

270
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,960
That famous one found something

271
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,640
A flashlight

272
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Come on, guys.

273
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
It can't come unglued.

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,480
Clear glue, super strong adhesion.

275
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,520
After about twenty-five minutes in contact with water,

276
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,880
it loses its stickiness.

277
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,360
There's another one here, and another one.

278
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
It takes forty-five minutes to freeze.

279
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Once the ice block is frozen,

280
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,360
it can fully melt in twenty minutes.

281
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
The moment you take out the ice block,

282
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,000
put it on the glue.

283
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,720
This glue can completely come off.

284
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Then things can drop down or fall.

285
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
Or whatever else could happen.

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Right.

287
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,720
Before we met the director,

288
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
he had already set up this ice block.

289
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
And this glue thing.

290
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,520
Then he just needs to invite the director here.

291
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,240
Give it to him.

292
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,880
Dazzle him until he faints.

293
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,240
If that strong light is a flashlight,

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
doesn't someone have to press it?

295
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,360
Right.

296
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,040
Someone definitely has to be there.

297
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,600
So this mechanism must create

298
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,280
the appearance that he's not present.

299
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,680
Right.

300
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Wait, why did this water turn black?

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
Because the floor is dirty.

302
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
When water meets dirt, doesn't it turn black?

303
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,680
No.

304
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,160
This black color isn't normal, is it?

305
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
It looks like ink.

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,880
I found it.

307
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,320
The one inside is this color.

308
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,320
So it’s possible that what’s inside is poisonous.

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes.

310
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,840
The poison has turned this color.

311
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Is that possible?

312
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,240
Yes, it could be that poison.

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,440
Look at his face.

314
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
See if his face has turned dark.

315
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Be careful, don’t—

316
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,800
His face is dark.

317
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,560
His face is dark.

318
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,680
It's his whole face.

319
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
It must have been covered over his face.

320
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Right.

321
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
So he rolled down with the cloth covering him.

322
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,280
Then how did the cloth stay on top?

323
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,760
And the person came down?

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
Did the cloth go back by itself?

325
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,280
You think this method works, this one?

326
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,160
That handkerchief was covering his face, right?

327
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,560
Yeah.

328
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,880
Then what was the glue for?

329
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Was the (bowl) glued to his face?

330
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,640
Because his face is round, see?

331
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,960
What do you mean?

332
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,360
Just put it

333
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,080
over his face.

334
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
When he came in,

335
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,480
it was put over his face.

336
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,440
It's like cupping therapy for the face, you know?

337
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,360
That's how Dudu lips are made.

338
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
You mean that?

339
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah.

340
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
I think this is too complicated.

341
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Let's go over the timeline.

342
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,560
So the killer

343
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,760
was there before 11:25.

344
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
So when would he wake up?

345
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
Around 11:20.

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Before 11:30.

347
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,400
Then why six minutes?

348
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,160
If he wasn't dead,

349
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,800
and wasn't unconscious,

350
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
why couldn't he survive?

351
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
That carpet.

352
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,600
If I relax now, I'll roll.

353
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,640
Because he was wrapped in that blanket

354
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,480
Would being wrapped up make him unable to move?

355
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
I think we need to

356
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
try rolling it up like this

357
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
then we wouldn't need to wrap that thing

358
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,080
It's possible there would be marks on that part

359
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,520
And at thirty-six, he was probably awake

360
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
but couldn't move

361
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,520
It's wet here

362
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,360
Is this right?

363
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,280
There's water here too

364
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Then

365
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
Then it's possible that's what happened

366
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,040
When this person was tied up inside

367
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
he was stuck with strong glue

368
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,760
so he couldn't move

369
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Stuck with strong glue, he couldn't move, right

370
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,800
Right

371
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
The glue needs to meet ice to melt

372
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,280
so it can be undone

373
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
So there must have been ice on top of this before

374
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,920
So even if he woke up here

375
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,400
It's not important.

376
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,360
He can't get out.

377
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,800
You can't hear any sound from outside either.

378
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,720
Because this is soundproof.

379
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,960
So, to estimate the time—

380
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,440
The moment the superglue comes undone, he falls down.

381
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,680
His face gets cut there and he dies, that's how it happened.

382
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,280
It's possible.

383
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,400
For now, that's the assumption, yes.

384
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,280
Wait a second.

385
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,280
How did that thing break over there?

386
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,240
Can someone explain that to me?

387
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,760
That was me—bang.

388
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,320
Bang.

389
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,680
Bang.

390
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,760
I came over and smashed it.

391
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,560
It's that simple.

392
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
Does it have to be complicated?

393
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
I set all this up.

394
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,000
I came over—smack.

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Bang, smack.

396
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Smack.

397
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Okay.

398
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,640
No problem.

399
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,040
The shape of these fragments must be from being thrown.

400
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
Yes.

401
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Let's wrap it up again and see.

402
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,960
Let's do it, come on.

403
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
This person is really heavy.

404
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,320
Alright, no problem.

405
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,800
Come on.

406
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,120
Let's go.

407
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
My clothes got all rolled up inside.

408
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,280
Then this is definitely something a girl couldn't do.

409
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
Right, the two of us are definitely not suspects.

410
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Come on, let's go.

411
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Alright, that's good, right here.

412
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay.

413
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,720
His foot was on that wall.

414
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,760
There really are signs of friction.

415
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,280
That's right.

416
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
What's going on now?

417
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
Now he's stuck with glue.

418
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah.

419
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,920
And then ice was put inside here.

420
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,280
The face comes out.

421
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,440
Pretend the head is outside.

422
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,640
No, his head is definitely outside.

423
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,400
Right.

424
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Definitely outside.

425
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,160
Okay, so where is the handkerchief?

426
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,760
I think...

427
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
Is it possible it fell down here?

428
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,320
Something or other.

429
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,160
It's possible.

430
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
Is it possible that something fell from here?

431
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Some kind of object.

432
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
The head must have been outside.

433
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,120
A block of ice that was frozen.

434
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
It can completely melt in twenty minutes.

435
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,760
After about twenty-five minutes in contact with water,

436
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,840
it loses its stickiness.

437
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Why did this water turn black?

438
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,600
The face turned black.

439
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
I set all this up.

440
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,440
I come over and—bam.

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,520
I get it now.

442
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
It was cut in advance.

443
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,040
I smash this bowl.

444
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,600
I use that blade to cut the face first.

445
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,600
After cutting, I tie it up inside.

446
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
Then I hang this thing up above.

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
When the time comes,

448
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,600
it falls onto the face.

449
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,400
At that moment, he dies.

450
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,920
It rolls down.

451
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,560
It rolls down.

452
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,520
That works too.

453
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,560
The logic is reversed.

454
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,360
The logic is reversed.

455
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Yes, that's it.

456
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
This is the most reasonable explanation so far.

457
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
I want to ask something.

458
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,760
He smashed it here.

459
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,040
He took this over there to cut.

460
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,200
Then put the pieces back here.

461
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,400
Why didn't he just take it away?

462
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,560
This is just a piece of misleading information.

463
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,280
To make everyone think it was a face-to-face conflict.

464
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,200
Cut and push, a hundred billion.

465
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,360
It's easy to create an alibi.

466
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,479
Alright.

467
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,920
Now comes the moment to witness a miracle.

468
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:09,960
Come on.

469
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,560
Three, two, one.

470
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
Help!

471
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
It really hit.

472
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,920
Right on target.

473
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,440
I think if the culprit is this meticulous,

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
he must have had

475
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
experience as an artist's assistant.

476
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
And why did he make ice cubes?

477
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Because he found ice cubes at 9:55.

478
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,120
Who would make ice cubes in advance?

479
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,240
It must be because their artist likes to drink cold beverages.

480
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
Yes, that's right.

481
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,800
They do it all the time.

482
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,200
Yes.

483
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,040
Okay.

484
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Okay.

485
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,480
We've identified the culprit.

486
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
Keep searching.

487
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,520
Let's go.

488
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
There's someone outside.

489
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,880
Hello.

490
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Hello.

491
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,480
Wait, I've seen you before.

492
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
Aren't you...

493
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,600
Pa Mei

494
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,520
Pa Mei, right?

495
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,640
She comes every season.

496
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,560
Yes.

497
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
There's no one else here.

498
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,840
Did you come here to...

499
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,800
We're fine.

500
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,400
We're just looking around.

501
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,840
We're just taking a walk.

502
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Just now, your boss died.

503
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
We came over.

504
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,600
The boss's death is a secret.

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,440
What?

506
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,840
No.

507
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,120
No.

508
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,400
We said—

509
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,120
I said, we really are—

510
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,560
I said, we really are—

511
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,560
What?

512
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,600
No, not the boss.

513
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,760
The boss is really awful.

514
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,160
The boss is truly terrible.

515
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Really annoying.

516
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
He stood us up today.

517
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah.

518
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,080
So, you guys—

519
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,720
Have you been cleaning here all day?

520
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,480
Yes.

521
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Then did you see this morning—

522
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
Sorry, one moment.

523
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,160
I hear you, go ahead.

524
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,520
Where did the printer go?

525
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Where did the printer go?

526
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,520
The printer.

527
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,200
It was taken away.

528
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,840
Didn't you just say the printer was broken?

529
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,960
I'll have someone fix it later.

530
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,480
There are still a lot of confidential files cached inside.

531
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,640
They haven't been completely deleted.

532
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Hurry and bring it back.

533
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Hurry, no one else can see it.

534
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
The confidential information inside.

535
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,240
It's all top secret.

536
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
Okay, got it.

537
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Saying secrets out loud.

538
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,400
We won't look.

539
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Where is the printer usually kept?

540
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,880
I need to look for the printer too.

541
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
But I can't go right now.

542
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,080
Because I have other things to do.

543
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,280
It's fine, we can help you.

544
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,200
That's right.

545
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,440
There are just two calls to make.

546
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,600
Can you help me with them?

547
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,200
No problem.

548
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,600
Sure.

549
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
One is to the screenwriter.

550
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
To discuss the script requirements.

551
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,080
The other is with the partner company.

552
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,720
To discuss the cooperation needs.

553
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,600
Just these two calls.

554
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,520
If you can make them for me,

555
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,680
I'd really appreciate it.

556
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,000
Where are the phone numbers?

557
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,440
I have the phone numbers.

558
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,480
I can take you to my desk to make the calls.

559
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,840
Okay.

560
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,320
Let's go to the desk.

561
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,520
Come on.

562
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,800
Come on, let's go, you lead the way.

563
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I want to learn how to whistle too.

564
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,680
How do you do it?

565
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,880
You can't even whistle?

566
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
What are you two talking about?

567
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Why do you care what we're talking about?

568
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,200
Just check it a bit.

569
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
The communication between the killer and X.

570
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,320
Be careful, you two.

571
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Why do you care what we're talking about?

572
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,880
Ning, if you don't explain properly,

573
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,040
you're really in trouble this time.

574
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
Back again.

575
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
Okay.

576
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
Are you going to set a fire again?

577
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
Keep your voice down.

578
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,760
Alright.

579
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,840
Okay.

580
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,720
Quiet.

581
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,240
This call...

582
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Who's calling again?

583
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,320
This call...

584
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,880
I'll head out first, then.

585
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,800
Everyone, actors,

586
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,840
I still have to go clean up.

587
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,520
Okay, bye.

588
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,520
157

589
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,160
Hello.

590
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Why can't I understand this?

591
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
Is she a screenwriter or in legal?

592
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:06,920
She is

593
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,960
a screenwriter.

594
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,160
Is the second sister from Legal here?

595
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,720
Are any colleagues from Legal here?

596
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,560
Such an indifferent workplace.

597
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,200
That's just how the workplace is.

598
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,960
Come over here and talk.

599
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,360
Don't disturb their work.

600
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,400
Come over here and talk.

601
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Don't disturb their work.

602
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,960
Are you from Legal?

603
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
Yes, I'm from Legal.

604
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,360
The screenwriter mainly thinks that

605
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
there's a problem with a script?

606
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,000
"The CEO Fell in Love with Me."

607
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
But our company doesn't have that script.

608
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,680
We don't have that script.

609
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Right.

610
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,600
As for our company's scripts,

611
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm very clear about all of them.

612
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Maybe you should double-check

613
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,200
what the script is actually called.

614
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,600
Listen.

615
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,960
The CEO Falls in Love with Me

616
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,440
But it seems like a hallucination before mushroom poisoning

617
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
There really is such a script

618
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
Come over here and talk

619
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,880
This nitpicking legal department

620
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
The CEO Falls in Love with Me

621
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
But it seems like a hallucination before eating mushrooms

622
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,040
What you just mentioned is indeed

623
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,240
Our company does have this script

624
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,160
But this script

625
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,880
What exactly is the problem with it?

626
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,080
Within five minutes

627
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,880
I want all the information about this girl

628
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Is there a problem with this sentence?

629
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,840
This content

630
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
It does indeed violate

631
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,680
Our Civil Code's

632
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,080
Article 111

633
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,560
While ensuring creative freedom

634
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,720
We must ensure

635
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,360
The script is legal and compliant

636
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,480
This is also out of our respect for the script

637
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,080
Respect

638
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,440
Yes

639
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
That's right

640
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,040
All work proceeds as planned

641
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,440
That is my J-person goal

642
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,840
I will protect the working state

643
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,440
You should have a bottle too

644
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,800
Alright, with the protection of J-person

645
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,360
My potential will surely become

646
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,680
a hexagonal warrior

647
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,240
Multiple personas, unique personalities on display

648
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
Enjoy the "Coca-Cola" sharing bottle

649
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,880
Let's have fun together

650
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
If you have any issues going forward,

651
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,760
such as legal problems,

652
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,360
you can also contact me.

653
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,240
Here is my business card.

654
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Alright.

655
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,600
I still have some things to take care of.

656
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,360
I'll head out now.

657
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,080
Okay.

658
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,400
Thank you.

659
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,040
Alright.

660
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,080
Now we need to make the next call.

661
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,680
Yes.

662
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay, I just called.

663
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,160
Hello.

664
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,920
That's basically the situation.

665
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,680
But the specifics will depend on the circumstances.

666
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,640
This is Xiao Li from Short Video Co., Ltd.

667
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm helping my Thai boss

668
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,200
pass a message to your PR department's Brother Cheng.

669
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
Just a quick message.

670
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,240
Also, please help my Russian colleague

671
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,880
pass a message to Director Pan of the Agency Department.

672
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,440
German, French.

673
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,760
Russian.

674
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,600
Do you speak Russian?

675
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,160
I don't understand.

676
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
I didn't understand either.

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,800
But with this pronunciation, they'll understand.

678
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,680
Excuse me,

679
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
I only remembered "sawasdee ka."

680
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
What comes after that?

681
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
Play it again.

682
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,200
Wait a moment.

683
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
Let's divide the work for this round first.

684
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,560
Actually, we only need to remember two parts.

685
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,480
So there are six of us in total.

686
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,680
Three of us will remember the Thai part.

687
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,760
And three will remember the Russian part, okay?

688
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,200
No.

689
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,640
We can't even remember a single section.

690
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Let's memorize the Thai first.

691
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Let's memorize the Thai first.

692
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,360
We have to do it this way.

693
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,360
I'll remember the next line.

694
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Then you remember after that.

695
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,480
No.

696
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,680
I can't remember even one or two lines.

697
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
Let's do it line by line.

698
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,320
That works too.

699
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,000
Okay, let's go.

700
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,440
Dial.

701
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,080
Dialed.

702
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,760
Okay, it's done.

703
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,240
Cheng.

704
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,640
What Cheng means is...

705
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,600
You guys can actually understand?

706
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,120
She—do you know Thai?

707
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,280
You watch Thai dramas, right?

708
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320
A little.

709
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,480
No.

710
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
What she's speaking now is...

711
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
Is it Thai-accented Chinese or Thai?

712
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,400
Thai.

713
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
Proper, pure Thai.

714
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,400
See, she's translated it all for you.

715
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,080
How can you all understand this?

716
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Seriously...

717
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm totally lost, what is this?

718
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,360
I only heard...

719
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
The next line.

720
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
Seems like this line...

721
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,600
It doesn't mean "are you doing well," right?

722
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I don't understand this line.

723
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,040
She understands, she got it.

724
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,400
Come on, let's do it again.

725
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,440
We need to listen to it again.

726
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,840
Okay.

727
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes.

728
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,880
Let's leave it at that.

729
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,600
Yes, that's it.

730
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
There's also a Russian one.

731
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,560
There's also Russian.

732
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
Khorosho.

733
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Khorosho.

734
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
Khorosho.

735
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,280
Khorosho is the only Russian word I know.

736
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,840
Leitinggaba.

737
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,200
Lei.

738
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,040
Play the Russian one.

739
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,560
Go ahead.

740
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,400
You guys are amazing.

741
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
I can't hear any of them.

742
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,760
Phone.

743
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,680
There's also "shift."

744
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Shift.

745
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,400
I heard this one, you listen again.

746
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,720
You listen.

747
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,680
That's all.

748
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,040
That's all.

749
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,360
That's all. Okay.

750
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,720
Come on.

751
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Let's go.

752
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,720
Let's go.

753
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Cheng, are you there?

754
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Over here, over here.

755
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,600
Outside.

756
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,480
Someone called from outside.

757
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,280
Let's go.

758
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,360
Cheng.

759
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Here, we're here.

760
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,480
Inside, inside.

761
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,000
Hello.

762
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,640
Is there something you need?

763
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,040
We need to convey some meeting details.

764
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Meeting details.

765
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,040
Wait a moment.

766
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,800
Wait a moment.

767
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,600
Who is looking for me?

768
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm looking for you.

769
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,840
No, not me.

770
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,400
It's the boss from the partner company.

771
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,280
That one.

772
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,680
Xiao Li.

773
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,080
That's right.

774
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,160
Then go ahead.

775
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,840
You understood, right?

776
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
I kind of...

777
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
I kind of don't understand.

778
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,640
Then that's definitely your problem.

779
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
Ours is very standard.

780
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,680
So you don't understand Thai.

781
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Right.

782
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
There's nothing wrong with how we repeated it.

783
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,560
The sense of the language is correct.

784
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,240
I kind of understood.

785
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,800
The meaning in Chinese is

786
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,840
Dear Cheng, I miss you.

787
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,880
Actually, it's nothing important.

788
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,800
I just wanted to ask when you have time.

789
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,480
To meet again.

790
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,000
So romantic.

791
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Who is she?

792
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,560
She is...

793
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,160
Mind your own business.

794
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,600
None of your business.

795
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,200
Okay, then let's find another one.

796
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,120
He's Cheng.

797
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,440
And there's that other woman, what's her name...

798
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Sister Pan.

799
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,760
Director Pan.

800
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
She should be in the underground parking lot.

801
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,360
You can go take a look.

802
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Goodbye.

803
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,760
Goodbye.

804
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,080
Goodbye.

805
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,760
There's a car here.

806
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,440
This should be the one.

807
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,400
This must be the boss's car.

808
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's find Director Pan first.

809
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,040
Director Pan.

810
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,760
Director Pan.

811
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,520
Who's talking?

812
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
This...

813
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm talking.

814
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,520
Are you Director Pan?

815
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,760
What do you need from me?

816
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Yes, I have a message for you.

817
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,240
A Russian friend of yours...

818
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,280
The one who just spoke Russian.

819
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,920
You do it.

820
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
Go ahead.

821
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
You do it, you useless thing.

822
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,680
Please.

823
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,880
And then...

824
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,920
Wait a moment.

825
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,400
There's a string of numbers after this.

826
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,720
Right.

827
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,240
Got it.

828
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,120
So I'm supposed to make a call, right?

829
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes.

830
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I'll call him.

831
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,360
Okay.

832
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
We need to find that girl again.

833
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Let's go, then.

834
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,560
Let's check the car first.

835
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,920
Aren't the car keys here too?

836
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,760
Let's just go.

837
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,560
Where to?

838
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,320
Drive away.

839
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
Found you.

840
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,680
Coming.

841
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,200
Coming.

842
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,280
Did you make my call?

843
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,240
It's done.

844
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,360
Thanks, sis.

845
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,600
This is truly heart for heart.

846
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,160
What's this?

847
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,360
The printer you wanted.

848
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,840
Where is it?

849
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,160
Where is it?

850
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,040
It's here.

851
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,720
In the discarded items area.

852
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,200
You know too.

853
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
There are some confidential files inside.

854
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
We won't look at them.

855
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,360
Thank you.

856
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,200
Thank you.

857
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
You've helped so much.

858
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
I'll get back to work.

859
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,480
Okay.

860
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,080
Alright, thanks.

861
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
Printer.

862
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
Let's assemble it.

863
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,840
The fake poison can't be unsealed.

864
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,160
Online payment.

865
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,440
Delivered on April 22nd.

866
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,280
So he just bought this poison.

867
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,880
What time?

868
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
No time listed.

869
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,640
But there's a phone number.

870
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,320
We can call it.

871
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, keep this.

872
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,440
Going up to make a call.

873
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,920
Making another call.

874
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,600
Why does it feel so heavy?

875
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,120
AI voice synthesizer.

876
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,040
After entering the text,

877
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,160
Can randomly generate human voices (audio)

878
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
and play them back.

879
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
What is this? What is it?

880
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,440
There's a recording.

881
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,480
As long as the secret you have is explosive enough,

882
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,320
you'll definitely be able to sign the contract.

883
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,160
You could have them under your control for life.

884
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
So that information is fake.

885
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,440
Billion-dollar director

886
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,840
The contract you asked me to prepare

887
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,480
has already been placed in the office.

888
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,880
The killer did it.

889
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's AI-generated.

890
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,360
The killer used AI to generate it.

891
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,480
I think maybe they didn't want him to recognize

892
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,000
which boy's voice it was.

893
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's possible too, but it's just voice-changing.

894
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,520
Right, it's voice-altered.

895
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,680
Then tricked him into that (room).

896
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,800
There's a print record here.

897
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,960
April 22nd, 9:45 AM

898
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,000
From this printer

899
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,240
a document was printed.

900
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,760
Can this tell us

901
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,920
everyone's identity?

902
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,960
You can access the printer's history cache.

903
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,360
Scroll to the second page.

904
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,320
Select the USB drive one.

905
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,560
Select this USB drive.

906
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,520
Storage device.

907
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,200
What about this one?

908
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,640
Deadly Ghost

909
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,040
Click this, click on this.

910
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,440
He typed it.

911
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,080
Infatuated Ghost, Cowardly Ghost

912
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,000
Playboy Ghost, Painted Skin Ghost

913
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Traitor, Accomplice

914
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
This one doesn't have the Killer.

915
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,240
That's how it is now.

916
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,520
Coward, Playboy

917
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,360
Impostor, Traitor

918
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,079
Accomplice

919
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,720
We've seen all five of these.

920
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,200
Only the Devoted one,

921
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,039
we haven't seen.

922
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,320
Why?

923
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,599
There's no Killer.

924
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,720
What's wrong?

925
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,480
What?

926
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,119
The original image was the Devoted one.

927
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,200
Coward

928
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,680
Playboy, Impostor

929
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
Traitor and Accomplice

930
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,960
Actually, it should show six cards here.

931
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,280
And this one,

932
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,800
At the forty-five minute mark, only one was played.

933
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,320
The Killer was played separately.

934
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,760
Is there anything else?

935
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,079
Did something fall out of the trash bag?

936
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,880
Here.

937
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,840
What is this?

938
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,480
No, what is this?

939
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,960
There's only this paper with "痴心鬼" on it.

940
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,760
We haven't seen it before.

941
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,520
Didn't you just see this?

942
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

943
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,800
It's so big.

944
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Maybe it was taken out like this just now.

945
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
We didn't see it.

946
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,400
Then this pile isn't mine.

947
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,880
Not me.

948
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,200
This pile is from that...

949
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,400
痴心鬼.

950
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,160
痴心鬼.

951
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,640
痴心鬼.

952
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
So he threw it away in the office.

953
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,760
He was in the office.

954
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Someone used the entry for 夺命鬼.

955
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,760
And replaced it with 痴心鬼.

956
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,440
Right.

957
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,760
And it was in the office area.

958
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,680
He was in the office.

959
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,480
Wait, this person is the culprit.

960
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,760
Right?

961
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,120
We can admit that now.

962
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,160
The one who switched this is the culprit.

963
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
The one who switched it should be, I think...

964
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,800
Why do you think

965
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
the person who changed this is the culprit?

966
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,720
Then who would come to change it?

967
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,760
The boss or the staff.

968
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,080
Why would he do this?

969
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,880
They found out that this infatuated person

970
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,680
is actually the culprit.

971
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,240
The one who really caused the death

972
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,160
of his friend.

973
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,640
So they changed it to "killer ghost."

974
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,960
What clue led you to this conclusion?

975
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,320
Because isn't it written on there?

976
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,600
It says, "I know one of them"

977
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,880
is the one who really killed his friend.

978
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
Are you saying that in this whole incident,

979
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,280
there is still another outsider involved?

980
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,080
I think that logic is possible.

981
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,720
Why can't there be?

982
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,880
Actually, this makes sense.

983
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,960
Let's take a look at this.

984
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
Actually, it's related to that name.

985
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,200
What is it?

986
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,080
What is this? This is a...

987
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Each ghost has its own story.

988
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
Coward.

989
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,120
I heard one today.

990
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
A story about a coward.

991
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,120
In a moment of danger, he chose to run away.

992
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,320
He let his friend bear all the disaster.

993
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,560
I think it's him.

994
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,440
I think it fits me.

995
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,920
It actually sounds a lot like me.

996
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,120
You kind of count too.

997
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,920
Why?

998
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
I called you to come save me.

999
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,200
But you didn't come either.

1000
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,960
We're both cowards when it comes to feelings.

1001
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,640
What ghost?

1002
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
Coward.

1003
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
There's also a "Chang Gui".

1004
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,360
In the story, there's a "Chang Gui".

1005
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,640
Whenever there's danger, he always gets away unharmed.

1006
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,240
He only stands in safe places.

1007
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
He quietly watches as his friends, trusting him,

1008
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,560
step into danger.

1009
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,480
You.

1010
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
From that day on,

1011
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
he always felt

1012
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,800
someone was behind him.

1013
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,120
Was it you?

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,480
Playboy

1015
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,400
There's a playboy in Tuiyi.

1016
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,120
When he says he loves you, his eyes light up.

1017
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,200
His voice is gentle.

1018
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,920
Some people believed him.

1019
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,680
Some people cried.

1020
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,640
Some people went crazy.

1021
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,800
Devoted fool

1022
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,240
It's said there's a devoted fool in Tuiyi.

1023
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,440
He loves someone deeply.

1024
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,960
He paved every path for that person.

1025
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,160
He cut off all possible ways out.

1026
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,320
He gently says, "Don't be afraid."

1027
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
"I'll always be with you."

1028
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,160
He's afraid that person will run away.

1029
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,400
His door always opens in the middle of the night.

1030
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
There's a faintly familiar scent in the air.

1031
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,240
Only then can he feel at ease.

1032
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,840
That's him, the devoted fool.

1033
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,480
That's you.

1034
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,120
You won't stay away from me because of this, will you?

1035
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,160
Just kidding.

1036
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,480
"Mask-wearer"

1037
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,400
Rumor has it there's a mask-wearer.

1038
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,880
He wears a mask and deceives his opponents.

1039
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
That's me.

1040
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Mole

1041
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,320
It's said there's a terrifying mole.

1042
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
No need to say it, that's X.

1043
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,240
It's him.

1044
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes.

1045
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,080
That's him.

1046
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,440
Who were the three before her?

1047
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,760
The three before?

1048
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,880
Actually, they're all quite similar.

1049
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,080
I want to ask you a question.

1050
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,440
Did you really fall in love with her later?

1051
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,040
You keep asking irrelevant questions now.

1052
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,760
Because I want to know.

1053
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,920
Is he hopelessly devoted?

1054
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,800
Because maybe he did it to get back at me.

1055
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,640
Then he's devoted to you.

1056
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,680
No, if anyone's devoted, he's even more so.

1057
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
It's obvious devotion.

1058
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
Did you fall for her or not?

1059
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,360
I li—

1060
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,720
I didn't.

1061
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,200
Actually, I didn't really like her that much.

1062
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,040
Happy now?

1063
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,720
Then who is the person in your heart?

1064
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,080
Because I dated a few others after that.

1065
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,720
I really didn't tell you about this.

1066
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,200
He kept it from you.

1067
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,880
No.

1068
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,040
Because I didn't think it was necessary to tell you.

1069
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,200
Because what happens between us

1070
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,360
is just between the two of us.

1071
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,400
But yes, I admit it.

1072
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,840
Fine, you two keep going over your morals.

1073
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Let's discuss morals later.

1074
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,080
You're saying that in this whole incident,

1075
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,600
there's still another outside helper involved.

1076
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Someone used the "Doom Ghost" entry

1077
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,360
and swapped it with the "Devoted Ghost."

1078
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,120
It must be that the boss found out

1079
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,200
which one was the harmful one.

1080
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,160
He took the "Doom Ghost"

1081
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,280
and replaced the "Devoted Ghost" with it.

1082
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,160
So he concluded

1083
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,400
that it was the "Devoted Ghost" who killed.

1084
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Right.

1085
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,480
Yeah.

1086
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,320
Anyway, this "Doom Ghost"—

1087
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,080
As long as you confirm the "Doom Ghost"

1088
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,960
was swapped with the "Devoted Ghost," right?

1089
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,440
Of course.

1090
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Then among the four of us,

1091
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,920
who is most likely the "Devoted Ghost"?

1092
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,600
Only him.

1093
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,680
Then it's locked in.

1094
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,360
Impossible.

1095
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,600
It's locked.

1096
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,320
Locked in, it's him.

1097
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,760
Then let's vote.

1098
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,560
Locked, okay.

1099
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,680
If you do it this way, I can't accept it.

1100
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,240
I'm telling you,

1101
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,000
if you do this, I won't accept it.

1102
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,880
Yeah, how is that possible?

1103
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,720
I can't accept it.

1104
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,120
Is there only one notebook in the car?

1105
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,280
There's also this one.

1106
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,960
What's this?

1107
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,200
Explosion record of the neighboring factory.

1108
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,880
What is this?

1109
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,160
I don't understand it.

1110
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Eyewitness account of the neighboring factory explosion.

1111
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,720
On the night of February 26, 2025,

1112
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,800
an explosion occurred at the neighboring Tuitian Food Factory.

1113
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,480
According to the boss Tui Baiyi's instructions,

1114
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,120
we went to the neighboring factory to patrol and investigate.

1115
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,760
Seven bodies were removed from the factory.

1116
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,200
Their identities were confirmed as

1117
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Tan Qian, owner of Tuitian Food Factory,

1118
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,880
and six employees.

1119
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,240
Outsourced electrician Ning Dengpao, 24 years old,

1120
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,280
was actually

1121
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,360
the real boss behind Tuitian Food Factory.

1122
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,040
Factory welder Bai Hanzi, 25 years old,

1123
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,640
falsified his age due to the factory's age restrictions.

1124
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,320
His real age is 38.

1125
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,720
Cement worker He Niba, 23 years old,

1126
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,520
graduated from Tui City University Business School,

1127
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,760
and was also an underground lottery bookie in Tui Lottery.

1128
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,320
Packer Ba Fentang, 20 years old,

1129
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,880
is the younger sister of internet celebrity Quán Táng.

1130
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,720
Cafeteria chef Jin Tangshao, 20 years old.

1131
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,160
Security guard Ke Ankan, 22 years old.

1132
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
In this factory,

1133
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,560
except for the chef and the security guard,

1134
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,360
the identities of the others

1135
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
all seem complicated.

1136
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,320
The cleanup of the scene

1137
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,280
by staff continued until the early hours of the next day.

1138
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,880
It was confirmed that there were no other people at the scene.

1139
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,960
No one survived.

1140
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,400
Not a bad location.

1141
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,800
After being abandoned, it could be turned into a film set.

1142
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,240
The site was blown up.

1143
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,120
What could it be?

1144
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,360
The factory area we're in today

1145
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,160
is the place where the explosion happened.

1146
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
What else is here?

1147
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,200
Let's go up and take a closer look.

1148
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,600
Take these with you.

1149
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,800
Let's go, let's head up.

1150
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,040
I'm really stressed out.

1151
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,720
I've been perming and dyeing my hair too much lately.

1152
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm about to meet a client.

1153
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,520
My hair is dry, frizzy, and tangled.

1154
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,400
What should I do when my hair is in such bad shape?

1155
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Don't worry.

1156
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,120
I just happen to have

1157
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,360
Pantene Bubble Capsule Hair Mask

1158
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,880
There's a rose fragrance version

1159
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,800
and a collagen version.

1160
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,880
Pick one and give it a try.

1161
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,080
Then I'll try

1162
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,280
the collagen version.

1163
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,160
Okay.

1164
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,040
This Pantene Collagen Bubble Capsule Hair Mask

1165
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,320
contains little

1166
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,680
high-concentration essence microbeads

1167
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,440
combined with a collagen formula

1168
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,120
that deeply repairs the hair from within

1169
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,320
making your hair resilient and shiny.

1170
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,480
Look, your hair quality is getting better and better.

1171
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,800
The improvement is really noticeable.

1172
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,040
Now go to Tmall 618.

1173
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,640
Search for "0.01 get Pantene".

1174
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,200
You have a chance to get it for just one cent.

1175

And receive the Pantene Bubble Hair Mask.

1176
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,880
Remember to stock up and keep using it.

1177
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,120
Your hair will keep getting better.

1178
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,200
Seeing you, I think you've become much more handsome.

1179
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,160
In my eyes, he's always been very handsome.

1180
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,520
Okay.

1181
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,720
I'll keep you in my heart.

1182
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
You put me...

1183
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,560
You put me under your shoe.

1184
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,600
Okay.

1185
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,360
It's time to start identifying the culprit.

1186
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,760
Okay.

1187
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,000
Sitting down feels so comfortable.

1188
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,400
It really, really feels comfortable.

1189
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,400
Should we call the delivery guy?

1190
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,520
Yes.

1191
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,960
Yes.

1192
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,360
What are you going to ask him?

1193
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
Ask him what time.

1194
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,120
Right, what time the delivery arrived.

1195
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,040
Who ordered the delivery?

1196
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,440
One eight eight.

1197
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,480
Hello.

1198
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,520
Hello.

1199
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,680
Hello.

1200
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,160
This is the online store that sells everything.

1201
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,000
No matter what you buy,

1202
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,520
I can deliver it to your door.

1203
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,800
May I ask what you need?

1204
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,760
You say you are a customer.

1205
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,040
I placed an order today.

1206
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,720
Zundujiadu and Bukekaijiao.

1207
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,480
But I still haven't received it.

1208
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,200
I want to ask what time you delivered it.

1209
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,520
Where was it delivered?

1210
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,560
Why are you calling to ask again?

1211
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,120
This is the third call I've received today.

1212
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,440
Someone already called to ask.

1213
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
Someone called this morning to buy it.

1214
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,240
Then someone else called to ask about the properties of the drug.

1215
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,960
Is it a lethal poison?

1216
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,240
I said this poison kills instantly upon contact with blood.

1217
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,320
And now you’re calling me again.

1218
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,520
No, who made the first two calls?

1219
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,960
Maybe someone else picked up my delivery.

1220
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,720
This concerns our users’ privacy.

1221
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,520
I can’t tell you.

1222
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,320
But

1223
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,360
if you want to use Zundujiadu,

1224
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,760
be aware that this poison kills instantly upon contact with blood.

1225
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,040
It will cause immediate death.

1226
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,640
But this poison must be stored in a sealed container.

1227
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,720
After three hours of exposure to air, it will turn black.

1228
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,560
Okay, got it.

1229
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,360
Is there anything else?

1230
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,160
Alright, goodbye.

1231
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,200
He said someone called to buy it.

1232
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,560
And another person called to ask.

1233
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,520
If it’s a lethal poison.

1234
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,560
We’re the third group calling to ask who bought it.

1235
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,520
Then there's no need to know who the second person is.

1236
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,400
Because the second person

1237
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,200
definitely isn't the killer.

1238
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,760
No, I think there might be some connection.

1239
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,600
It's possible that it's the killer himself.

1240
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,880
He might be checking

1241
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,280
if any of his information is revealed.

1242
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,320
Right, to see if his information is revealed.

1243
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,240
But he found out they wouldn't say anything.

1244
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,840
Okay, then he felt relieved.

1245
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,560
Killers often return to the scene of the crime.

1246
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,760
That's possible too.

1247
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,720
And repeatedly check

1248
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,440
their own tools, right?

1249
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Could it be that the boss bought it to commit murder?

1250
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,640
Then the killer found out about it.

1251
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,960
He knew the boss wanted to kill him and planned to strike back.

1252
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,840
Right, so he asked

1253
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,280
how to use this drug.

1254
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,840
Honestly, I think

1255
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,920
that's unlikely.

1256
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,960
Why is it unlikely?

1257
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Think about today's case, for example.

1258
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,120
The logic behind the murder.

1259
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,280
The whole thing,

1260
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,320
first you have to know

1261
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,360
how you want to kill this person.

1262
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,960
Only then would you buy those two items.

1263
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,760
Right?

1264
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,840
This method,

1265
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,760
the boss and the person trying to kill him in return

1266
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,240
would never coordinate with each other.

1267
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,160
It's hard to imagine these two people

1268
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,040
coming up with exactly the same method

1269
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,680
to kill someone.

1270
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,480
And buying exactly the same items.

1271
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,320
That's the meaning of the second call.

1272
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,560
What is it?

1273
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,800
The first one buys.

1274
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,760
The second one asks.

1275
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,120
It's about gathering information.

1276
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,520
The one who's always digging for gossip.

1277
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:13,960
Computer.

1278
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,720
Early retirement.

1279
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,600
That one just now.

1280
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,480
Who is the alt account?

1281
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,400
What did they talk to you about?

1282
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,000
Who is Early Retirement?

1283
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,120
On the computer.

1284
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,600
There are chat logs about gathering information.

1285
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,800
That alt account.

1286
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,600
It's on his account

1287
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,200
There are three people

1288
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,520
The first appearance

1289
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,360
was at 9:30

1290
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,600
in a group chat

1291
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,320
This alt account asked

1292
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,720
the informant

1293
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
about the boss's working hours

1294
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,320
The informant replied in a private chat

1295
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Then when the two were chatting privately at 9:32

1296
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,600
he asked about the character card

1297
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,240
Then the informant told him

1298
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,440
the character card is in the boss's office

1299
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,240
No one will be watching it before 10 o'clock

1300
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,120
That's the situation

1301
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,440
He said, then I'll go in twenty minutes

1302
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,760
which is at 9:52

1303
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,720
to check the character card

1304
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,800
to see if there's enough time

1305
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,520
Next

1306
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
at 9:35

1307
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,720
the third person appeared

1308
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,640
This person could possibly be

1309
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,640
the alt account

1310
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,760
These two might be the same person

1311
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,600
I don't think it's the alt account himself

1312
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,440
This is the same as ordering takeout by phone.

1313
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,480
The method is exactly the same.

1314
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,960
And we saw that the identity role card

1315
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,520
had been changed.

1316
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,280
So it could be

1317
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,080
leaving work early.

1318
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,880
Leaving work early.

1319
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,680
Retirement.

1320
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,000
Right.

1321
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,560
Early retirement.

1322
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
The mind has already entered

1323
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,400
a state of being off work.

1324
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,600
So it could be that early retirement.

1325
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,240
Knowing that the person before

1326
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,560
was going to check the role card,

1327
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,320
they went ahead in advance

1328
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,240
and swapped out the role card.

1329
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,920
Here's what we'll do.

1330
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,360
We'll call this person "Alt Account," right?

1331
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,760
We'll call this person "Inquirer."

1332
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,680
Is that okay?

1333
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,040
Okay.

1334
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,960
So, "Alt Account."

1335
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,040
There's an "Inquirer."

1336
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,640
Right?

1337
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,160
Right.

1338
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,240
There's something else strange.

1339
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,800
About that delivery order just now,

1340
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,720
someone bought medicine.

1341
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
There was also an "Inquirer."

1342
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
Someone just called to buy it.

1343
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,520
Then someone else called to ask about it.

1344
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,680
I think these two are probably the same person.

1345
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,720
I think the "Inquirer"

1346
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,760
should be the same person.

1347
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,120
The Inquirer's account

1348
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,400
is called "Early Retirement," right?

1349
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,240
So now,

1350
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,120
let's not use "Early Retirement."

1351
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,400
Let's just call them "Inquirer."

1352
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,080
Okay.

1353
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,360
Alright, these two are clear now.

1354
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,240
Go on.

1355
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,640
I just think

1356
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,880
So,

1357
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,440
Right.

1358
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,440
Right.

1359
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,280
He (the Prince) said to retire early.

1360
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,000
It could be the second person who called.

1361
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,640
Let's call him the inquirer.

1362
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,320
The inquirer is

1363
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,400
possibly the one who switched the tag.

1364
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,600
The inquirer must be

1365
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,400
the one who switched the tag.

1366
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,080
Right.

1367
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,440
So the inquirer found out.

1368
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,360
The alternate account.

1369
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,880
Why did he inquire about the alternate account?

1370
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,160
Right.

1371
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,520
Right.

1372
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,480
Then he went and switched this

1373
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:08,920
tag.

1374
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,200
Tag.

1375
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,640
Right before the alternate account

1376
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,240
took action,

1377
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,400
he switched the tag.

1378
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,480
Can I use an analogy?

1379
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,120
Use people as an analogy.

1380
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,720
For example,

1381
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,520
Ba thinks I killed her friend.

1382
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,160
So I am the person with the alternate account.

1383
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,560
I said something in that company

1384
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,880
about the boss.

1385
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
Then Ba kept inquiring about me.

1386
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,440
Because she knows

1387
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,640
I killed her friend.

1388
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,760
Right.

1389
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,040
Isn't that so?

1390
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,280
Right.

1391
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,120
So she (Ba) knows

1392
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,320
that after I inquired about the boss,

1393
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,760
she (Ba) went to the office

1394
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,560
and switched the ghost that belonged to me

1395
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,720
to the deadly ghost.

1396
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,200
Right.

1397
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,800
What does she (Ba) want to do?

1398
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,960
She (Ba Mian Linglong) wants you to

1399
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,600
wants you to kill someone.

1400
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,920
So she (Ba Mian Linglong) switched yours in advance

1401
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
and replaced it with the Death Ghost.

1402
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,320
Then when you go to the office and see it,

1403
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
you wonder, "Why am I the Death Ghost?"

1404
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,000
And it even says on it

1405
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,920
But among them,

1406
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,240
the one who caused their friend's death

1407
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,560
is completely under my control.

1408
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:03,960
Right.

1409
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,320
You have a perfect motive

1410
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,440
to go and kill someone immediately.

1411
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,080
So basically, this is killing with a borrowed knife.

1412
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,080
Exactly.

1413
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,640
No, not saying it's you.

1414
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:17,920
No.

1415
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,680
I know she (Jin Zi Zhaopai)

1416
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,760
knows about this?

1417
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,560
You don't know.

1418
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,640
For example,

1419
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,720
I want to ask,

1420
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,160
does she (Ba Mian Linglong) want to kill the boss

1421
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,640
or avenge her friend?

1422
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,240
Maybe it's killing two birds with one stone.

1423
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,680
It just so happens that among us,

1424
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,120
you accidentally killed my friend before.

1425
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,360
I can take care of both of you at once.

1426
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,280
Let you kill him.

1427
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,520
So,

1428
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,920
she lets the person she hates

1429
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,640
kill the boss first.

1430
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,080
In the end, I get arrested and go to jail.

1431
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,760
You get the boss killed,

1432
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,800
and also let

1433
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,240
the person who killed your friend die.

1434
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,120
That's truly killing two birds with one stone.

1435
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,440
He seems like the kind of person who, when playing Go,

1436
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,960
So now it proves

1437
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,440
if it's this inquirer

1438
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,520
who only prompted the "small account" to go

1439
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,080
and kill the boss,

1440
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,160
then this inquirer

1441
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
can step forward now,

1442
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,320
and tell us

1443
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,800
No.

1444
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,160
No.

1445
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,640
These two murderers could be

1446
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,720
The logic of this murderer is

1447
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,040
the person who actually did it is the murderer,

1448
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,720
or is it

1449
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,560
the one who directly caused the death is the murderer?

1450
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:40,960
I have a question.

1451
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,240
Go ahead.

1452
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,600
If we follow this logic,

1453
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,000
what if I found someone really stupid

1454
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,960
and I have to teach you how to do it?

1455
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,760
So there is one person

1456
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,880
who instigates another

1457
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,920
on how to kill someone.

1458
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,080
If I instigate you,

1459
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,400
am I not considered a murderer?

1460
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,440
Why is it only the one who directly caused the death

1461
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,360
who is considered the murderer?

1462
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,040
I think your logic is too weak.

1463
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,720
If you want to determine

1464
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,760
that there are two people involved,

1465
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,200
you can't just say the one who caused the death

1466
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,040
is the only murderer.

1467
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,960
It has to be both people.

1468
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,760
This is a legal issue

1469
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,080
and a moral issue.

1470
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,960
Instigating murder

1471
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,920
is still murder, isn't it?

1472
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,160
Good point, detective.

1473
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,120
Why are you so concerned about joint liability?

1474
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,720
Are you the one who instigated it?

1475
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:25,880
Let me tell you.

1476
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,520
Why I care so much about this matter.

1477
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,960
Because just now he (Prince Charming) said,

1478
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
that this instigator doesn't need to take any responsibility.

1479
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,920
That statement made me very dissatisfied.

1480
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,760
This is a legal issue.

1481
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,080
It's also a moral issue.

1482
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,800
Yes, I think he (Prince Charming) is protecting—

1483
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,320
Right.

1484
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,080
—protecting the instigator.

1485
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
I'm not satisfied with this viewpoint.

1486
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,960
That's why I've been insisting on this point.

1487
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,280
Let me consult about a legal issue.

1488
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,400
Instructing someone else to commit murder,

1489
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,000
does that count as being a murderer?

1490
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,120
Is there legal responsibility for that?

1491
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,000
That's right.

1492
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,360
That's right.

1493
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,560
Hello, is this Sister Le?

1494
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,360
Yes, it's me. What's up?

1495
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:53,800
Sister Le,

1496
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,080
I want to ask you about a legal matter.

1497
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,680
Here's the situation.

1498
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,360
For example, I have a friend

1499
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,520
who wants to kill someone,

1500
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,920
but he doesn't do it himself.

1501
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,680
He incites someone else

1502
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,560
and that person actually kills the victim.

1503
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,640
Would I go to jail too?

1504
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,800
In this situation,

1505
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,920
both of you would be considered as committing intentional homicide.

1506
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,360
By guiding and deceiving,

1507
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,000
you made your friend develop criminal intent

1508
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,840
and actually commit the crime.

1509
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,240
So in this case,

1510
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,200
you are the instigator,

1511
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,440
and your friend is the principal offender.

1512
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,560
There are principal offenders and instigators.

1513
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,240
Right?

1514
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:22,840
That's right.

1515
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,000
Okay.

1516
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Thank you, then.

1517
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,440
Goodbye.

1518
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,480
Okay, goodbye.

1519
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,960
Both people are considered murderers.

1520
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,040
Double culprits.

1521
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,000
It's too hard.

1522
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,240
Then how do we vote on this?

1523
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,720
Okay, let me talk about this.

1524
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,000
Why does the inquirer...

1525
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,120
...want the alt account to investigate?

1526
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,400
Did he pick randomly, or...

1527
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,560
I think he...

1528
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,960
...probably doesn't know who it is.

1529
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,600
Did you look at that chat log?

1530
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,760
The inquirer.

1531
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,200
It's fine, you go first.

1532
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,760
You go ahead.

1533
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,800
Are you showing off your muscles here?

1534
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,680
It itches.

1535
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,840
What?

1536
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,720
You can even make a joke out of this?

1537
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
No, so he kept...

1538
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,800
Yeah, go on.

1539
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,360
You say it, like this.

1540
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,160
You say, "I'll punch you."

1541
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,680
What I'm saying is,

1542
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,600
if he knew

1543
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,760
who this alt account was,

1544
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,280
then he could ask that person,

1545
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,400
just now, you and the alt account...

1546
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,840
...what did the alt account ask about?

1547
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,520
How could he possibly know

1548
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,280
who he is?

1549
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,200
The cause of everything that happened today

1550
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,440
was definitely nine thirty.

1551
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,640
The trumpet.

1552
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,160
The whole thing started

1553
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,480
right at nine thirty.

1554
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,600
At nine thirty, he suddenly saw

1555
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,040
someone asking about the boss.

1556
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,880
He got a bit interested.

1557
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,520
Because lately,

1558
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,200
he's been very interested in killing the boss.

1559
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,240
So when he saw that,

1560
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,360
he thought, "Wow, someone else is asking about him."

1561
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,240
"Alright, let me ask,"

1562
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,320
"what is he asking about?"

1563
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,000
This instigator

1564
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,680
wants to kill the boss.

1565
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,040
That's a given.

1566
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,960
If he didn't want to kill the boss,

1567
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,800
why would he do all this today, right?

1568
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,880
The one asking wants to kill the boss.

1569
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,760
Right.

1570
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,680
Then there's a problem.

1571
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,040
The one asking has, from the very beginning,

1572
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,680
had a grudge against the boss.

1573
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,760
Yes, that's the logic.

1574
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,280
According to your logic,

1575
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,920
he couldn't have just heard the trumpet asking

1576
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,960
about what time the boss comes to work

1577
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,960
and then suddenly

1578
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,880
developed the intent to kill the boss.

1579
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,840
He was already dissatisfied with the boss.

1580
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,400
Right, so what I'm saying is,

1581
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,360
whoever has this kind of relationship

1582
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,560
has wanted to kill the boss for a long time.

1583
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,480
In all the storylines,

1584
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,680
no one has a grudge against the director, right?

1585
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,520
That's right.

1586
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,960
So we can't conclude

1587
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,760
that the inquirer had already

1588
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,720
decided to kill him today.

1589
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,000
Then someone suddenly asked about

1590
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
the boss's schedule.

1591
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,440
I thought for sure he wanted to kill him.

1592
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
So I wanted to use him.

1593
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,240
How could he predict

1594
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,560
that this person wanted to kill him?

1595
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,840
But there's another problem.

1596
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,960
We're all actors.

1597
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,480
We want to be in this director's play.

1598
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:47,960
Right.

1599
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,080
He's not the boss, he's our director.

1600
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,280
The inquirer must know

1601
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,240
who the previous minor role was.

1602
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,760
He has to know

1603
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,760
who this minor role is,

1604
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
so that he can

1605
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,640
swap the killer

1606
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,160
accurately

1607
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,840
with the badge of that minor role.

1608
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,920
Only then can the minor role know

1609
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,920
that they were originally assigned as the killer.

1610
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,160
I must kill this boss.

1611
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,480
So that also means

1612
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,360
this person must know

1613
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,280
who the devoted ghost is.

1614
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,640
Look, this—

1615
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,320
this inquirer—

1616
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,200
Take your time, no rush, we're listening.

1617
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,520
The informant found out about Xiaohao.

1618
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,440
After he was going to the office,

1619
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,840
he wanted Xiaohao to think

1620
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,640
that the boss knew he had killed someone.

1621
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,680
So he wanted to use Xiaohao

1622
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,880
to get rid of the boss.

1623
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,840
So the paper on the boss's desk

1624
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,760
originally had written on it

1625
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,720
who he wanted to assign to which identity.

1626
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,480
The informant went to the office first.

1627
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,960
He had already seen it.

1628
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,480
So he covered it with black ink.

1629
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:47,880
Right.

1630
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,600
Yes.

1631
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,160
So this Xiaohao

1632
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,120
after seeing this thing,

1633
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,160
he realized

1634
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,640
the boss knew I had killed someone.

1635
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,880
That's how it is.

1636
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,280
This is exactly what he wants.

1637
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,800
When the alternate account checked,

1638
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,240
they were hiding something.

1639
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
Yes, that's the logic.

1640
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,000
That inquirer came in

1641
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,200
and just splashed ink on

1642
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,720
the assigned list.

1643
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,240
That's the only thing he did.

1644
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,760
Then he took the sheet he printed himself

1645
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,920
—the one about the Grim Reaper—

1646
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,160
and swapped it into the folder

1647
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,760
he already knew about.

1648
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,640
That's right.

1649
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,480
Let's confirm again,

1650
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,000
the inquirer and this alternate account,

1651
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,680
their relationship is random.

1652
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,200
There's no personal connection.

1653
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,560
No.

1654
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,840
I think these two

1655
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,280
definitely have a connection.

1656
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,040
The premise is, he must know

1657
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,000
that this alternate account has killed someone.

1658
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,240
Because you need to know

1659
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,920
this person has killed someone.

1660
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,360
At the same time, you have a reason to hate this person.

1661
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,640
With this narrowing down,

1662
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,280
it can only be that she (Ba Mian Ling Long) instigated me

1663
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,960
and you (Ning Que Wu Lan) instigated him (Ke Ban Chu Shen).

1664
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,920
These two sets of relationships

1665
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,560
After that, I became more and more confident.

1666
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,080
But then suddenly someone rushed out

1667
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,920
and crashed into us.

1668
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,960
They tricked my friend away.

1669
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,840
Gao Lidi.

1670
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
Unexpectedly, he fell from that mountain

1671
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,480
and accidentally rolled down.

1672
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,960
The one I hit was your friend.

1673
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,120
Right.

1674
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,640
Then his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend

1675
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,720
was accidentally killed by him (Ke Ban Chu Shen).

1676
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,160
A fight broke out.

1677
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,040
It was between my friend and that

1678
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,160
person I was going to scare.

1679
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,400
The two of them fell down.

1680
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,440
That's right.

1681
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,440
I think Ba Mian Linglong

1682
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,840
can be ruled out as a suspect in my opinion.

1683
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,440
Why?

1684
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,720
Because the death of her friend

1685
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,520
has nothing to do with the other three.

1686
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,960
What I mean is,

1687
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,280
the three of you,

1688
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,360
if you hadn't heard Ba Mian Linglong

1689
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,320
tell her own story today,

1690
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,360
you wouldn't have known at all

1691
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:36,880
that she killed someone.

1692
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,920
She was the debt collector.

1693
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,560
She received a text message saying,

1694
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,280
"Your friend fell off the cliff because of you."

1695
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,440
How could the three of you have known

1696
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,480
that she killed someone?

1697
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,440
Those two are so closely connected to you,

1698
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,280
it's entirely possible

1699
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,960
that you know what they did to their friends.

1700
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,000
You know about it.

1701
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,800
One is your best friend,

1702
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,760
the other is your boyfriend.

1703
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,840
How could you not know?

1704
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,040
Actually, it's her (Ba Mian Linglong).

1705
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,320
What happens with her (Ba Mian Linglong) has nothing to do with the three of you.

1706
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,360
It's completely unrelated.

1707
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,960
I really don't know.

1708
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,640
First,

1709
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,680
I've already broken up with him (Ke Ban Chushen).

1710
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,080
I've also fallen out with him (Ning Que Wu Lan).

1711
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,960
Even if I were to instigate him (Ning Que Wu Lan) to kill someone,

1712
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,520
it would be because he (Ning Que Wu Lan) stirred up trouble

1713
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,600
between me and my boyfriend.

1714
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,680
That's my motive.

1715
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,880
I wouldn't, because of him (Ning Que Wu Lan),

1716
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,840
kill his (Ning Que Wu Lan)'s friend or anything like that.

1717
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,840
So you mean

1718
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,600
your relationship with both of them has turned bad.

1719
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:26,920
Yes.

1720
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,120
That makes this even more plausible.

1721
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,040
There's another premise.

1722
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,360
Because the boss knows

1723
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,040
this person's little secret.

1724
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,000
He knows this person killed someone.

1725
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,080
So he can easily control this person.

1726
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,840
Her (Jin Zi Zhaopai)'s chances of being controlled

1727
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,720
are even higher.

1728
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,440
I'm the one being controlled.

1729
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,560
Because you have a direct relationship with the boss.

1730
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,280
It's even more likely.

1731
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,040
How do I have a direct relationship with the boss?

1732
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,440
Because you've worked with the boss many times.

1733
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,840
You're his favored actress.

1734
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,520
I'm the actress he personally chose.

1735
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,400
I've never worked with the boss.

1736
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,000
The boss just picked me.

1737
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,600
The one who often works with him is her (Ba Mian Linglong).

1738
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,280
It's her (Ba Mian Linglong).

1739
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,160
Not often.

1740
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,120
I've only filmed once.

1741
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:07,960
Just these two words.

1742
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,680
Appointed.

1743
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,480
The boss appointed you.

1744
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,880
Shouldn't they give you a contract then?

1745
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,040
Yes.

1746
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,520
Yes.

1747
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,560
Since he appointed you,

1748
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,840
he must have talked to you.

1749
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,680
He didn't talk to me.

1750
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,760
Then how did he appoint you?

1751
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,720
One day, I got a message from the boss saying he really favored me.

1752
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,840
He wanted me to play the female lead.

1753
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,040
That's why I came here today.

1754
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,320
So during this process,

1755
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,680
he gave you a contract.

1756
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,560
I still wasn't sure if I was the female lead.

1757
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,400
We still had to join the training camp.

1758
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,000
He said, "Come join this training camp."

1759
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,800
He gave you special treatment.

1760
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,840
It wasn't special treatment.

1761
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,680
He said, "I want to choose you as the female lead."

1762
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,720
But you must participate.

1763
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,320
In my training camp.

1764
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,240
If I passed, then I could come.

1765
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,680
But I never met him.

1766
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,480
Are you two also involved?

1767
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,280
No.

1768
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,120
But about him (Ning Que Wu Lan) killing someone,

1769
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,120
the two of them don't know.

1770
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,040
Only you two know.

1771
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,200
How would we know?

1772
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,840
You also know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) was replaced.

1773
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,280
I didn't know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) was replaced.

1774
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,560
Because before I went to find him (Ning Que Wu Lan),

1775
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,800
I didn't know who he (Ning Que Wu Lan) was.

1776
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,960
Do you understand?

1777
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,880
So he brought the wrong person.

1778
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,520
I didn't know it wasn't him (Ning Que Wu Lan) who came.

1779
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,200
Then it's obvious.

1780
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,360
Who?

1781
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,120
Her (Jin Zi Zhao Pai).

1782
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,400
Only those two know each other well.

1783
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,240
These things did happen.

1784
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,160
Then let's go with your line of reasoning.

1785
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,360
Make her the instigator.

1786
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,040
Right.

1787
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,360
For example, if I want to instigate Ning Que Wu Lan,

1788
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:23,960
Right?

1789
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,520
He (Ning Que Wu Lan) is the one who caused it.

1790
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,040
I broke up with my boyfriend.

1791
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,320
I know who he (Ning Que Wu Lan) has killed.

1792
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,360
How would I know?

1793
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,840
About his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) killing,

1794
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,600
that part of the incident,

1795
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,800
and the part where I killed someone,

1796
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,040
what do they have to do with each other?

1797
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,400
Let me give you another idea.

1798
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,440
If it's Ba Mian Ling Long,

1799
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,440
for example, she (Ba Mian Ling Long)

1800
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,480
went to investigate back then

1801
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,040
why her (Ba Mian Ling Long's) friend died after leaving the mountain.

1802
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
During the investigation, she found out

1803
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,280
that I was the one who killed her (Ba Mian Ling Long's) friend.

1804
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,320
It was a car accident.

1805
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,200
Wouldn't she (Ba Mian Ling Long) have a reason

1806
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,080
to instigate me?

1807
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,800
She (Ba Mian Ling Long) knows I'm that alternate account.

1808
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,320
And at the same time, I caused the death of

1809
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,880
her (Ba Mian Ling Long's) friend.

1810
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,000
She could have something on me.

1811
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,400
Isn't this line of reasoning more logical?

1812
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
There's no way I could know

1813
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,920
about any of the other three people

1814
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,600
being involved in a murder.

1815
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,640
You mean she (Ba Mian Linglong) was the instigator?

1816
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,320
She incited you?

1817
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:01,680
Yes.

1818
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,440
Yes.

1819
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,560
But that's absolutely impossible.

1820
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,400
Because I didn't want this matter

1821
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
to be known by anyone.

1822
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,440
So at that time,

1823
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,920
the debt collector told me

1824
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,640
that your friend

1825
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,240
after he fell off the cliff,

1826
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,320
I never mentioned this matter again.

1827
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,440
We have one point

1828
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,040
that hasn't been included in the clues for analysis.

1829
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,160
I understand what you're saying.

1830
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,480
Death occurred at 11:36.

1831
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,440
That's confirmed, right?

1832
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:26,920
Confirmed.

1833
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,040
Then there's a time of

1834
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,240
twenty-five minutes for

1835
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,480
the glue to come undone.

1836
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:31,800
The glue.

1837
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,600
And another twenty minutes for the ice to melt.

1838
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,080
Right?

1839
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,480
Right.

1840
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,480
We should sort out this timeline.

1841
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,400
11:36.

1842
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,040
The cause of death was that piece of cloth

1843
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,080
falling onto his face.

1844
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,760
The moment it covered the wound, he died instantly.

1845
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,160
So actually, it's that piece of cloth

1846
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,080
falling at that exact moment.

1847
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,160
That's the timing of the ice.

1848
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,800
It's the moment the ice melted.

1849
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,440
So does that mean

1850
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,920
it's actually this time?

1851
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,840
Go back twenty minutes from there.

1852
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,640
Yes.

1853
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,880
That's actually when the ice was placed.

1854
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,640
11:00.

1855
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,560
Sixteen minutes.

1856
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,320
Sixteen minutes.

1857
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,800
The ice.

1858
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,640
The killer must have been

1859
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,800
there while placing the ice.

1860
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,240
He must have been in the warehouse.

1861
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:02,800
Yes.

1862
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,440
So at 11:16,

1863
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,560
who has an alibi for that time?

1864
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,440
None of us can prove it.

1865
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,240
That's the key point.

1866
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,920
These three people are completely

1867
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,360
free during that time.

1868
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,120
In these twenty-five minutes, only

1869
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,160
only Jin has a complete alibi.

1870
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,760
And someone can confirm it.

1871
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,280
There's proof of it on the computer.

1872
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,520
At 11:14

1873
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,720
that cleaning lady

1874
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,840
saw Jin in the private room.

1875
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,120
There was someone in the restroom.

1876
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,000
What I'm trying to say is

1877
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,720
this is just too much of a coincidence.

1878
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,520
She (Jin) is too much like

1879
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,760
the instigator in her actions.

1880
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,640
She (Jin) knew exactly

1881
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,040
the killer would act during this time.

1882
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,920
They could commit the crime.

1883
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,240
She (Jin) put herself in a

1884
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,160
time slot with a perfect alibi.

1885
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,360
Let me say something about this.

1886
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,760
I think this clearly proves

1887
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,880
I wasn't at the scene at the time.

1888
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,080
That's right.

1889
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:58,880
You can prove it.

1890
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,520
Now the only thing I could be is

1891
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,080
a suspect for being the inquirer, right?

1892
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,040
I'm definitely not the killer.

1893
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,600
Okay.

1894
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,560
I accept that.

1895
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:05,920
Alright.

1896
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,720
So among these three,

1897
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,880
just decide from me.

1898
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,760
I'm the inquirer.

1899
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,440
Who do you think I would instigate?

1900
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,720
You could instigate a lot of people.

1901
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,080
How would I know

1902
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,040
if someone else has killed before?

1903
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,920
So only the instigator

1904
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,000
knows that my friend

1905
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,160
died at the hands of one of you.

1906
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:21,880
Yes.

1907
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,520
Let's talk about the instigator first.

1908
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,440
If we put the role on him (Ning Que Wu Lan),

1909
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,880
let's try reasoning it out this way, okay?

1910
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,520
Alright.

1911
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,840
That day, he (Ning Que Wu Lan) went home

1912
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,160
and found the door had been kicked open.

1913
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,880
Or maybe the neighborhood surveillance

1914
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,800
because his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend

1915
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,600
was with him (Ke Ban Chu Shen) at the time.

1916
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,560
In that situation,

1917
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,560
they were pushed down the mountain together.

1918
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,520
He (Ning Que Wu Lan) knew

1919
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,320
that he (Ke Ban Chu Shen) was going to look for him (Ning Que Wu Lan).

1920
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:39,880
Right.

1921
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,640
So he (Ning Que Wu Lan) hid.

1922
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,200
He called his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend over.

1923
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,520
Then his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend died.

1924
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,480
No, I don't know if it was his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend.

1925
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,880
Because I don't know if it was him (Ning Que Wu Lan).

1926
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,640
Actually,

1927
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,320
so you can't be the instigator.

1928
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,280
So I think it's just him (Ning Que Wu Lan).

1929
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:50,920
If it's between you two,

1930
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,080
he (Ning Que Wu Lan) is definitely the instigator.

1931
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,040
You treat him (Ning Que Wu Lan)

1932
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,520
as the instigator.

1933
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,520
He (Ning Que Wu Lan) could know

1934
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,360
He (Ning Que Wu Lan) hates him (Ke Ban Chu Shen)

1935
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,000
because he (Ke Ban Chu Shen) killed

1936
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,440
his (Ning Que Wu Lan's) friend.

1937
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,160
He (Ning Que Wu Lan) also has

1938
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,880
a reason to hate him (Ke Ban Chu Shen)

1939
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,000
and knows that he (Ke Ban Chu Shen) killed someone.

1940
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,640
Okay.

1941
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,280
Alright.

1942
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,400
I understand.

1943
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,720
And also, the "Infatuated Ghost" was switched.

1944
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,600
Yes.

1945
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,160
What does "Infatuated Ghost" mean?

1946
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,680
Suppose he (Ning Que Wu Lan) is the "Infatuated Ghost,"

1947
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,960
then who would be the instigator?

1948
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,840
You are her (Ba Mian Ling Long's) assistant.

1949
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,800
Everyone at school knows about this.

1950
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,680
Yes.

1951
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,680
An even more obvious "Infatuated Ghost."

1952
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,040
Right?

1953
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,440
Yes.

1954
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:25,760
But actually, he (Ke Ban Chu Shen)

1955
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,920
I think he could be the "Infatuated Ghost."

1956
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,800
Because he (Ke Ban Chu Shen) really loves you.

1957
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,840
It's just that neither of you talks to each other.

1958
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,240
Vote

1959
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,040
Vote

1960
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,440
Vote for whom

1961
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,480
The voting rules for this case have been upgraded

1962
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,040
Players must separately fill in

1963
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,840
the combination of instigator and perpetrator on the ballot

1964
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,000
A vote is considered successful only if both are correct

1965
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
There are two suspects for the real culprit today

1966
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,080
Ning should be the instigator

1967
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,680
Ke should be the killer

1968
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,960
Ning wanted to kill by using someone else

1969
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,320
to avenge his friend

1970
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,960
Then Ke thought

1971
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,320
Tui Baiyi found out about his murder

1972
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,800
so he had to kill to silence the witness

1973
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,160
I think Ning Quewulan is the culprit

1974
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,920
Ke, with a theatrical background, is his instigator

1975
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,760
I think these two people

1976
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,800
are the ones who killed the victim

1977
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,680
the real culprits

1978
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,480
I'm still confused today

1979
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,880
So my final vote is

1980
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,160
The suspects I vote for as the real culprits are

1981
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,320
Today, I will vote for

1982
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,400
Jin as the instigator

1983
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,200
Ning as the direct killer

1984
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,880
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1985
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,600
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

1986
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,640
Next, let's move on to

1987
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,760
Tongcheng Travel

1988
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,960
the moment of truth

1989
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,360
In today's case

1990
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,200
the suspects include

1991
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,120
Ba Mian Linglong

1992
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,440
Golden Signboard

1993
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,360
Ke Ban Background

1994
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,680
Better to have fewer but better

1995
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,280
After everyone's reasoning

1996
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,400
we have a total of three ticket types

1997
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,400
Three ticket types

1998
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,600
Who is the third one?

1999
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,160
It's over

2000
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,480
Where are the three types?

2001
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:20,880
It's reversed

2002
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,680
The three ticket types involve three people

2003
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,800
The three people formed three groups

2004
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,280
Group one is

2005
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,160
Better to have nothing than to settle for less.

2006
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,840
From the Ke class.

2007
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,800
Ning Ke.

2008
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,440
Ning Ke.

2009
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,400
The second combination is

2010
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,280
From the Ke class.

2011
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,160
Better to have nothing than to settle for less.

2012
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,400
Ke Ning.

2013
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:43,840
So what about that?

2014
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,400
Anyway, both of you have someone picked as the killer.

2015
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,120
Right.

2016
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,320
The third combination is

2017
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,920
The instigator is

2018
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,800
Jin Zi Zhaopai.

2019
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,200
The one who acted is

2020
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,040
Better to have nothing than to settle for less.

2021
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,200
Jin Ning.

2022
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,560
Among these three combinations,

2023
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,280
one combination received three votes.

2024
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,720
Looks like a big win.

2025
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,080
First, let's announce the combination that got one vote.

2026
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,320
The one who acted is

2027
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,680
Better to have nothing than to settle for less.

2028
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,000
The instigator is

2029
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,760
From the Ke class.

2030
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,640
Who voted for this?

2031
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,320
I did.

2032
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,200
The combination that received three votes

2033
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,800
Jinzi Zhaopai, Ning Que Wu Lan

2034
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,800
Three votes

2035
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,680
Who voted for Jin and Ning?

2036
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,280
Me

2037
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,280
Who else?

2038
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,600
I voted for Jin and Ning

2039
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,040
Jin is the instigator

2040
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,240
Ning is the direct murderer

2041
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,280
The real culprit I voted for is

2042
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,240
Ning Que Wu Lan

2043
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,480
And Jinzi Zhaopai kept encouraging him

2044
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,840
Ning should be the instigator

2045
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,360
Ke should be the murderer

2046
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,880
During the discussion

2047
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,000
The candidate for Chixinguai

2048
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,839
has always been very, very difficult to decide

2049
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:05,719
A candidate

2050
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:07,000
Ning is possible

2051
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,120
Ke is also possible

2052
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,759
But

2053
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,320
When the boss was writing Chixinguai

2054
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,839
during the process of creating these characters

2055
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:14,200
he must have

2056
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,440
after learning about these people's stories

2057
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,600
formed a conclusion about the incident

2058
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,000
I think this person

2059
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,040
in this matter,

2060
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:26,799
what kind of motive does he have?

2061
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,560
As for the word "devoted,"

2062
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,920
if you apply it to Ning's original character setting,

2063
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,839
he really is someone who is

2064
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:35,839
very devoted to his own artists.

2065
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,000
But when it comes to committing the crime,

2066
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,560
Ke's motive for the crime

2067
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,240
was actually driven by love.

2068
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,879
The person Ning replaced

2069
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:47,400
So his motive for the crime

2070
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,600
really fits the word "devoted."

2071
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,080
So from the boss's perspective,

2072
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,320
if you have to label someone

2073
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,280
as the "Devoted Ghost,"

2074
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,320
it must be based on their motive.

2075
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,440
So I think the "Devoted Ghost"

2076
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,280
fits Ke's background better

2077
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,120
rather than Ning Que Wu Lan.

2078
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,799
So the real culprit I choose is

2079
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,080
Ke Ban Chushen.

2080
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,280
As for the instigator,

2081
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,240
I chose Ning Que Wu Lan.

2082
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,600
The instigator is Jin.

2083
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,759
The perpetrator is myself.

2084
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,120
Next,

2085
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:19,799
let's announce

2086
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,799
whether everyone has correctly identified the culprit.

2087
01:10:24,839 --> 01:10:26,600
The culprit for this case

2088
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,080
Failure

2089
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:37,719
Pure culprit

2090
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,040
Look, he can't even hide his smile.

2091
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,480
Seriously?

2092
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,240
Still pretending

2093
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:46,920
I'm speechless

2094
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,760
Instigation

2095
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's you two

2096
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,720
Those two

2097
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,520
You two

2098
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,640
You two

2099
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,240
Those two

2100
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:54,800
Those two

2101
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,520
Just those two

2102
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,640
Hurry up and say it

2103
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,200
The real culprit is

2104
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,840
The instigator is

2105
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,800
Better to have none than settle for less

2106
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,440
The one who did it is

2107
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,920
From the science class

2108
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,600
I want to ask why

2109
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:36,040
Loving you is a lonely secret

2110
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,160
Our logic is correct

2111
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,800
It's actually just a matter of two pairs

2112
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,280
Second pairing

2113
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,400
Winning this round feels so good

2114
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,600
That win felt so good, bro.

2115
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,800
So satisfying.

2116
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:51,480
No.

2117
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,720
Why did you kill someone?

2118
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,320
I'm speechless.

2119
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,160
What's the reason?

2120
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:54,600
You're lovesick, aren't you?

2121
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,160
He put me up to it.

2122
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,840
I'm the lovesick one.

2123
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,880
What makes him so lovesick?

2124
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,200
You're obsessed with me.

2125
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,880
Very much.

2126
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,440
Back in 2023,

2127
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,160
I confessed my feelings to her.

2128
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,960
Because I really liked her.

2129
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,080
She happily accepted my confession.

2130
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,720
After that, the two of us

2131
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,200
were happily together.

2132
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,800
He's my love.

2133
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,400
You even wrote songs for me.

2134
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,360
Until one day,

2135
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,240
I saw her phone

2136
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,440
and found some chat messages.

2137
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,360
After reading them,

2138
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,840
I was really upset.

2139
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,880
He confessed to another woman right in front of me.

2140
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,760
Did you fall for her?

2141
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,880
I li—

2142
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,040
No, I didn't. I actually didn't like her that much.

2143
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,280
Ke Ban even gave me lots of glass slippers.

2144
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,080
That's a man's devotion.

2145
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,920
Loving someone,

2146
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,040
but giving shoes to someone else in another situation.

2147
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,280
That's called being lovesick.

2148
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,480
That's more like wishful thinking.

2149
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,360
So you really did it to make her jealous?

2150
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,040
I want you to win.

2151
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,280
I'm speechless.

2152
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,040
There's no X in today's case.

2153
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,200
The crucial evidence that was missed is

2154
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,720
where?

2155
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,720
It's in Ning Que Wu Lan.

2156
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,680
It's in Keban Chushen's phone.

2157
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,200
In Keban Chushen's phone.

2158
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,840
It shows his phone number.

2159
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,280
The person who arranged to meet him at the abandoned warehouse

2160
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,360
used the same number.

2161
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,600
Who made that call to the director?

2162
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,480
I made the call.

2163
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:26,880
I arranged to meet him at that warehouse.

2164
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,560
I arranged to meet him at that warehouse.

2165
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,320
There's also crucial evidence about Ning Que Wu Lan

2166
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,400
on his phone as well.

2167
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,560
In his settings, it shows

2168
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,840
the account he logged in with is

2169
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,600
"Early Retirement."

2170
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,600
Your phone username is

2171
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,920
Next time, the phone must be checked.

2172
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,280
Don't say anything.

2173
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,600
Hand over your phone first.

2174
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,560
Let's check it first.

2175
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,200
Phone.

2176
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,200
Playing really well.

2177
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,840
I just made him develop the intent to kill.

2178
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,520
Everything that happened,

2179
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,200
he carried out the actions himself afterward.

2180
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:57,880
Yes.

2181
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,400
Right.

2182
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,040
When I came here today, I thought

2183
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,840
I was the only killer today.

2184
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,600
I didn't know he was here too.

2185
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,040
So at first, I kept leading the discussion.

2186
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,240
The boss must have known

2187
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,240
who the harmful one was.

2188
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,120
He replaced the Death Ghost

2189
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,360
with the Infatuated Ghost.

2190
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,600
Let's take a look at this.

2191
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,280
Actually, it's related to that name.

2192
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:13,720
Coward.

2193
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,120
I think it fits me.

2194
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,600
It really sounds like it suits me.

2195
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,960
There's also a Betrayer Ghost.

2196
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,000
Watching a friend step into danger

2197
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,320
because they trusted him.

2198
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,120
I even led everyone to say

2199
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,320
those two might be the same person.

2200
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,560
That these two are actually one person.

2201
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,080
Because at that time, I still didn't know

2202
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,600
until He said

2203
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,360
the Inquirer might be

2204
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,320
the one who switched the cards.

2205
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,720
What did he want to do?

2206
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,400
He wanted you to kill someone.

2207
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,280
So basically, this is using someone else to do your dirty work.

2208
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,200
I just realized I was being used as a tool.

2209
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,480
The killer's logic is

2210
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,800
the person who actually does it is the murderer.

2211
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,480
Or is it

2212
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,520
the one who directly causes the death is the murderer?

2213
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,880
If I incite you to do it,

2214
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,000
does that mean I'm not a murderer?

2215
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,160
Why is it that only the one who directly causes the death

2216
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,040
is considered the murderer?

2217
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,800
I think your logic is too weak.

2218
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,640
Instigating murder

2219
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,640
how is that not murder?

2220
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,120
Good deduction.

2221
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,760
Two culprits.

2222
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,480
The only ones who know I caused someone's death

2223
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,320
are probably Ning and Jin.

2224
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,000
Ning seemed really uneasy today.

2225
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,120
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

2226
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,120
You seem a little uncomfortable, I feel.

2227
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,400
I really think you're a bit nervous and uneasy.

2228
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,880
Alright.

2229
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,600
Wait, he is—

2230
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,720
You know, from my angle,

2231
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,360
I can see this side of his face.

2232
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,000
The veins on this side are bulging.

2233
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,560
Today I heard about

2234
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,400
a coward's story.

2235
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,560
In a moment of danger, he chose to run away,

2236
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,760
leaving his friend to face all the disaster.

2237
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,000
I think it's him.

2238
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,400
You kind of count too.

2239
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,200
Why?

2240
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,560
I called you and asked you to come save me,

2241
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,640
but you didn't come either.

2242
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,080
It's him, the lovesick fool.

2243
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,040
You won't stay away from me because of this, right?

2244
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,400
It's you.

2245
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,240
You're her (Ba Mian Linglong's) assistant.

2246
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,200
Everyone at school knows about this.

2247
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,080
Yes.

2248
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,080
An even more obvious lovesick fool.

2249
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:00,440
Right?

2250
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:00,840
Yes.

2251
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,200
I just think the instigator is him.

2252
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,200
You have to know this person has killed before.

2253
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,680
And you have a reason to hate this person.

2254
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,920
If you narrow it down like this,

2255
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,920
there are only two possibilities:

2256
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,640
She (Ba Mian Linglong) instigated me,

2257
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,280
and you instigated him (Ke Ban Chushen).

2258
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,440
These two sets of relationships.

2259
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,120
There's one more premise.

2260
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,440
Because this boss knows

2261
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,120
this person's little secret.

2262
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,080
He knows this person has killed.

2263
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,160
So he can control this person at will.

2264
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,920
The chances of her (the golden signboard) being easily manipulated

2265
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:25,800
are a bit higher.

2266
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,320
Are you two also involved?

2267
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,120
No.

2268
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,960
But about the murder he committed,

2269
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,960
the two of them don't know.

2270
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,120
Only you two know.

2271
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,360
How would we know?

2272
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,280
You also know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) switched people.

2273
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,480
I didn't know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) switched people.

2274
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,760
Because before I went to find him (Ning Que Wu Lan),

2275
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,600
I didn't know who he (Ning Que Wu Lan) was.

2276
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,120
Do you understand?

2277
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,240
So he brought the wrong person.

2278
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,720
I didn't know it wasn't him (Ning Que Wu Lan) who came.

2279
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:46,960
That's obvious then.

2280
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,160
Who?

2281
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,920
Her.

2282
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,200
Only those two know each other well.

2283
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,040
These things did happen.

2284
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,400
I accept my loss willingly.

2285
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,440
Because I lost to love.

2286
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,400
Next, we will announce today's golden key.

2287
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,360
The two culprits, Keban Chushen

2288
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,480
and Ning Que Wu Lan

2289
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,520
can each receive a golden key.

2290
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,520
That's great!

2291
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,600
Just because he's devoted.

2292
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,200
You don't mind losing now, do you?

2293
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,080
Alright.

2294
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,680
Ning Que Wu Lan used a double card.

2295
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,560
The double card designates a specific golden key.

2296
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,400
Their own golden key.

2297
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,920
So Ning Que Wu Lan

2298
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,840
can receive two golden keys.

2299
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,040
You used a card today.

2300
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:35,600
Yes.

2301
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,800
You trust me that much?

2302
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,280
Because I think having two culprits is difficult.

2303
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,400
If I were the only culprit,

2304
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,560
I might not have the courage.

2305
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,840
So winning today feels great, little brother.

2306
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,680
He really profited this round.

2307
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,440
If you don't take it, I will.

2308
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:46,880
No.

2309
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,560
You present it to me.

2310
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,520
I'll take it myself.

2311
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,000
Take it myself.

2312
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,960
Today, Dilraba also used it on Liu Yuning

2313
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,920
She used her designated card

2314
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,200
Designated card

2315
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,440
Assign a persona to a specific player

2316
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,680
I want to give Liu Yuning

2317
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,760
the persona of someone who always obeys orders

2318
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,720
Okay

2319
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:09,840
After knowing each other for so many years

2320
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,600
In her heart

2321
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,480
Turns out she always wanted me to be her assistant

2322
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:13,640
Alright

2323
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,440
Looks like I have a job lined up for the future

2324
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,160
I'll try my best to be obedient this episode

2325
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,200
Key

2326
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:21,880
Key

2327
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,200
Storage room key

2328
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,840
He is her mentor

2329
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,720
He's her mentor

2330
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,320
He's your mentor

2331
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:26,640
That's right

2332
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,800
What's your relationship?

2333
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,760
She's my artist

2334
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,320
Accidentally revealed some of my

2335
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,080
appearance

2336
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:33,920
beauty

2337
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,480
I didn't expect that

2338
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,760
He accidentally rolled down that mountain

2339
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,400
and died from the fall

2340
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:38,760
It's okay

2341
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,400
You really don't need to blame yourself

2342
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,880
Everyone has their own fate

2343
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,240
That was his fate, nothing could be done

2344
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,960
Maybe that bathroom is connected

2345
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,600
She makes sense

2346
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,040
A lot of love

2347
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,920
stays by your side in the form of friendship

2348
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,440
This box holds my lonely feelings

2349
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,800
Loving you is a lonely feeling

2350
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,080
I'm her assistant

2351
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,320
And sometimes when it rains

2352
01:18:59,320 --> 01:18:59,880
I hold an umbrella for her

2353
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,000
But at those times, I just

2354
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,800
I can hold a bit for myself too

2355
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,760
This is the umbrella we used together

2356
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,680
I can hold a bit for myself too

2357
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:09,120
Whatever Ba says goes

2358
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,960
Take good care of her

2359
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,480
You're all here.

2360
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,600
Assistant director.

2361
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,080
All the company employees have already left for the day.

2362
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,360
How is your investigation going?

2363
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,480
So, who is the culprit?

2364
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,080
Him.

2365
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,560
Him.

2366
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,480
He's the culprit.

2367
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,160
Nothing can interfere with

2368
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,400
the progress of our company project.

2369
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,120
Yes.

2370
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,440
So our midnight boot camp

2371
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,560
will still proceed as scheduled.

2372
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,400
But this incident

2373
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,240
can't just be treated as if it never happened.

2374
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,880
After we enter the camp first,

2375
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,600
wait until things calm down.

2376
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,920
Then you can quietly withdraw.

2377
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,520
Alright, I promise you.

2378
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,240
The location of our boot camp

2379
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,720
is at the Tuishan Food Factory next door.

2380
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,280
Okay.

2381
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,360
At the end of February,

2382
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,480
there was an explosion there.

2383
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,440
The factory director died.

2384
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,680
Now we've requisitioned it.

2385
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,280
It's been converted into our boot camp.

2386
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,040
I'll wait for you at midnight then.

2387
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,640
Alright.

2388
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,400
It's ten o'clock at night.

2389
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,080
You can still go

2390
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,480
to the lounge inside the company building

2391
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,080
and rest for a while.

2392
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,640
Okay.

2393
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,120
I don't like being late.

2394
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,200
Be on time—midnight.

2395
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,320
No problem.

2396
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:15,640
Let's go.

2397
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,280
Alright.

2398
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,560
I think true friendship

2399
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,920
actually comes down to four words

2400
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,720
which are equality and respect

2401
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,640
First of all

2402
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,360
there should be boundaries between friends

2403
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,840
I don't overextend myself

2404
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,960
nor do I excessively

2405
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,920
demand more from you

2406
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,600
this is called appropriate boundaries

2407
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,080
The second point is

2408
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,680
to have positive emotional support

2409
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,000
The third point is

2410
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,640
honest communication

2411
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,240
For example, if we have a conflict

2412
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,040
often we suppress our own feelings

2413
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,080
and over time

2414
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,400
as these feelings build up

2415
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,720
they accumulate bit by bit

2416
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,040
and one day, they might

2417
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,960
explode in an unexpected way

2418
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,560
So what we suggest is

2419
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,000
timely and honest communication

2420
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,040
but pay attention to how you communicate

2421
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,600
Another thing is

2422
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,200
we believe a good friendship

2423
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,520
should be able to grow

2424
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,720
meaning both of us

2425
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,160
should, through this friendship

2426
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,600
ultimately become

2427
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,720
better versions of ourselves than before

2428
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,320
The training camp location

2429
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,360
is at the Tui Tian food factory next door

2430
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,840
Don't forget, someone died there

2431
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,160
There's a smell of burnt corpse

2432
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:20,840
What's going on?

2433
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,760
Someone died again.

2434
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,200
What do you mean?

2435
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,040
This is the most gruesome death I've ever seen.

2436
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,320
There's nothing scary, right?

2437
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,320
Someone died.

2438
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,200
What is it?

2439
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,080
That was just an accident.

2440
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,000
I just walked by and saw some paint there.

2441
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,160
I knocked it over.

2442
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,560
You can tell from the soles of his shoes.

2443
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,040
He didn't go back again.

2444
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,560
What do you mean by proving he didn't go back?

2445
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,880
You're ruled out.

2446
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,000
The five of us went there.

2447
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,800
We saw that piece of paper.

2448
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,760
That's when we figured out the method of the murder.

2449
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,280
I'm ruled out too.

2450
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,240
There's a "three, two, one" inside.

2451
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,640
So when the director was talking to you,

2452
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,720
someone else was counting down "three, two, one."

2453
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,600
This also rules me out.

2454
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,520
It depends on the situation.

2455
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,280
I think so too.

2456
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,480
The suspicion is a bit lighter.

2457
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,080
Wait a second.

2458
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,920
There's paint on this.

2459
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,200
You have it too.

2460
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,240
Just lock in the culprit.

2461
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,040
Why would I kill him?

2462
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,800
Because he was coming back to kill you.

2463
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,520
He wanted revenge.

2464
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,560
By any means necessary.

2465
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,360
He set up a big plan.

2466
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,080
This is real.

2467
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:11,840
They're not extras.

2468
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,600
They're not acting.

2469
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,800
Did any of you get bitten?

2470
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,440
Yes.

2471
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,080
No. Who?

2472
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,000
I am the culprit in this case.

2473
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,920
For the sake of my career,

2474
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,040
and my future,

2475
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,320
I had to kill him before the audition to silence him.

2476
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:30,800
It's clear

2477
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,920
he was investigating the secrets of the six of us.

2478
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,120
With a background like Koban's, he would definitely kill Tui Baiyi.

2479
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,160
My plan to kill by using someone else was a success.

2480
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,640
Wow, so cool.

2481
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:39,960
Cool.

2482
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,880
I'm speechless.

2483
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,480
You still need to turn a bit.

2484
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,200
Come on.

2485
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,240
But I still prefer that one.

2486
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,840
Lower the height a little.

2487
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,480
Okay, that's good.

2488
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,840
I don't know why he had to be killed.

2489
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
Alright, the stress test is passed.

2490
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,800
You, come here.

2491
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,400
If you can't beat them, join them.

2492
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,520
There's an earring on the left.

2493
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,800
They were just there.

2494
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:15,840
My name is—

2495
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,400
Pull.

2496
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:17,960
Wait a moment.

2497
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,320
Let me take a break.

2498
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,280
Wake up.

2499
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,160
Top extra.

2500
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,880
I don't have time to mess around with you anymore.
