1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,920
I want to have a little showdown.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,360
You guys running out like that—

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,840
I'll let it go this time.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,840
Is he really volunteering like this?

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,360
Absolutely.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,240
He's the brave one.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,360
One, two, one.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,880
This one is called King Ke the Dancer.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,560
A perfect match for the job.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,360
Turn right.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,520
All of this—

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,840
These are all easy tasks for me.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,120
Turn around.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,120
Bai Yu, you're so handsome.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm really speechless.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,120
Braised food.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Braised food.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,160
This squid is so delicious.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,080
Sorry.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,320
This thing is called "Hao Da Dan."

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,000
At night, each of us takes one.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
That way, we won't lose each other.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Look, we're all connected in a line.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
That's what it means.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Why don't you need it? Others do.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
I want to have a little competition.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Someone from among you

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,320
should be chosen as a representative.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,000
Come on, this one.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Is he volunteering so willingly?

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,200
Of course.

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
He's the brave one.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
No matter what it is.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,920
Even if it's "death," it's his today.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,920
If you can do it as well as my men

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,800
to the same standard,

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,280
then your running away

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
will be forgiven by me.

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,320
What responsibility will we have if we run away?

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't know.

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
What responsibility will there be for running away?

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,640
Then...

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
That's just how we are.

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,840
That's right.

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,360
One, two, three.

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
There are four of us men.

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Each of us is about 1.8 meters tall.

48
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
If each of us fought two people,

49
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,560
we probably still couldn't win.

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
So we'd better just behave.

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
Let's listen.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,639
You guys are tall.

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,720
But when our blood pressure rises,

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
it's not low either.

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,200
Blood pressure.

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Stop laughing.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,160
Come back.

58
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm not telling you a joke.

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
Where were we just now?

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Right.

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,040
It's this volunteer.

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Okay.

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,800
Alright, then it's him.

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,040
Alright.

65
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,160
You, as your team's representative,

66
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
please come over here.

67
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Come on.

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,200
Do we have anyone left who can still move?

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,960
Yes, of course we do.

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
Number three, step forward.

71
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,600
Yes.

72
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay.

73
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
What's this for?

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Is this an octagon cage?

75
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Octagon cage.

76
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Alright, it's very simple.

77
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
The first test is

78
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
marching in place.

79
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,080
It's so cold.

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,160
Are you all that cold?

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,320
Come here.

82
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
Aren't you cold?

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
She didn't bring a jacket.

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
Let me act like a gentleman for a moment.

85
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm playing a role.

86
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm playing a role.

87
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
She didn't bring a jacket.

88
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,080
Such a warm jacket.

89
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,760
You all really love me.

90
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Thank you all.

91
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,880
Everyone, march in place.

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,040
One, two, one.

93
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
One, two.

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,040
Alright.

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,600
Let's stop for now.

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
If you learn this,

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,800
you'll be able to tap dance.

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
Let me try.

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
Let me try.

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,520
I was feeling sleepy just now.

101
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
Now I'm energized.

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
I like physical punishment.

103
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
I like this.

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
One is left, two is right, right?

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes, that's right.

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,560
But we're going to switch to something else.

107
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,000
Hand your sword back first.

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,720
Take the sword back.

109
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,399
Put down your weapons for now.

110
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Next, we're going to test turning right.

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,680
Come on.

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,400
Everyone.

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Turn right.

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
Come on, you try.

115
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,120
It's fine, let me tell you.

116
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
You might not know this.

117
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,160
This guy is called King Ke the Dancer.

118
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
No.

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,920
No.

120
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
It's a perfect match for his skills.

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,280
Street dance boy.

122
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,760
Stuff like "Phoenix Dance in the Sky."

123
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
He can do all of that.

124
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,280
Go ahead.

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
He’s got the fighting spirit.

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
Not bad, I like it.

127
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,040
Okay.

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
Do we need to step back a bit?

129
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,160
Or what do you think?

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,920
No need.

131
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,360
Actually, I’ve been dancing for eight years.

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Breakdancing.

133
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
Breakdancing.

134
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Be careful.

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
Don’t mess us up.

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,760
Okay.

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,600
Let me tell you.

138
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Be careful you don’t get blown away.

139
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Because he’s so big,

140
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
when he spins, it’s like an electric fan.

141
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
Okay.

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,960
The floor’s slippery, watch your step.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,760
You can go slower.

144
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay, follow my command.

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
Street dance boy.

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
Perfect match for his skills.

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
This guy is called King Ke the Dancer.

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Turn right.

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
Turn right.

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
Awesome.

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,920
Impressive.

152
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,920
Do you have anything else to say?

153
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
I feel like

154
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
he spins better than Third Brother.

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,840
Who is Third Brother?

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,560
You get down, I'll take your place.

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,800
You have to hold on for someone.

158
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,560
Come back here.

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,640
A bit unsteady.

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,400
Come on.

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,480
Anyone else want to give it a try?

162
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,080
Anyone else?

163
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,840
This isn't hard.

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,760
Anyone can do this.

165
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,640
Not difficult at all.

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
It's getting harder.

167
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,120
So,

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
the sooner you go, the better.

169
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,680
So,

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
He Chongchong.

171
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Chongchong.

172
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Chongchong, your turn. Chongchong.

173
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,840
He Chongchong.

174
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,320
Chongchong.

175
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,920
Let me go, Chongchong.

176
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,280
Everyone, get ready.

177
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
About face.

178
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Okay.

179
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,720
Alright.

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
He Chongchong.

181
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Wait a moment.

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Can anyone here do it?

183
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
No, that's impossible.

184
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Should we discuss it?

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Or what, just go for it directly?

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Just go for it.

187
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay.

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
If you get hit on the back of your head,

189
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
if the back of your head hits the ground, it's easy to

190
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
just directly

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,280
"die."

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,000
Sure, no problem.

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
We can admit defeat.

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
The mic fell off.

195
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,800
Mic.

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Can you really do it?

197
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,320
No, I mean, can you really do it?

198
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,960
What do you think?

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Alright, then I'll...

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,080
Okay, let's do it this way.

201
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
He should have a solution now.

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Alright, I'll give your team a simple

203
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,480
discussion time.

204
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,120
No problem.

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
No need to discuss.

206
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,640
All of this is

207
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
just a small task, no problem at all.

208
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,280
Chongchong.

209
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Chongchong.

210
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
Chongchong.

211
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,480
Get ready, face backward.

212
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
Turn.

213
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
Amazing.

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
Impressive.

215
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
So messy.

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,000
Really so messy.

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
You won because of your conviction.

218
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,720
That's right.

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
If I were you and did this,

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,760
I'd be too embarrassed to take a bow.

221
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Not bad.

222
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,680
Very good.

223
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,680
You look beautiful.

224
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Queen.

225
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
You're like a cheerleader.

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm your Diana.

227
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Give some praise every day first.

228
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
That way, everyone starts work in a good mood.

229
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
White hair.

230
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,680
Bro

231
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,360
I went back and reviewed things yesterday

232
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,679
I was reviewing and didn't sleep

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
Then I lay in bed and reviewed everything carefully

234
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,679
But while reviewing, I reached a point

235
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,000
that really moved me

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,840
Do you remember the last two times

237
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,039
when you made a mistake with your vote or something

238
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,919
I would message you

239
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,919
Later, I realized

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,760
because I saw myself in you

241
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,280
I felt like you were me

242
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,320
So when you made a mistake

243
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,080
I was actually comforting the part of myself that made mistakes

244
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
What is this

245
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,680
Why did I

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,440
feel the need to explain to you this morning

247
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,120
Because I was seeking comfort for myself

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,720
Because you know

249
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
I've told my colleagues countless times

250
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
that after recording this show

251
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,480
I realized how great you are

252
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,760
Because you're someone who jokes a lot

253
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,560
But every time

254
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
you know, after you say something

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
do you know it really hurts me

256
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,360
After you tell a joke

257
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,200
you always tell everyone

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,880
"I'm just kidding"

259
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm just joking.

260
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Then I thought to myself,

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
how many times have you been scolded,

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
or how much have you been wronged,

263
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
that someone who likes to joke

264
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
least likes to say

265
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,760
"I'm just joking."

266
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
Because you know a joke is meant to be told,

267
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,520
and once everyone laughs, that's it.

268
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
That's really good.

269
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
It's something I need to learn.

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,200
Because after I say something as a joke,

271
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
I don't add that extra line.

272
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,720
Do you know why he adds it?

273
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
I think

274
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
it's projecting your own feelings onto others.

275
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,840
I think you add it

276
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,960
because you've been scolded too many times.

277
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,040
You've been wronged too much.

278
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,520
You know some jokes others just can't understand.

279
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,160
So you have to add that extra line,

280
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
"I'm just joking," so others get it.

281
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,000
That really makes me feel for you.

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,240
Right?

283
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
You see yourself in this.

284
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm the same way.

285
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
I really like you, bro.

286
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:47,880
Thank you.

287
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
I truly wish you well.

288
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,600
He first says "white cut black."

289
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
Then everyone's expression changes.

290
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
He says, "Shh."

291
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
Then everyone goes, "Shh," like this.

292
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,120
That's it.

293
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
Teach me how to do "white cut black."

294
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,840
"White cut black."

295
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
And the "cut black" part?

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Just suddenly like this—

297
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,440
give a wicked smile.

298
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,960
Turn your mouth downwards.

299
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,440
Shouldn't we just start by scratching our heads?

300
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,040
Like this.

301
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,120
Scratch your head.

302
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Scratch your head again.

303
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Looks a bit silly.

304
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Why did you do that first?

305
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,080
Let's chat happily first.

306
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Right?

307
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Isn't that so?

308
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
We just need to be happy, right?

309
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,560
Innocent on the outside, cunning on the inside.

310
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,520
Then, shh.

311
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,080
It can't get better than this.

312
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,040
There's one more.

313
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,080
Teachers.

314
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,240
Let's do it all in one take.

315
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Get ready.

316
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Let's go!

317
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
One take.

318
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,040
Three, two, one, go.

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,760
Sorry.

320
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,000
Sorry.

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
I wanted to press it and then let it pop up, but...

322
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,640
It popped up like this.

323
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,200
Sorry.

324
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,720
Three, two, one, go.

325
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
There's wind blowing.

326
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,880
But I realized it couldn't move.

327
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,640
The mousse made it too stiff.

328
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,680
Alright, perfect.

329
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,400
Thanks for your hard work.

330
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
Handsome.

331
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Thank you.

332
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,400
Okay, three, two, one, go.

333
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,440
You have the potential to be a director.

334
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,680
Director Ning.

335
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
We should do something unique.

336
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
Let's go down backwards.

337
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Like this.

338
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,440
Right.

339
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,840
If you keep going backwards like this,

340
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
halfway down you might end up rolling.

341
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
Okay, next.

342
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm going to cheer for him.

343
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Bai Yu.

344
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,280
Bai Yu.

345
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
Bai Yu is so handsome.

346
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
Come on, let's do it again, the four of us.

347
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
Let's walk it again, all four of us.

348
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,440
Three, two, one, go.

349
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,640
You two, slow down.

350
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,120
Wait for the two of us to go down.

351
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
Shouldn't we communicate a bit?

352
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
It feels like, doing it this way,

353
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,080
there's no drama at all.

354
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,960
Today, we are

355
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,720
the most handsome "suspects."

356
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,200
Secretly stand a bit taller yourself.

357
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,160
It's not that I'm standing on a higher step.

358
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,640
It's his...

359
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
His clothes are hanging too far back.

360
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,560
Look.

361
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,840
I stepped on his clothes several times.

362
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,120
It made him slip down.

363
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
Be careful, don't slip.

364
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
It's really slippery.

365
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,960
That staircase is pretty narrow.

366
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Three, two, one, go.

367
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,600
When the sword is drawn, who laughs at grudges?

368
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,000
When the sword is drawn, who laughs at grudges?

369
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
What are you holding?

370
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
What are you holding?

371
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
Do you know what this is?

372
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,960
Of course I know, do I need to ask you?

373
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,640
I really want to kick you.

374
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,080
Hula hoop.

375
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,200
This hula hoop

376
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Where are you spinning it?

377
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,360
Where are you spinning it?

378
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm asking you.

379
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
This is specially prepared for you.

380
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,800
This thing is called "Hao Dadan."

381
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,480
At night, each of us takes one.

382
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,960
That way, we won't lose each other.

383
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
We can move forward together.

384
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,160
I think

385
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
Why don't you need it, but others do?

386
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Who needs it?

387
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Look, we're connected in a line.

388
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,600
Do you understand?

389
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
That's what it means.

390
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,440
This way, we won't get separated at night.

391
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
What, do we not have hands?

392
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,280
And still need to hold a ring?

393
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
Isn't this for the show's effect?

394
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
It's not.

395
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,520
How about this: you jump rope with this twenty times.

396
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,640
Then I'll use this.

397
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
I promise I won't let go of it.

398
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I've already taken off my coat.

399
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,920
Because it's too much trouble.

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,320
It's a bit chilly today, bro.

401
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,120
It's cold. Today is cold.

402
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,880
It really is a bit cold.

403
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
No, I took off my cape.

404
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,320
Otherwise, if I squat down,

405
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,920
someone might step on it.

406
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,800
You might be walking in front,

407
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,880
and we could step on it from behind.

408
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,280
Just flick it off, that's fine.

409
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,120
Tuxedo Mask.

410
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,200
As long as it's warm, it's fine.

411
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
What time is your flight?

412
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,680
My flight is at eight.

413
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,040
Can you make it by eight?

414
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,600
Of course.

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,640
Even if I can't, I have to.

416
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,160
Yeah.

417
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Can't you leave early tomorrow morning?

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
We start work early tomorrow.

419
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,320
No choice, we've been on the road for two days.

420
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,040
After filming, you're done, right?

421
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,880
Not yet.

422
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
He's been filming for five months.

423
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,840
For us, in a bit, it's just—

424
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,640
Bang, bang, and it's done.

425
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,600
Sister Ba has to leave too.

426
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,680
It's fine, Sister Ba, go ahead.

427
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,120
You should leave too.

428
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Later on, we will...

429
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,480
We'll stay here and keep recording.

430
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,480
Let's take care of the later part...

431
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Fill up the remaining twenty minutes of the show.

432
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,760
Okay.

433
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,320
Let's shoot some film-style content to fill it up.

434
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,000
We'll edit a few scenes together.

435
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
You guys can dance.

436
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,160
Dance for twenty minutes.

437
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,040
No one will watch us dance.

438
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,600
People definitely watch dancing.

439
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,680
Depends on who is dancing.

440
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,640
If certain people dance, there will definitely be viewers.

441
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,280
Can anyone tell me

442
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
what this thing is?

443
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
It's a microphone, bro.

444
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,600
You can't even recognize that?

445
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
Get closer.

446
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,000
Come on, you.

447
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,560
Can't you hear my voice is louder now?

448
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,200
Can't you tell the sound is spreading more?

449
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,040
That's what a microphone does.

450
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,160
There's also reverb.

451
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Right.

452
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
Bai Yu, you're so handsome.

453
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm speechless.

454
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,160
I really...

455
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,600
Stop eating that, it'll make you sleepy.

456
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,040
There's "sleeping pills" in this.

457
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,480
I haven't eaten.

458
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
You're still so beautiful.

459
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
Smells so good.

460
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,320
Ke, the dance king.

461
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
What are you doing?

462
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm taking this.

463
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Go ahead.

464
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,440
Okay.

465
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,200
You’re making it hard for others to quiet down.

466
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,880
Look at you, seriously.

467
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
You’re just like a kindergarten kid.

468
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,200
All day long.

469
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,240
Sorry.

470
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,520
Let’s play this.

471
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,920
Let’s see which of us is the goddess of luck.

472
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,119
We won’t end up with the last one.

473
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,000
Is this broken?

474
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,880
This one.

475
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,600
There’s none left.

476
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,480
There’s still more.

477
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,680
This one seems broken, right?

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,080
We’re not going to end up with the last one, are we?

479
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,640
We got to the last one and there’s nothing left.

480
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,760
You didn’t even put this one in.

481
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,800
Some of them weren’t put in.

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
Does it really need to jump that high?

483
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Good thing my face wasn't here.

484
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,320
What are you two up to?

485
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
I was so scared I started sweating.

486
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,840
We were locked in together that day.

487
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,800
We were locked in together.

488
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,760
I remembered everything.

489
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Each of your birthdays.

490
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,880
Really?

491
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
Didn't you say so?

492
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,720
Go ahead, just say it.

493
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,680
I was just making it up.

494
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
December 30th.

495
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,480
You only know mine.

496
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,440
January 8th.

497
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,920
Really?

498
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes, really.

499
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,960
You are...

500
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
What am I?

501
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,560
December 27th.

502
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Virgo.

503
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,960
You're an Aries.

504
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,000
That's right.

505
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,080
You really remember?

506
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,960
I remember you're an Aries.

507
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,680
Really?

508
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Yes, she really remembers.

509
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm a Gemini.

510
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
I knew it, you actually...

511
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,080
The way you acted just now didn't seem real.

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,240
Still, I'm really touched.

513
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Come on, everyone.

514
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,600
There's food.

515
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,320
There's food.

516
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
That's great!

517
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,840
You're grilling for us again early in the morning.

518
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,400
What do you mean, early in the morning?

519
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
What time is it now, man?

520
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,720
Yeah.

521
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
Braised snacks

522
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
Yes

523
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
What else is there?

524
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,920
Fruit

525
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,720
Food to eat

526
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Barbecue

527
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,000
Braised snacks

528
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,880
Tuitan

529
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Sit in the middle

530
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,680
Then I can't reach the food

531
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,360
Then sit here

532
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,640
Tuitan sits in the middle

533
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,560
I'll sit next to Tuitan

534
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,400
You can reach both tables

535
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,560
No, just put everything on the table

536
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,240
Then whoever wants to eat can come and get it, okay?

537
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,280
Sorry

538
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,240
Wearing a cape does this

539
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,880
I was like this yesterday too

540
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
Yeah, this is so heavy

541
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,640
I can't drag it over at all

542
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
Keeps bumping

543
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,280
Thank you

544
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,960
Let's quickly have a working meal.

545
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,640
Then continue.

546
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,520
This is a working meal.

547
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,200
This is a working meal.

548
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,480
Yes.

549
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,600
Such a lavish working meal.

550
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,680
We're here to record a show.

551
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,360
You all will go back to the set having gained weight, right?

552
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,800
Yes.

553
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,760
I want to eat steamed buns.

554
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,920
Can you pass me that plate of steamed buns?

555
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,880
You're like Sun Wukong.

556
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,600
That sound just now.

557
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,600
About ten minutes to eat is enough, right?

558
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,160
That's about right.

559
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,640
That's about right.

560
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,920
No need to put them on the table.

561
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,800
Just put them all right here.

562
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,560
Just leave them in the car.

563
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,120
Just move the ones underneath to the top.

564
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
I like eating this.

565
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,440
Me too.

566
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
I love steamed corn buns the most.

567
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,120
Inside this,

568
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
should we stuff something inside?

569
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,920
I think so.

570
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,320
There’s a kind of filling.

571
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,840
That filling, right?

572
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,080
Is it that "Hong San Duo" thing?

573
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,640
This one?

574
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,200
Actually, you can put anything in.

575
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah.

576
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,640
Put this in that bowl.

577
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,280
That works.

578
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,640
Right?

579
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,680
This can be stuffed in.

580
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,440
Yeah, it really is this.

581
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
This is so delicious.

582
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
I want to get some more of this.

583
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,160
And rice—who wants rice?

584
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Me.

585
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,040
Just you?

586
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,160
Then you just

587
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,080
take this big bowl.

588
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,520
There’s also chicken bones.

589
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,840
A perfect day.

590
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,480
Can we have a quick chat?

591
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,120
Just a quick chat, nothing too deep.

592
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,800
Don’t argue now.

593
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Don’t argue.

594
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
Don’t fight.

595
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,160
We have to fight.

596
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,320
Who are you talking about now?

597
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,200
I was looking at you when I said it, it’s obvious.

598
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,880
It’s targeted.

599
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,360
Is that enough?

600
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,160
Which one are you asking if it's enough?

601
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,520
Rice—aren't you going to eat rice?

602
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,320
I know, it's just—

603
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,000
You're serving me rice.

604
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,600
What did you think I was doing?

605
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Thank you.

606
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,720
Your father entrusted you to me.

607
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,800
Chopsticks—here, you all.

608
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,880
Chicken stewed with mushrooms.

609
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,000
That's a northeastern dish, that is.

610
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,400
Thanks.

611
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
Chicken stewed with mushrooms—that one.

612
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,600
That's right.

613
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
Looks great at first glance.

614
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,480
Do you have any ideas yet?

615
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,920
What ideas do you have?

616
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,480
Any ideas?

617
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,840
We just reconstructed the story, and you already have ideas?

618
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,160
If you already have ideas, I think that's a big problem.

619
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,400
Go ahead, tell us.

620
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,760
It's me.

621
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,840
It's you.

622
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,680
Okay.

623
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,280
Anyway, everyone has a motive.

624
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,520
Yeah.

625
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
And they're all pretty strong today.

626
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,440
Right.

627
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,160
Actually, the strongest motives are you two.

628
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,240
No, you three.

629
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Wait, that's not right.

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,240
You have a strong motive too.

631
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,600
You also have a vendetta for your father's death.

632
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,240
We already said "killed."

633
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,320
My father isn't dead.

634
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,040
Niu Da is your father.

635
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,760
He's not dead.

636
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,480
You must have thought he was dead.

637
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,040
His father is that Ren.

638
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
No, I know.

639
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,760
Niu Da isn't dead.

640
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
Niu Da turned into a glowing person.

641
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
But your dad ended up like this because of him.

642
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,200
He did experiments on him and made him like this.

643
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,040
So you would hate him too.

644
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,360
But you definitely have a motive.

645
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,760
It's Niu Da's father.

646
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,320
As for motives,

647
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,200
I don't think we can rule people out just by motive.

648
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Today is just about motives.

649
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,880
Explaining how evil this person is.

650
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,080
Yeah.

651
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,160
But it's not really useful.

652
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,040
We can't rule people out by motive.

653
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,320
Right.

654
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,600
So just vote for whoever hates the most?

655
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,080
Everyone has a strong motive.

656
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
They're all strong.

657
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,480
Yeah, unless someone has a really weak motive.

658
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
Then we can rule them out.

659
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,840
Mine is really weak, so you can rule me out.

660
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,680
It's you.

661
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,400
Yes, it's me.

662
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,880
So you're excluding me, right?

663
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
Thanks.

664
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,840
I wouldn't say excluded.

665
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,920
Just that your suspicion is a bit lower.

666
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,520
But you can't be ruled out.

667
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,200
That's right.

668
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,680
Let me tell you.

669
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,800
You might win three times in a row.

670
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,680
Listen, Lao Bai.

671
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
I was thinking about this yesterday.

672
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
Would the production team

673
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,120
make it so it's "Bai" three episodes in a row?

674
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,080
Actually,

675
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,680
it's very possible.

676
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,200
We were asking about this yesterday.

677
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,280
No one would be able to guess that.

678
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
No, because last season with He,

679
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,720
he won three times in a row at the end.

680
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah.

681
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,320
Really.

682
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,120
Yeah, did you forget?

683
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,880
At the end,

684
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,080
the robot and the last one—

685
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,840
Did you win two or three times?

686
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,520
Imitating my dad killing someone.

687
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,960
Two in a row, then I was X in one episode.

688
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,560
So,

689
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,400
let's just vote for him today.

690
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,840
No more overthinking.

691
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
You're really suspicious today.

692
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,680
Because from my perspective,

693
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,520
you two are the most likely this episode.

694
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,360
The two of us?

695
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
I'm willing to sacrifice for the group.

696
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's just do it—vote right after we eat.

697
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,920
For everyone's flight,

698
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,600
I'll vote for you.

699
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
Then I can fly this afternoon.

700
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,560
Right.

701
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
If you don't put in a bit more effort,

702
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
You bring the plane over.

703
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,920
I even brought the plane over.

704
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
Then let's do this show.

705
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
Then it won't be called "Let's Start Reasoning".

706
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Let's just call it "Start".

707
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
Let's vote.

708
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,520
Let's start voting.

709
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Start voting.

710
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,880
No.

711
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,080
Jin Jing is.

712
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,760
She's pretty good at playing Werewolf.

713
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,920
So in the final stage,

714
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
you have a big advantage.

715
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,920
Today, the two of us

716
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,600
really need to work together calmly.

717
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,240
Of course I agree with your suggestion.

718
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,360
But I still want to see your

719
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
story later on.

720
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,040
Today, you

721
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,600
almost couldn't hold back just now.

722
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,680
What?

723
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,720
I mean your composure.

724
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,360
Towards whom?

725
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,840
Towards him.

726
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,080
I can't control my lack of composure with him.

727
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,880
I can't control my lack of composure with him.

728
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,840
I just can't hold it in.

729
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,560
It's okay.

730
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,200
No matter how you treat me,

731
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
I still love you very much.

732
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,320
No matter how you treat me,

733
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,600
I still love you very much.

734
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,520
Such a heartfelt confession.

735
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
He's trying to confuse me.

736
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
This is really delicious.

737
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Deduction

738
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,720
This deduction is quite enjoyable.

739
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Let's organize the big picture.

740
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What did I say?

741
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,040
Now we probably know the backgrounds of a few of us.

742
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,880
We all know them.

743
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Our own stories.

744
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,400
Even the motives for murder have come out.

745
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
So what we need to do now

746
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,840
is actually very simple.

747
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,160
What is it?

748
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
We just need to summarize

749
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,520
what we just discovered.

750
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,160
That's all.

751
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,760
There's another thing I think is quite crucial.

752
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
We're all kids from the island.

753
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
But he

754
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,080
Who isn't?

755
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,720
You still are.

756
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm not a kid from the island.

757
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,560
So you're the only one who isn't.

758
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,720
No, it's just that all these people are connected to the island.

759
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,240
Right.

760
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah.

761
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm also an islander.

762
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,120
Your main issue is amnesia.

763
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,400
It's a bit complicated.

764
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,040
This is delicious.

765
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,000
What is this?

766
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Potato.

767
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,680
Three-combo.

768
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,520
Hot.

769
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,480
Thank you.

770
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Look at him being the younger brother.

771
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm the older brother.

772
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
What's the point of your amnesia, anyway?

773
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,320
Does it serve any crucial purpose?

774
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
I lose my memory once every six months.

775
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
His amnesia must be real.

776
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,760
Because I can prove his amnesia is real.

777
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,680
I mean, why did the writer give you amnesia?

778
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,640
I think it's just to give him an excuse.

779
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
Because he's always forgetting things.

780
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,360
You're making it personal.

781
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
That's just a personal attack.

782
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
Alright, alright.

783
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,480
Eat less, Glowing Guy will be here soon.

784
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,400
Don't spit it out.

785
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,520
Spit it out.

786
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,840
But it's daytime today.

787
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
How can Glowing Guy show up?

788
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,360
He'll appear as soon as we turn off the lights.

789
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,200
Once the lights are off, everyone looks the same.

790
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,720
What's wrong?

791
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,880
This squid is really delicious.

792
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,840
Sorry.

793
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,320
What's your favorite food?

794
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,080
Bullfrog.

795
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,000
Really?

796
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,640
Yeah, I like eating unusual things.

797
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,680
What's your favorite food?

798
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,640
What kind?

799
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,680
Fruit.

800
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,160
I mean a dish.

801
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
Yogurt curds.

802
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,280
A dish.

803
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
I keep seeing you recommend something.

804
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,080
Like beef jerky or something.

805
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,240
I never recommended beef jerky.

806
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,560
That's made up.

807
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,240
Did she recommend raisins?

808
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,520
No.

809
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,800
I didn't recommend raisins either.

810
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
It's beef jerky or something.

811
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,240
I always see her recommendations.

812
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,680
Like what she brings to shows.

813
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
There's that kind.

814
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,160
She always talks about yogurt curds anyway.

815
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah, I've seen yogurt curds.

816
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,920
Yogurt curds.

817
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,440
Aren't you eating anymore?

818
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
That time we went ice skating.

819
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,480
What were we skating on?

820
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,120
Roller skating.

821
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,480
Skating, right.

822
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,240
It's tasty.

823
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
His expression.

824
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,840
Looks like he's about to throw up.

825
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,480
Last time, there was another situation.

826
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
It was when we were both the killers.

827
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,720
High school.

828
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,440
High school.

829
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,320
Playing basketball.

830
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,160
The basketball one, right?

831
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,840
Two killers.

832
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,040
We were both the killers.

833
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,280
Was it season two or season one?

834
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,440
Season two.

835
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,400
Which case in season two?

836
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,480
High school, something like YPGY.

837
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,920
We won that round together.

838
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,200
The TYP one.

839
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,160
Winning this round felt so good.

840
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,280
Yeah, I remember now.

841
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,160
Yeah.

842
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,640
Double culprit.

843
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,680
Double culprit.

844
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,600
I totally forgot.

845
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,960
It was your first time coming.

846
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,560
You forgot everything.

847
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,880
Because you’ve done too many detective shows.

848
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
You shouldn’t do so many.

849
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,560
You should just focus on one.

850
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,640
Did we pick X that time?

851
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,040
Neither of us got the question right.

852
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,160
Yeah.

853
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,800
They just don’t give you those kinds of questions.

854
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,560
No, the two of us—

855
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,440
Neither of us got it right.

856
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,320
Neither of us answered.

857
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,800
And it was specifically set for the two of us.

858
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
As long as one of us answered, we could choose.

859
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,360
But neither of us answered.

860
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,760
I didn’t answer.

861
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,160
I thought for sure you’d get it.

862
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,360
But you didn’t either.

863
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
They gave us questions we couldn’t answer on purpose, right?

864
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,440
Yeah.

865
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,360
Probably, yeah.

866
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,000
That’s just—

867
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,080
Or maybe it’s just—

868
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,800
Maybe we’re just not that smart.

869
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,960
So we blame the show for making it too hard.

870
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,080
I just remembered why yesterday

871
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,920
I kept thinking I was the culprit

872
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,680
and didn't

873
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,720
You blame yourself so easily

874
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,680
didn't do any reasoning

875
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,400
because I wanted to play this game seriously

876
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,440
It's because I didn't choose X when I had the chance

877
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,120
If I had said I really wanted to pick X

878
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,280
he would have given me a really hard question

879
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
When you gave me a hint

880
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,720
If there were two culprits

881
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,680
he wouldn't be the culprit

882
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
they'd give you a tough question you couldn't answer

883
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,920
At that moment, I'd have a sudden realization

884
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
But unfortunately, I actually

885
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,560
I think you were too bold

886
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Yesterday, you were a bit

887
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,200
You played really unpredictably yesterday

888
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,120
You didn't even pick X

889
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,360
Mainly because I was convinced

890
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,680
that I was the culprit

891
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Yes, you thought you were the culprit

892
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,440
But not picking X was actually pretty unexpected

893
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,760
Do you know why I didn't pick X?

894
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,640
Because the two of them

895
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,200
I wanted them to play as good guys

896
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,960
I was afraid they'd feel burdened if they had to carry something

897
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,600
You know?

898
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
That was kind of kind-hearted

899
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah

900
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
I just think my younger brother is easily

901
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,720
If you pick him as X

902
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,160
he gets nervous or something

903
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,080
I just wanted them

904
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
They've played for three seasons

905
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,120
At the time, I just thought

906
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,680
Do you think

907
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,600
Do you think he would?

908
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
I didn't pick my younger brother as X

909
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,240
Why did he get so nervous like that?

910
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,920
I want to tell you something.

911
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,320
What is it?

912
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,160
For example, take him.

913
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
This is his third season recording this show.

914
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
So there's no need to go easy on him, just make your choice.

915
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,080
Yeah, just make your choice.

916
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,560
No need to go easy on him, right.

917
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,440
No, I'm not going easy on him either.

918
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,200
I just think it's more fun this way.

919
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,240
What if both of you are too relaxed?

920
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,200
And then you keep saying, "I'm really not X."

921
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
"I'm really not X."

922
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,760
"I don't have X."

923
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,160
That's really entertaining.

924
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,000
The most fun part yesterday was

925
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,880
your inner thoughts.

926
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,560
No, if you want to play it that way,

927
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,760
then you have to stir up

928
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
a debate between those two.

929
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,320
Right.

930
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,480
Just say, "You're X."

931
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,040
I didn't even have time to stir things up.

932
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,600
I was completely focused on you.

933
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,680
But when you came back, what I meant was

934
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,360
no matter how much we pressured you at the time,

935
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,120
you still wouldn't reveal yourself, right?

936
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,280
I think that part could also be

937
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,520
the reason why he didn't step forward.

938
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,200
Because he didn't understand it himself.

939
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
No, I understood.

940
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,320
I understood everything.

941
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,120
Because, no—

942
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,520
Because I knew I was the one who killed the person.

943
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
I poisoned them.

944
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,120
You were sure about that.

945
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,320
But the direction you all are taking now

946
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,280
is wrong.

947
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,360
If someone figures it out later,

948
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
they'll realize, "No, it shouldn't be this."

949
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,360
If it is this,

950
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,080
then if I step forward, wouldn't I...

951
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,560
The white piece jumped.

952
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,800
Right, wouldn't that just mean death?

953
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,280
Yeah, because I know he is—

954
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
He can't jump, he really can't.

955
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,720
Yesterday, he shouldn't have jumped, you should have.

956
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,440
Can't jump.

957
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Only you can jump.

958
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,080
He really can't jump.

959
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
Because maybe our earlier point

960
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,000
wasn't clearly sorted out.

961
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,240
The idea that he died before seven o'clock.

962
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Right.

963
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,760
But actually, in that moment,

964
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,920
if I were you,

965
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
I don't think I could react in time either.

966
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,560
I'm going to jump.

967
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,200
Yeah.

968
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,720
Right.

969
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,920
If I just jumped right here,

970
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,520
then after you, it's over—no, that's not right.

971
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,280
If you say it again,

972
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,120
it's over.

973
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,440
It's over.

974
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
That's solid evidence.

975
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,200
That's direct proof.

976
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,920
That would be exciting.

977
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,720
Let's see how you argue your way out.

978
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,880
There's no way to argue anymore.

979
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,800
Argue, argue to the end, you have to argue.

980
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,720
There's no way to argue anymore.

981
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
Who are you doing this for?

982
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,320
Of course, for the beautiful princess—you.

983
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,720
Make one for me.

984
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Why should I make one for you?

985
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I want to eat one. Make a small one.

986
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,360
Can't you make it yourself?

987
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,720
No, I can't.

988
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,040
You're clumsy.

989
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
Yeah.

990
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,240
And dumb.

991
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,880
Yeah.

992
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,560
What else are you?

993
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm messed up everywhere.

994
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,000
That's why I need you to take care of me.

995
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,560
Okay.

996
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,400
No problem.

997
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,240
I think you're the one who's messed up.

998
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,760
You're really something.

999
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,800
You really are afraid your blood sugar isn't high enough.

1000
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,400
Beautiful princess.

1001
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm afraid you'll faint.

1002
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,160
Beautiful princess.

1003
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
I made one for you.

1004
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,320
Thank you.

1005
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
It looks so wilted.

1006
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,760
Don't eat it. Who knows if it's clean.

1007
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,480
How do you make this?

1008
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,639
First, heat it up.

1009
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,360
And then?

1010
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,080
Then, as the temperature slowly rises,

1011
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,239
The temperature isn't right yet.

1012
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,199
Once it's hot enough, threads will form around the edges.

1013
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,280
Then you just...

1014
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,520
Wrap it like this.

1015
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,960
Like this?

1016
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,280
Yeah, just wrap it like this.

1017
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm not very good at it either.

1018
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,360
Not bad, right?

1019
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,480
I want to.

1020
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,679
Let me have a bite.

1021
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,159
Let me have a bite.

1022
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,880
If you want to eat, eat it all.

1023
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Another bite.

1024
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,280
I ate it.

1025
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,159
Then I can't finish it.

1026
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
Tear it with your hands.

1027
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,880
Go ahead and tear it.

1028
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,920
But I'm afraid I'll get it on your hair.

1029
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
Move all your hair, yeah.

1030
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,280
Okay.

1031
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,040
Thank you.

1032
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Where's the bomb?

1033
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,680
Isn't that a bomb?

1034
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,280
Yeah.

1035
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Could this be a bomb?

1036
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
A pack of explosives.

1037
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,280
Wait a second.

1038
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,880
Careful, it might explode.

1039
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,880
No, it won't.

1040
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,720
It really won't explode.

1041
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
Is this a bomb?

1042
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,400
A bomb.

1043
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,480
It obviously looks like a bomb.

1044
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,000
A bomb is just like an idiot.

1045
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Idiot.

1046
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,280
You can tell at a glance.

1047
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,600
A princess is obviously a princess.

1048
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,200
Hurry, look for it.

1049
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,040
What is this?

1050
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,280
This is my gun.

1051
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
Why is it here?

1052
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,840
No idea.

1053
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,840
What is this?

1054
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,520
Found it!

1055
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Wait, is this a speaker?

1056
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,680
This is a battery.

1057
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,440
A battery.

1058
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,560
We can't find the key evidence.

1059
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
We still can't find the bomb.

1060
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,320
We're completely useless.

1061
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm telling you,

1062
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
we can't find anything.

1063
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,920
We can't find the killer either.

1064
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,600
Or we could just escape now.

1065
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Then we won't get blown up, right?

1066
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,320
Yeah, let's run.

1067
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,200
No, we need to—

1068
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,880
If this thing explodes, it's an atomic bomb.

1069
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,000
The whole Earth will be destroyed.

1070
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,880
That's what I mean.

1071
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
Let's hurry and drive.

1072
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,800
Drive where?

1073
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,880
To Mars.

1074
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,040
Drive to Jinhua first.

1075
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,120
Then take that train.

1076
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,000
Back to Hengdian.

1077
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,800
You'd better bring two Jinhua hams for your director.

1078
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,640
Like this.

1079
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,200
Let's search again, okay?

1080
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,520
Let's search around the ship.

1081
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
Let's not miss any spots.

1082
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Just search on the ship.

1083
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,920
Is there anything on the lower level?

1084
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,640
No.

1085
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,320
Open the sack.

1086
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,200
Open the sack.

1087
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,000
No bomb.

1088
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,800
No.

1089
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,680
No, really, there's nothing.

1090
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,880
How could we not find the first one?

1091
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,120
Shouldn't the first one be the easiest?

1092
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,080
I even crawled into its sail.

1093
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,480
Look.

1094
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
Is there anything on that pole?

1095
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,840
Who brought it?

1096
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,200
Your legs are so long.

1097
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,000
It's just because I pulled my pants up high.

1098
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
There's really nothing.

1099
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,840
No, I give up.

1100
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Tell us where it is.

1101
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,760
Come on, where is it?

1102
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
At the reception desk.

1103
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm really speechless.

1104
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,480
Seriously speechless.

1105
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
I actually went in there just now.

1106
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,320
Where is it?

1107
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,400
Behind the swim ring.

1108
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,480
What?

1109
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,680
Are you kidding?

1110
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
Wow, that's cool.

1111
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Cool, beautiful.

1112
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm honestly speechless.

1113
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,560
It looks great.

1114
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,560
Three, two, one

1115
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,200
So beautiful

1116
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,200
And turn around once

1117
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:58,920
Come on

1118
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Looking cool, that's good

1119
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,080
But I still prefer that one

1120
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,520
You should ride up on this

1121
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
How do you ride this?

1122
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,720
Yes, just get on like that

1123
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,800
How come they all have horses?

1124
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,880
Why are there wheels too?

1125
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,080
His horse

1126
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,960
Can't fly

1127
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,760
If you go faster, won't it fly?

1128
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,280
Do I have my own?

1129
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Because I can't share a dressing room with others

1130
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,080
So many quirks

1131
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,280
Take the poster photo

1132
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
Lower the height a little

1133
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,280
Okay, that's fine
