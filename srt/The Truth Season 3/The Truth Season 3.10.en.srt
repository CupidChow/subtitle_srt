1
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
There's been a murder.

2
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,600
Boss.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,640
So actually, this is a livestreaming business.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,920
We're not really making candy here or anything.

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,960
Our factory is just a front.

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,240
This is a livestreaming factory.

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,520
You scared me to death.
You startled me.

8
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,760
That's the person.

9
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm Tan Qian's investor.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
But I didn't expect

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
that he would actually die.

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Starting today,

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,200
I'll be taking over this Tuitian Food Factory.

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,840
That means I'm your boss now.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
You can call me President An.

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
So this livestreaming business is yours now.

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
Everyone, don't worry.

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,160
Whatever Tan Qian did before,

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,479
I knew nothing about it.

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
But I will shut down the factory's livestream.

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll also organize all the related documents.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,760
And put them in the secret room.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,800
Until I get to the bottom of Tan Qian's situation,

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,920
before the investigation is complete,

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,120
no one is allowed to leave here.

26
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Is anyone there?

27
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
Wake up.

28
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,400
What

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
What's going on

30
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Big Brother Ning

31
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,480
Brother Ning
Ning the Third Wheel

32
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Aren't we in the dormitory?

33
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
No, how is this...

34
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,959
Sister

35
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,320
Younger brother

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,360
Younger brother
Sister

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Sister, save me! Sister!

38
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Sister, save me!

39
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
Why is someone standing up?

40
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,960
Wait a moment.

41
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,640
You don't have to do that, just drag it over.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Isn't this way fine for you?

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,080
Look, there's a pair of scissors.

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,200
There's a pair of scissors over there.

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,520
Really?
This...

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,760
Yeah, this.
This.

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,160
Your legs are so long.

48
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Here.

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,600
It's untied.
Yeah.

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,680
Impressive.
So fast.

51
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,960
Quick.
Who else?

52
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,600
You scared me.

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
What is this you guys have?

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,760
This is an anti-lost rope.

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
This is because of yesterday.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Didn't I kill someone?

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
And then didn't she take me with her?

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,800
I need to keep an eye on her.

59
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,440
Cut it open, go ahead and cut it.

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,520
Okay.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
Why were we brought here?

62
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
Wait, weren’t we supposed to be handcuffed together?

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah.

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,440
Electrical leakage hazard detected in the circuit

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
This may cause a fire

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
Please follow the emergency exit route

67
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,200
Fire
Evacuate immediately

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Emergency exit
This way

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,200
Go

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,400
Where is the emergency exit?
The emergency exit is ahead

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
Hurry, run a bit

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,160
That scared me to death.

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,280
What is it?
A power line.

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,280
What an exciting feeling.

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,320
What's happening outside?
I don't dare to go.

76
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
Someone's knocking on the door.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Open the door.
Help!

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
Be careful.

79
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
Someone's knocking on the door.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,080
Go.
Open the door.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,000
No, kick it.
Kick—three, two, one.

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Kick it.

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,640
On the ground.
Be careful.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,560
Watch out, there's something on the ground.

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
There's someone on the ground.
There's someone here.

86
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,520
Who is this?

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,640
Who died here?

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,800
Power tripped due to a short circuit.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
Backup power has been activated.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,200
Who is this?

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
Who is this? This is...

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,960
This is An...

93
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,680
An Wenzhe.

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
An Wenzhe is dead.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120
"Let's Start Reasoning"

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,880
The second case of season three officially begins.

97
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
It is now February 26, 2025.

98
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
8:05

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,720
8:05

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
The victim in this case is An Wenzhe.

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,480
After a preliminary investigation,

102
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,440
the suspect who killed him has been narrowed down to

103
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Bai Hanzi

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,120
Ning Dengpao

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,080
Heniba

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,560
Ke'an looks at the four people.

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Jin Tangshao and Ba Fentang

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Because they were together last night,

109
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,480
they can vouch for each other and are cleared of suspicion.

110
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,320
So tonight,

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,920
I'll be the one to watch over this "little troublemaker."

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Come with me.

113
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,440
Therefore, you are the detectives for this case.

114
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,760
Now, detectives, please take the suspect

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
and start the investigation.

116
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,760
Let's talk about

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
each person's relationship with him.

118
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,640
No connection.
I don't know him either.

119
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,400
I don't know him either.
We're all the same.

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,360
Yes, that's right.

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,280
I don't know him.

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,320
I only knew Tan Qian before.

123
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,240
I met this guy for the first time yesterday.

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,520
You didn't know him, so you didn't stop him when he ran that day?

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Right.

126
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,360
No, what kind of logic is that, man?

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,880
So that's what our statements are for now.

128
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll remember that.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,360
If I catch anyone lying,

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll immediately lock onto the culprit.

131
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,240
Don't bite your tongue, speak more slowly.

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Immediately lock onto the culprit.

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
Alright, search him first.

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,840
See if he has anything on him.

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait a second.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
What's with his hand?

137
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,160
Is he trying to pull this?

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Second floor live streaming area

139
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
Sprinkler system control switch

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,799
There was a fire inside just now

141
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,240
A fire

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,360
A fire, right?
Right

143
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,840
If there's a fire, the sprinkler system will activate

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,760
When we came out

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,000
The power was already cut off

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,880
We started getting electrocuted

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,920
So if

148
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
the sprinkler system had just turned on
That's right

149
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,160
we would have been electrocuted

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,400
Okay, search him

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
His clothes are so wet

152
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
He's wet.

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,760
His name is Tui Youfu.

154
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
The one in black is Boss An Wenzhe.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,560
You can call me President An.

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,640
His name is Tui Youfu.

157
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,480
Tui Youfu.

158
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,840
And this is his...

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,880
subsidy receipt for low-income families.

160
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,640
But there's a question.
If he is that...

161
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
An Wenzhe.

162
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,920
He said he donated five million.

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm Tan Qian's investor.

164
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,440
I invested five million in him.

165
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
On February 20, 2025,

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,800
he still didn't have any money.

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,840
Right.

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Where did the five million come from?

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Right.

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,920
And he also had this in his pocket.

171
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,800
Herbal sedative.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,960
After lighting it, inhale the smoke.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
That's all it takes.

174
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,000
It causes about six hours of drowsiness.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
So were we knocked out by this?

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,680
He came to knock us out, right?

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
Right, that's why we were tied up.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
What time is it now?
It's eight o'clock now.

179
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
About six hours of drowsiness.

180
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,520
Have we already reached

181
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,880
that
six-hour mark?

182
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,200
Then we woke up.
That's right.

183
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,680
It's possible.

184
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
We must have passed out at two o'clock.

185
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,960
I think all of us in here

186
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,640
were tied up.

187
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,680
Being tied to the chairs is our alibi.

188
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes, someone snuck back in.

189
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,680
Pretend to wake up.

190
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,880
Then tie themselves up again.

191
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
Right.

192
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
Didn't you notice?

193
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Was ours just now really loose?

194
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Ask him, mine was really loose.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
Mine was really loose.

196
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,560
What?

197
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,640
Yours was loose?

198
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,720
I feel like I saw what you'll look like when you're old.

199
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Just now.

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
We need more evidence.

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
Now, one by one,

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,120
we'll search the rooms of you suspects.

203
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,400
Let's go.

204
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Do we go this way?

205
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Yes, this way.

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Little killer.

207
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Stop pretending.

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
You're starting again.
The moment I woke up,

209
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
I realized you were the killer.

210
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
You're starting again.

211
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
Let's go, head to Heniba first.

212
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
You look like the dorm supervisor now.

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Which one?

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
You don't look like a detective at all.

215
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,760
Which room?

216
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,360
Open the door for me.

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
The two of us share a room.

218
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,520
Didn't we already search here?

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,720
He must have new evidence.

220
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay.

221
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,280
Evidence about him from last night.

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
Come on, everyone, get moving.

223
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,280
A phone, right?
What is this thing?

224
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Explain it, please.

225
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
There's a note here.

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
There's a note inside the glove.

227
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
There's nothing else, right?

228
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,840
That's all.

229
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,440
Let's go through them one by one.

230
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,600
Detective

231
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
You are the one who shines into my

232
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,520
dark life like a ray of light.

233
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
I won't stop until my deep grudge is avenged.

234
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,560
Little Frog

235
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,320
Died in a construction site fall.

236
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Who is Little Frog?

237
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,840
You have a girlfriend now.

238
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,640
Wait, there's one more recording.

239
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,480
Master, it's Xiao He.

240
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,360
Xiao He, how have you been lately?

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,640
That person finally showed up.

242
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,360
What does he look like?

243
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
He's about 1.85 meters tall.

244
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,680
Thick eyebrows and big eyes.

245
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
A straight nose bridge.

246
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
There's a mole slightly to the left.

247
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
I have a mole slightly to the left too.

248
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
But the one with thick eyebrows and big eyes isn't me.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Take a look at An Wenzhe's ID card.

250
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,520
This—

251
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,240
It says there's a mole slightly to the left.

252
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,720
On the bridge of the nose.

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
There is—it's him.

254
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
So you had someone investigate him.

255
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,960
This person finally told you where he is.

256
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,640
Then, to avenge Little Frog,

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,000
you killed him.

258
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
That little frog isn't my girlfriend.

259
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Wasn't I deep in debt two years ago?

260
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
Owing money to loan sharks?

261
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,120
So I went to work at a construction site.

262
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,680
Then can you explain something?

263
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
You used to work construction,

264
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
so how can you dress so well now?

265
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
Do you know what I've been through these past three years?

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,560
You guys don't know?
No, we don't.

267
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,280
I've made so many investments.

268
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,040
I usually take some people from the factory

269
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,240
to make some investments.

270
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,960
Over time,

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,400
I became a small-time dealer.

272
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,240
You're a dealer?

273
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,280
You—

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
That's impressive.

275
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
Then one day,

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,520
I was moving bricks.

277
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,600
From the scaffolding next to me,

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
a woman fell down.

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,680
It was Little Frog.

280
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,280
She died right next to me.

281
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,480
I was really scared.

282
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,080
Because I thought

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,600
that area was my responsibility.

284
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,680
If someone fell, I would be held accountable.

285
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,560
So I dropped my work and ran away.

286
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,360
But afterwards, no one came

287
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,240
to hold me responsible.

288
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,960
Later, I came to this place.

289
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,720
And then,

290
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,360
when we went to the livestream room yesterday,

291
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
I suddenly noticed

292
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,600
there was a rabbit like this on the table.

293
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,000
What is this?

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,400
This rabbit was mine back then

295
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,120
When I saw that girl fall,

296
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
a rabbit fell from her as well.

297
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,080
Because this rabbit has a mark

298
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,920
It has "XQW" on it

299
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,680
That stands for Little Frog

300
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,080
So I recognized it

301
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,400
This rabbit must be that

302
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,640
little frog girl's.

303
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,960
I just find it strange why

304
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,040
something from two years ago would show up here.

305
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
That made me think of An Wenzhe.

306
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,400
He said he would organize all the factory's documents

307
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,440
and have everything sorted out.

308
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,760
I'll organize all the relevant information.

309
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,560
Put it in the secret room.

310
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,360
I wanted to check the materials he organized

311
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,400
to see if there were any clues that could explain

312
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,640
why the little frog's belongings

313
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
ended up in the livestream room.

314
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
So I went into the secret room.

315
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
I saw his suitcase there.

316
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,080
His suitcase was locked and couldn't be opened.

317
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
But this piece of paper

318
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
was sticking out from the suitcase.

319
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,000
I tore it off and got half a sheet.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,080
I discovered An Wenzhe.

321
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
He was looking for this little girl.

322
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,520
Then I got really nervous.

323
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
I was afraid An Wenzhe was here to kill me.

324
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,360
So I called my mentor.

325
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
Our company doesn't allow us to have phones, right?

326
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,600
Where did you get the call from?

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,960
The boss is already dead.

328
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
But now that the boss is dead, it doesn't matter anymore.

329
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
Then I asked the old master,

330
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
if anyone in the past two years

331
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
had come to the construction site looking for me.

332
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
The old master described it to me.

333
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,200
He said yes.
It was An Wenzhe.

334
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,360
Later, while I was in bed,

335
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
I became very scared.

336
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,200
Scared.

337
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,720
I was afraid of An Wenzhe.

338
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,680
I was afraid An Wenzhe would come

339
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,120
for revenge.
To get revenge.

340
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,040
So you set everything up to kill him instead.

341
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,400
I was already this scared.

342
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,840
Then I got so scared, I fell asleep.

343
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,320
You really were scared.

344
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,680
Indeed.

345
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
What grudge does he have against you?

346
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Mainly, it's what he said.

347
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
He said he wouldn't stop until he avenged his deep grudge.

348
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
He clearly came for revenge.

349
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
Was it just fear?

350
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
That's right, yes.

351
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,560
Okay.

352
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
That's a bit suspicious.

353
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,160
So can this confirm his motive for murder?

354
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
I think it can.

355
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
You can't just want to kill someone because you're scared.

356
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,280
Because he said he was scared.

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,240
But he changed into such a nice suit.

358
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,840
Who could, in a state of extreme fear,

359
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,440
still iron a suit and change into it?

360
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
And even add a bit of red to his hair.

361
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,400
Added a bit of red.

362
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,960
The culprit is locked in.

363
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,200
That makes a lot of sense.

364
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,960
You can't escape today.

365
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,400
I suddenly feel like

366
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
there's some logic to this.

367
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,520
Next, please.
Okay, next one, come on.

368
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,520
Who's next?

369
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
Where's that box?

370
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,760
There's a computer on top.

371
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,200
Let's take a look at this laptop.

372
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,880
Who is it?

373
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,599
The cover shows Boss An.

374
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,119
An Wenzhe.

375
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,480
An Wenzhe's computer

376
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,079
What does this sign mean?

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,880
You can enter it, right?

378
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
Why do you have An Wenzhe's computer?

379
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,240
This is how I got this computer.

380
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,040
Let me tell you how it came to be.

381
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,400
So,

382
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,760
after finishing the last case,

383
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,960
I came back that night.

384
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,880
I still wanted to go into his room

385
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
to find that breach of contract I had.

386
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,240
I wanted to get it out.

387
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,560
I wanted to destroy that contract.

388
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
So, while I was on duty, I secretly

389
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,960
brought my phone with me.

390
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
At that time, the boss

391
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,600
thought I was recording a video.

392
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,960
If you want to play professionally at the club,

393
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
as a player,

394
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,400
you can't have any personal legal disputes.

395
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
I was afraid I still wouldn't be able to get in

396
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,560
to that esports club.

397
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,920
So,
when no one was around,

398
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
I snuck into his room.

399
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,200
I went to look for the contract.

400
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,160
But I couldn't find it.

401
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
Then I went into his secret room.

402
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,640
Still couldn't find it.

403
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,160
But I found this laptop.

404
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
I entered my own birthday as the password.

405
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,480
And then I saw this.

406
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,720
What does that mean?

407
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
The building collapsed.

408
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,760
Falling from a building.
Someone pushed him.

409
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:10,960
Pushed down.
Burying the body.

410
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,240
Falling from a building.

411
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,320
Buried alive.

412
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800
Burned and drowned.

413
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes, that's right.

414
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,320
This was arranged by An Wenzhe.

415
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
For the four of you.

416
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
Ways to die.

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,080
What day is your birthday?

418
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,720
One eight.

419
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,040
Four ways to die

420
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,560
Yeah, after I saw this

421
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,680
I thought this person wanted to kill me

422
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Wants to kill you?

423
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,440
Yeah, and then I got really scared

424
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,080
and brought this notebook back with me

425
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,480
After I got back, to confirm

426
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,920
whether he really wanted to kill me

427
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,360
I specifically went to check
our workshop's main door

428
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,560
and the back door of our factory

429
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,560
Then I found that all the doors were locked

430
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,200
I thought he wanted to trap me here

431
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,120
and slaughter me

432
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
So I got really scared

433
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,920
What time did you go?

434
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,600
I went between (  )15 and 30

435
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,480
So after you came back?

436
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
Who are you?

437
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm here to interrogate. Who are you?

438
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,360
If you want to question anyone, tell me first. I'll do the asking.

439
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,960
Let's take her

440
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't bite your tongue

441
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
Let's put her under the bed

442
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
Then we'll first

443
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,960
lock her in, and investigate ourselves

444
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,720
Is that okay? Does that work?

445
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,800
In the end, I was still scared.

446
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,320
I came back feeling afraid.
Fell asleep.

447
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah.

448
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,720
Our whole dorm fell asleep feeling scared.

449
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,440
We were really scared.
Okay.

450
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,920
That was way too fast.

451
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,720
Just one clue.

452
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
Exactly.

453
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,080
Alright, let's move on to the next person.

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
You’re making yourself look more suspicious.

455
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
You two, stop fighting.

456
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Emergency situation.

457
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,440
Everyone, please go to the boss’s secret room immediately.

458
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
Enter the teleportation pod.

459
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,040
Enter the boss’s secret room teleportation pod.

460
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,600
Hurry.

461
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,040
Quickly.

462
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,280
Right now.

463
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,160
Hurry up.

464
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
Press it.

465
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,040
Is it okay?

466
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,600
There’s someone here.
Someone’s here.

467
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,280
I don’t dare to look.

468
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,480
No one.

469
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,640
There's absolutely no one here.

470
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Who's scaring themselves here?

471
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,680
What are you doing, getting startled like that?

472
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,360
Don't stand next to me.

473
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
I get scared when you're next to me.

474
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,240
Received the boss's key.

475
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,560
This delivery will follow the original route.

476
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:34,920
Received.

477
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Please proceed to the limited live room.

478
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Limited live room.

479
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
Limited live room.

480
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,720
We're finally going.

481
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,440
Being popular here isn't necessarily a good thing.

482
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,600
Once you enter the limited live room, there's no more news.

483
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,040
If you're too popular, you'll be taken away.

484
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,520
I want to change into my black and gold outfit.

485
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,920
Ning, aren't you supposed to be brave? Come on.

486
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,760
Ning the Brave, be brave now.

487
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,640
That's right, it's me.

488
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,360
We're here.

489
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,000
Wait, don't make me go last.

490
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,240
Boss Lady
Scar Bro

491
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,960
Let's roast a sweet potato.

492
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,720
What's this?

493
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,160
Violence

494
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
Invasion of privacy

495
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,600
Spreading rumors

496
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,760
Greed

497
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Incitement

498
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Welcome, Player 13: Heniba

499
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Player 17: Bafentang

500
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,160
Player 26: Bai Huanzi

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,720
Player 27: Ning Dengpao

502
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,120
Player 34: Jin Tangshao

503
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,680
Player 37: Ke Ankan

504
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,840
The sixth limited-time killing livestream is about to begin.

505
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,960
Killing livestream

506
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,160
Who will be lucky enough to survive until the end?

507
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,040
Let's wait and see.

508
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,040
What does that mean? What are we supposed to do?

509
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,240
He said it's a live killing broadcast.

510
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,600
Let's see who can survive until the end.

511
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
We have to fight each other.

512
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,600
Look.

513
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,040
Incitement

514
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
What about greed?

515
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,480
It turned into a viper.

516
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,600
Is this real?

517
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,920
A real snake.

518
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,040
A real snake.

519
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,680
It almost bit you.

520
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,360
You're fierce, little one.

521
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,720
But you're beautiful.

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,320
What is this?

523
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,440
Spreading rumors

524
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,320
Spit, right?

525
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,640
Violence

526
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
Stabbing, stabbing in the heart

527
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,040
What about this?
This is scary.

528
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
This won't explode, will it?

529
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,480
Eyeball explosion

530
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Eyeball explosion

531
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,120
Next, let's see

532
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,240
who can become

533
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,880
the top supporter who decides their fate.

534
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,160
Who can become our top supporter?

535
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
Why was there suddenly an extra livestream?

536
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,600
It's several days earlier than planned.

537
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,360
Sister Shehui is top supporter again.

538
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,480
I really want to be the top supporter and control others.

539
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,360
The top supporter can decide how they die.

540
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,760
Scar Bro is now the top supporter.

541
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,240
Congratulations, congratulations to Scar Bro.

542
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
Looking forward to what the top supporter will do.

543
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Choose an exciting challenge for them.

544
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,720
The top supporter has made their choice.

545
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
The game begins.

546
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,920
What did they choose?

547
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,040
Spreading rumors.
They chose "spreading rumors."

548
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Spreading rumors.

549
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,640
The door is open.

550
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,440
It's a whole new world inside.

551
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,840
It's green.

552
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,960
Is this sulfuric acid?

553
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
No, it's definitely water.

554
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,800
Saliva.

555
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,840
Can't we just rush through?

556
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,600
Let's observe first.

557
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,640
And also,
Is there more above?

558
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,240
There's nothing above.

559
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
So it's just these two groups.

560
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,760
Why don't you guys try rushing through?

561
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,800
Don't say you're coming.

562
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,240
Just go straight in.

563
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,960
You have to handle this thing—

564
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,320
See? That caught you off guard, didn't it?

565
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,800
Leave immediately.

566
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,680
Hurry up and go.

567
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,080
It's over, they've already become alert.

568
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,760
They just scattered right away.

569
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,440
You're something—you just charged straight ahead.

570
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,600
You didn't dodge at all.

571
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,680
It's really green.

572
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
She just didn't manage to dodge.

573
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
It's just like that kind of thing—

574
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,240
charging on the battlefield, dodging bullets.

575
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Then after it's over, you realize you're full of bullet holes.

576
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,440
We need to catch them off guard.

577
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
If you’ve got what it takes, don’t stop.

578
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,560
Back up.
Go back.

579
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,480
That's it, I won't let you pass.

580
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,200
Look at you.

581
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,160
Hesitate? Who made you hesitate?

582
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,600
I have a way.

583
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,760
Get the notebook.
Come here.

584
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,200
Help me block this.

585
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,560
Come on.
Three
Can't hold it back

586
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
No, if you try to block it, it'll burst all over us

587
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,560
Two, one

588
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,560
Actually, it can block it.

589
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,480
Saliva.

590
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,960
Let's go.

591
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,560
What is this place?

592
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,800
So damp.

593
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
The air is so humid.

594
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,560
Yeah.

595
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,800
Welcome to the Rumor Pool

596
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
What does it mean?

597
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,640
It's written underneath.

598
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Welcome to the Rumor Pool.

599
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,720
After spreading a rumor, you can find a way to escape.

600
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,560
Where is the exit?

601
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,720
It's above.

602
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,160
This is so exciting.

603
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,080
Really? It's above?

604
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,640
Yes, there's a hole.

605
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,280
There's a hole above.

606
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Then how do we get up there?

607
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,640
We have to be on this water surface

608
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,520
and piece together this path

609
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,960
then move forward

610
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,800
Let's go, come on

611
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,680
You

612
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,760
You try the depth first, don't rush

613
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,960
It's not deep

614
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,200
Really, it's not deep

615
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,440
It's a bit slippery
Be careful

616
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,200
It's very slippery

617
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,640
Your shoes are slippery

618
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,320
My shoes are really slippery, you guys be careful

619
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,800
Don't go down yet.

620
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,640
Yeah, don't go down.

621
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,880
We'll work on it down here.

622
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,040
You watch from above and help us.

623
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,080
Okay.

624
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,320
Yao.

625
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
Let's assemble that radical first.

626
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,320
This one, this is the "speech" radical, right?

627
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
What you have is a left-falling stroke.

628
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,360
This one?

629
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,240
Is this the left-falling stroke?
One left-falling stroke and one horizontal.

630
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,120
But it slants this way.

631
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,240
Rotate it counterclockwise.

632
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,320
Brother.
Yeah.

633
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,920
What are you doing?

634
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,360
The water is getting deeper.

635
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
Stop the water quickly!

636
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Hurry.

637
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,080
Quick.

638
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,120
Hurry, grab the stuff.

639
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,920
Don't.

640
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,560
Ignore it.

641
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,680
Leave it.

642
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
No need to take the clothes.

643
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
No need.

644
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,400
Don't worry about it.

645
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,480
Forget it.

646
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,520
Don't take the clothes.

647
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,280
Leave the clothes.

648
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,640
No, then whose is it?

649
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,520
That means we can't go back.

650
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,240
Let's give it our all first.

651
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,960
Come.

652
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm going into the frame.

653
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
Place the order first.

654
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,160
This won't do.
This is not acceptable.

655
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,440
Should we go down and help?

656
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,480
I want to ask

657
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,080
can you bring some up

658
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,920
and give them to us
so we can piece them together up here

659
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,320
Okay
Right
Hurry up

660
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,440
Give us a few

661
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,280
We just need to figure out what they are

662
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,840
Why does it feel like even the character "谣" is starting to seem

663
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
unfamiliar to me?

664
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,680
Is it this one here?

665
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,240
Like this?

666
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,760
This is the one with the "speech" radical, right?

667
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,840
Yes, the dot on the "speech" radical.

668
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,760
There's another dot.

669
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
There's a left-falling stroke here, does it look right?

670
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,040
No, it doesn't.

671
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,720
That's not it.

672
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Is it this one?

673
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,040
Yes, that's it! Found it.

674
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,560
That's the one, that's it!

675
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,720
What about yours? The one you just had?

676
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,680
Where's the vertical loop you just did?
The vertical one, this?

677
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,800
No, the "speech" radical.

678
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,080
I want a stroke like this.

679
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,200
Is it this one?

680
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,240
Yes.

681
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,760
Right.

682
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,040
Then find one that connects to it.

683
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
One that links up with it.

684
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,560
This one.

685
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,160
Yes, but the other way around.
This one.

686
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Yes.
That's right.

687
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
It will break this.

688
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,560
Put it over there.

689
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,400
Come on, move all the way to the left.

690
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,280
The water is getting deeper and deeper.

691
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah.

692
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,680
We need to hurry up.

693
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,040
Give me that one.

694
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,680
Which one? This one?
Yes.

695
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Found it.

696
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,520
Found this one.

697
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,360
Then set it aside.

698
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Like this.

699
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,320
This is the one on the bottom.
This is the one in the middle.

700
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,360
The one in the middle.

701
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,840
This.

702
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,560
Yes.
Then...

703
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,520
So...

704
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,000
This—there's one more.

705
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
This one.

706
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,800
This one goes on top, right?

707
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,880
It's this one.

708
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Then this one.

709
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,520
Below.

710
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Go further down, yes.

711
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,160
Yes, the very bottom, that's right.

712
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,520
This one is correct.

713
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,720
This one is right.

714
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No, that one isn't right.

715
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,680
Which one are you talking about?
The one before.

716
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
That one isn't there.

717
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
It's sealed.

718
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,600
That's right.

719
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,920
Here, right?

720
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes.

721
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,040
Here.

722
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,280
Here.

723
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
That's fine.

724
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,840
There's one more.

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Over there.

726
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,280
The bar behind you.

727
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
This one?

728
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,960
No, further back.

729
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,240
This one.
Yes, that's the one.

730
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,800
No, that's not it.
There's a black mark on this.

731
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,239
There's an extra corner.

732
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:14,719
No, that's not it.

733
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,719
There’s none left.
It’s gone.

734
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,960
There aren’t any of the thin ones left.

735
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,639
None of them are.

736
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,080
This one.

737
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,719
This one.

738
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,440
This one has a dot.

739
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,840
This one is a triangle.

740
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,679
Which one? This one?
Yes.

741
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,639
Bring it over.
Can it fit?

742
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
It's possible.

743
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,719
That's right.

744
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,560
Be careful on the stairs.

745
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,200
Then

746
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,240
There's a piece of paper, right?

747
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
Everyone, read according to the pinyin pronunciation.

748
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,200
Read the following content in full.

749
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,640
biā piā miā fiā

750
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,080
giào giào hià hià hià

751
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,960
Everyone reads.
Each person reads it once.

752
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,000
biā piā miā fiā

753
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,880
giào giào hià hià hià

754
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,200
biā piā miā fiā

755
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
giào giào hià hià hià

756
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
No.

757
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,400
What does this mean?

758
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,360
Yeah, why do we have to read this?

759
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
The door upstairs just opened.

760
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,560
The door is open.

761
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,080
The ladder has come down.

762
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,720
Do you have a ladder?

763
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,920
How do I get up there, bro?

764
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,720
We won't.

765
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,360
Are we supposed to carry someone up on our back?

766
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,640
I did think it might be this.

767
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,880
What are we doing here?

768
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,280
But how can we carry them when they're all wet?

769
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,560
He, we'll support you from below.

770
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,600
Here, like this.

771
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
You hold onto the wall first.

772
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,880
Each person takes a leg.
Ready, three

773
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,360
Ready, three
Two, one, go

774
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,240
Go
Three, two, one, go

775
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,400
A little higher this time

776
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,440
Pull-up

777
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
Impressive, this power.

778
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,600
Come on.

779
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,040
Are you serious?

780
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,840
Really.

781
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
Wait, aren't we...

782
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,760
Is that okay?

783
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,640
Of course they can.

784
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,360
Look around inside.
See if there's a ladder or something.

785
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,440
Look for a rope or something like that.

786
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,080
There's no ladder.

787
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,160
Bai, come down.

788
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,720
Get the two girls up first.

789
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,560
Girls, come up first. Come on.

790
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,480
I can't hold on.

791
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,480
I really can't hold on.

792
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,960
Bai can pull you up.

793
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,640
Then we'll push you up from below.

794
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,800
If you push yourself up a bit like this, it should work.

795
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,320
It has to be the two of us, since we're tall.

796
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,280
Bai can't do it.

797
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
It's getting deeper.

798
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,480
Hurry.
Go.

799
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
Is that okay, Ba?
It's okay.

800
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,600
Let's go.

801
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,320
Come on.

802
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,560
Slow down.
Okay.

803
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,320
My thermal pants.

804
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,040
Really?

805
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Bai will help you up first.

806
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,200
Two people go up to protect the girls.

807
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Come on.

808
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,080
Hold me with one hand and hold onto this with the other.

809
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,520
Then you can get up.
Come on.

810
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,880
Lift your leg.

811
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,440
Three, two, one, go.

812
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,080
Two, one, go.

813
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,120
Be careful.

814
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,080
Let the girl come.

815
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I think the two of us are about the same.
Come on.

816
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,840
How about I go up first?

817
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,520
Then I'll pull you up from above.

818
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,880
Okay.
Wait, that's not right.

819
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
A guy should pull you up, he'd be stronger.
It's fine.

820
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,320
You guys stay down here.

821
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
I'll support.

822
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,240
Three, two, one.

823
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,920
Slow down, it's okay.

824
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
It's okay.
Hold us.

825
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
The other hand.

826
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:23,880
Come.

827
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,000
Lift your leg.

828
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,520
That's right.

829
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,240
Awesome, brother.

830
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,360
Come on.

831
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,080
Three, two, one, go.

832
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,640
Go.

833
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,800
Give me your hand.

834
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,680
Step on me.

835
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,840
Go ahead, step on me, it's fine.

836
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,080
Come on.
Hand.

837
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,560
Good, bring your leg, your leg.

838
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,280
Find it yourself.

839
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,360
That's right, good.

840
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,400
How do we get up there?

841
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,920
Is there something we can do to help them?

842
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah.

843
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,760
No, this is a security door.

844
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,640
There's nothing here that can help.

845
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,040
It's okay, come on.
You go up first, little brother.

846
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,320
No, I don't have any strength right now.

847
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm really...

848
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,280
That's why I let you go.

849
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,080
You can't carry me.

850
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,000
Wait a second.
Don't rush, no hurry.

851
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,480
No hurry.

852
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,000
The water has increased.

853
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
We need to hurry up.

854
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,560
Let me carry you.
It's okay, come on.

855
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,600
Really?
Sit.

856
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Let me try.
Really.
It's okay.

857
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,440
Hold on tighter up here.

858
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,200
Come on.

859
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,400
Let's go.
Let's go.

860
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,960
Up.

861
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:32,920
Up.

862
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,680
Step on me, step on my shoulder.

863
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,280
Careful.

864
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,640
Careful.

865
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,880
Hold on to me first.

866
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,720
Hold on to me, hold my leg.
Hold my leg.

867
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,760
One, two, three.
Lift your leg, bro.

868
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,560
Lift your leg, bro.
Lift your leg.

869
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,840
Alright.
Okay.

870
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,400
How do I get this last one up?

871
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,880
I think there's a good way for you to

872
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,920
stretch your leg down

873
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,640
Got it
Do you understand?

874
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,320
What do you mean?

875
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,920
Right, can you touch his leg like this?

876
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,480
Yes

877
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,520
My hand is a bit slippery right now

878
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,640
My hand is a bit slippery

879
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,080
Why don't you use this to wipe your hand first?

880
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, don't pull my pants

881
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,960
Right, pull my leg

882
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,000
I can get up

883
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,440
The passage door is about to close.

884
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,600
This is the passage.

885
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,160
The passage we escaped through.

886
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,800
Hurry up.

887
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,840
Quick.

888
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,480
Hurry.

889
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,400
Come.

890
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,120
Come on.

891
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,920
Can't hold it
It's a bit slippery

892
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,720
Here, take it

893
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,520
Here, take it

894
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,080
Okay, one, two, three

895
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,040
Hurry.

896
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,680
No.

897
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,480
Faster.

898
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Pull that door.

899
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,600
Hurry.

900
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Pull that door.

901
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,120
Hurry.

902
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,840
No.

903
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,640
It's okay.

904
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,680
Let me go.

905
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,920
It's okay.

906
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,320
Pull that door. Be careful.

907
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,200
Then what about him?
What should we do?

908
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Congratulations!

909
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,200
Really?

910
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,080
They all succeeded.

911
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,080
That's pretty good.

912
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,160
What should I do?

913
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,560
I really want to cry.

914
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,320
I have already completed my mission.

915
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,200
Sent them

916
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,960
up.

917
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,840
So that's what's ahead of us.

918
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,960
We've wasted quite a bit of time, haven't we?

919
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,880
No.

920
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,720
This is a live murder broadcast.

921
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,240
It was the audience who closed the door.

922
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,960
The sixth limited-edition kill livestream is about to begin.

923
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,880
Kill livestream

924
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,560
The top-ranked viewer can decide how they die.

925
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,880
He wants to see us die one by one.

926
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,400
Yeah.

927
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,840
Let's go to the boss's office again.

928
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,920
Why don't we just go in again and save him?

929
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,960
Okay.

930
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,560
Hurry.

931
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,680
Change your clothes, come on.

932
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,480
Elevator.
Get in the elevator.

933
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,880
How did we end up here?
Where is this?

934
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,520
We still have to move on to the next round.

935
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,200
He really died.

936
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,480
Wow, that was intense.

937
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,080
This is the feeling—it's only exciting when someone dies.

938
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:07,880
I placed a bet.

939
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,000
The person with the special number died, what a huge loss.

940
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,200
How can there be people like this?

941
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,640
Someone died and you still say things like that.

942
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
So there were still people betting.

943
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,480
So people were still placing bets.

944
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,800
I'm the one who manages these things.

945
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,560
Over time,

946
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,800
I became a small-time bookie.

947
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,560
I know who the killer is.

948
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,720
The killer is this person.

949
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,680
Don't forget,

950
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,720
he's the boss of the underground gambling den.

951
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,880
Please explain yourself.

952
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,520
So now you know about my outfit,

953
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,280
and why I wore it, right?

954
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,760
What I've been through these past three years—

955
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,520
don't you know?
We don't know.

956
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,200
How many times have I won from investing?

957
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,360
This time, the top supporter

958
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,600
What kind of surprise will he bring them?

959
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,840
What kind of weapons?

960
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,040
They came at us with machetes.

961
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,920
Now they're using axes.

962
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,480
The top player has made his choice.

963
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,880
The game begins.

964
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,600
Let's go.

965
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,680
I'll cover the rear.

966
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,240
Just don't scare us.

967
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,920
Wait a second.

968
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:28,960
What is that?
What do you mean, what is that?

969
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,000
There's something over there.

970
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,680
They're coming at us with machetes.

971
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,560
It's okay.

972
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,720
This is a livestream.

973
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,560
Are we back here again?

974
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,000
Which way do we go?

975
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,680
I'm not going in front.

976
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,640
No way, I'm scared.

977
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,560
It's fine, there's no one ahead.

978
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,920
I can see there's no one in front.

979
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,720
Let's go together.

980
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,520
Of course, together.

981
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,320
Violent pursuit

982
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,080
Do not pursue

983
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,280
Done

984
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,120
There are words on this

985
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,040
Be careful again.

986
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,280
Whatever you do, don't get caught.

987
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,080
Let me fix that shoelace.

988
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,800
I think we should look together.
A uniform together.

989
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,840
Let's start looking.
Then come on.

990
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,480
Hurry, look.

991
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,880
Here they come.

992
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,240
Here they come.

993
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,400
Playing like this?

994
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,760
Playing like this?

995
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,680
You’re so scary.

996
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
There are so many people here.

997
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,880
Dili, you must be feeling hot.

998
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,600
What?

999
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,560
Sister Dili, are you feeling hot?

1000
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,920
The Heavenly King covers the land and tiger.

1001
00:51:59,320 --> 00:51:59,840
What is that?

1002
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,040
The pagoda subdues the river demon.

1003
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,640
Wrong.

1004
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,480
The Heavenly King covers the land and tiger.

1005
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
You are a fool.

1006
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,840
I am a fool.

1007
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,320
He is a fool.

1008
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,560
Who is a fool?

1009
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,480
Wrong.

1010
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,560
Don't catch me.

1011
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,600
Get in.

1012
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,560
Get in.

1013
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,720
Did you just find something?
We didn't find anything.

1014
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,320
There's a code here.

1015
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,000
There's a code here.

1016
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,400
He just seemed to ask me about this.

1017
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,440
Sister Dili, are you feeling hot?

1018
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,920
What?

1019
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,440
The king covers the land, the tiger.

1020
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,160
Be more careful next time.
If you get caught again,

1021
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,080
just use the code word.

1022
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,640
Hold off the pursuer for one minute.

1023
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,880
We need to memorize this code word.

1024
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,400
Memorize the code word.

1025
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,360
Who could possibly memorize something this long?

1026
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,160
I have an idea.

1027
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,440
We'll leave someone here.

1028
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,640
When others ask you,

1029
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,160
just repeat the question.

1030
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,360
If you see it, give a prompt right away.

1031
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,520
If you want to stay here, just say so.

1032
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,400
No, I think this way has a higher chance of success.

1033
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,360
Then you stay here.
Okay.

1034
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,560
How is it?
Don't stay.

1035
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,400
You're a man, go out and run.

1036
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,640
I can be a woman right now.

1037
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,160
Miss Bai

1038
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,240
Let's recite it together.

1039
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,560
Oh no, oh no, oh my god.

1040
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,040
Why did the magic stop working?

1041
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,960
This is very simple, right?

1042
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,080
Okay.

1043
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,640
Beyond the mountains, more mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings.

1044
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,280
Gently stroke my head.

1045
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,040
Pull up a big radish.

1046
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,280
I'm a male model.

1047
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,560
The king covers the land, the tiger.

1048
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,040
The little cow is one and a half meters tall.

1049
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,800
It's you again, little assassin.

1050
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,720
Don't leave tonight.

1051
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,960
A beam of light, a night of darkness.

1052
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,440
Shed tears for me.

1053
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,680
A bitter fruit is still a fruit.

1054
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,160
Cao Cao doesn't ramble.

1055
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Come over here.

1056
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,640
A family.

1057
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,000
The most important thing for a family

1058
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,680
is

1059
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,360
to be together and united.

1060
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,760
Alright, let me quiz you all, quickly.

1061
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,600
Come

1062
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,600
You all are so amazing.
So amazing.

1063
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,280
Is it really that impressive?

1064
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,200
But you managed to recite this one.

1065
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,440
You recited this one pretty well.

1066
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,600
The three of us are amazing.

1067
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,560
You guys...
See, you didn't read along just now.

1068
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,040
That's the problem, right?

1069
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,000
Kids need to read out loud in class.

1070
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,360
That's how you remember, right?

1071
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,040
Okay.

1072
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,400
Alright, give Lao Bai a correct answer.

1073
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,240
Gray Wolf

1074
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,560
Gray Wolf

1075
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:39,760
Gray Wolf
Yes

1076
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:40,720
Okay
Awesome

1077
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,320
You guys

1078
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,040
You guys

1079
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,960
Come out.

1080
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,280
I’m going to look for (them/it).

1081
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,360
No matter how hard it is, I have to find it.

1082
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,000
No matter how hard it is, I have to find it.

1083
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,040
You go look. You look first.

1084
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,800
I just came out.

1085
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,560
I just arrived.

1086
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,360
Studying is my top priority.

1087
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,800
Let's go.

1088
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,240
No matter how hard it is, I have to find it.

1089
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,360
Handsome guy

1090
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,320
You're not going to arrest me here, are you?

1091
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,880
Be careful.

1092
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,440
No, no, no need to put it on.

1093
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,280
I'll go in.

1094
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,600
What is it?

1095
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,360
I'm out of strength.

1096
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,960
Didn't find a single one.

1097
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,600
The escape token indicator light has been activated.

1098
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,240
Escape token indicator light

1099
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,960
Indicator light

1100
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,520
The ones that sparkle are the ones that have it.

1101
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,080
It's this cabinet.

1102
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,240
Take a look.

1103
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,360
Make sure you get it right.

1104
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,040
This one.
The closest one.

1105
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,160
The first goal next.
Find that one first.

1106
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,640
Then we'll decide.

1107
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,320
Which one of the five of us will stay, okay?

1108
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,320
Let's review it again.

1109
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:40,920
Review it again.

1110
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,720
Come.

1111
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,240
Go. Hurry and check if there is any.

1112
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,160
You stay right here.

1113
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,240
Yes, we can hear you.

1114
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,800
Go ahead.

1115
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:05,960
Come over here.

1116
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,720
A family should always be together.

1117
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,000
Which one else?

1118
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,320
And that one, that one.

1119
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,680
Wisdom fruits grow on the wisdom tree

1120
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,080
That's right

1121
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,640
I am the Sweetness Goddess

1122
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,680
Sweetness Goddess

1123
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,840
I am the Town Beauty Goddess

1124
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,160
Wrong

1125
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,640
It's me, I am the Town Beauty Goddess

1126
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,240
Wrong

1127
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,280
Come on, you two beauties

1128
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,040
You two can leave first

1129
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,720
No, I can't leave

1130
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,880
Family

1131
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,600
Should always stay together

1132
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,480
Love you walking alone through dark alleys

1133
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,440
Turn the corner and meet Grey Wolf

1134
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,880
She said it
Let her go

1135
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,600
She said it

1136
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,120
I just finished

1137
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,960
Move aside

1138
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,240
Dili, you must be hot

1139
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,040
My kneecap got scraped

1140
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,680
Beyond the mountains, more mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings

1141
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,560
I am a male model

1142
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,120
Wrong

1143
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,960
I'm really impressed

1144
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,360
What does "beyond the mountains, more mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings" mean?

1145
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,720
Gently stroke my head

1146
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,560
You brought back a TV

1147
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,400
I don't know if there's anything inside it

1148
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,320
There's nothing

1149
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,240
You brought a TV

1150
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,560
Went shopping

1151
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,000
Saw it

1152
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,680
Found it

1153
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,720
No, no, you don't need to wear it.

1154
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,760
Let's go boating together today.

1155
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,360
Wrong.

1156
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,600
Go in.

1157
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,120
Which other one?

1158
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,320
Now it's two pieces.

1159
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,120
Why is it still flashing, then?

1160
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,920
There.
That place is flashing.

1161
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,440
Yes.
Here it comes.

1162
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,080
Who?
Handsome guy.

1163
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,800
It's me.

1164
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,840
Okay.

1165
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,000
Here.

1166
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,520
Found it.

1167
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,960
Did you find it?

1168
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,440
This is way too high, it's tied at the top.

1169
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,520
Only he can reach it.

1170
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,040
Pull up a big radish

1171
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,840
Wrong

1172
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,000
What
Found it

1173
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,200
Found it

1174
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,680
Come on, your turn

1175
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:05,920
It's your turn

1176
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:06,920
Take it

1177
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:07,960
Come out

1178
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,720
It's my turn, I know

1179
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,000
I know it's my turn

1180
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,720
Just go put it together

1181
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,720
Come out
Okay, come out

1182
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,440
Hurry up

1183
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,960
Come out, hurry up

1184
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,000
But you all can't crowd around here

1185
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,880
Like flies on rotten meat

1186
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,840
What's going on

1187
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,040
Sorry

1188
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:40,960
That's not right.

1189
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,080
They say that studying should be my top priority.

1190
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,760
Nothing that happens outside the window has anything to do with me.

1191
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:55,920
Wrong.

1192
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:58,960
Let's go.

1193
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,160
I put both of them together.

1194
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,040
Okay, then three people can get through.

1195
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,480
It's come to this point.
We should perform

1196
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,400
a scene from a movie now.

1197
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:12,960
What?

1198
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,800
The rule is, for each piece placed,

1199
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,680
one of us can leave.

1200
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,360
But we all chose to stay.

1201
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,640
That's so touching.

1202
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,240
We are a family.

1203
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,520
A family should always stay together.

1204
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,480
Let's decide first

1205
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,200
which one of the five will stay, okay?

1206
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,880
I’ve already given birth.

1207
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,400
My life

1208
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,400
It's about the same for all of us.

1209
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,880
Your life is already complete.

1210
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,560
Go out and take good care of my son.

1211
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,080
The four of us will work to support your child.

1212
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,000
Is that what you mean?
Okay.

1213
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,960
It's up to you. Your nephew is in your hands.

1214
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,520
Alright.

1215
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,680
You have to go, because you're the scout.

1216
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,080
I'll stay.

1217
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,480
I'll stay.
No.

1218
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,400
No way.
No.

1219
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,520
If you get a chance to leave, take it.

1220
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,120
I want to sacrifice for the team.

1221
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,200
No, I'm the oldest.

1222
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,240
I've lived longer than you all.

1223
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,520
You all go first, you're still young.

1224
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
No.

1225
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,680
Because you found it.

1226
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,000
Really, hurry and get out.

1227
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,360
How about this, then?

1228
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,080
Let's make it fair—rock, paper, scissors.

1229
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,280
Whoever wins gets to leave, okay?

1230
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,960
Alright, sure, let's do it.
Okay.

1231
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,800
The loser dies here.

1232
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,440
Alright.

1233
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,840
Rock, paper...

1234
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,080
Rock, paper, scissors!

1235
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,760
You two won.
You two can go.

1236
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,600
Come on.

1237
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,640
Rock, paper,

1238
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,040
scissors.

1239
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:48,800
Let's go.

1240
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,240
You can do it.
I'm leaving.

1241
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,200
Don't worry.

1242
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,560
I'm off.

1243
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,840
Goodbye.
Bye, bro.

1244
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,440
Good luck.

1245
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,960
Make sure you don't get mistaken for X.

1246
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
I'll just take one.

1247
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:07,840
There are also duck feet.

1248
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,680
I'm leaving.

1249
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,400
There are only three of us left.

1250
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,800
Among the three of us,
one of us must be the killer.

1251
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,920
Really? How do you know that?

1252
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,760
That's not necessarily true.

1253
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,880
The killer definitely wants to survive.

1254
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,000
Otherwise, they wouldn't have killed.

1255
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,120
And I'm the detective.

1256
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:43,800
That's right.

1257
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,360
So the killer is either you or me.

1258
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,120
This is inevitable.
And it's also your scheme.

1259
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,240
What should I do?

1260
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,800
I'm a little scared.

1261
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:11,880
Someone's coming.
Who is that?

1262
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,280
The one holding the flashlight

1263
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,480
He’s ranked number one.

1264
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,120
It's him.

1265
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,680
I knew it was you.

1266
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:47,920
What do you want?

1267
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,880
I'm here to save you.

1268
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,520
You're the one sent from the control room, right?

1269
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:56,960
That's right.

1270
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,640
What took you so long?

1271
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,000
I was waiting for you to pick someone up after work.

1272
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,640
Seriously.
Open the door.

1273
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,440
Don't you think today is strange?

1274
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,640
What's strange about it?

1275
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,000
You know our killing livestreams,

1276
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,560
they're usually on the last day of the month.

1277
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,520
But today, out of nowhere,

1278
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,920
we received a payment.

1279
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,720
The phone number ended with 1412.

1280
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,880
They told us to do it ahead of schedule.

1281
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,840
Isn't that really strange?

1282
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,800
Exactly.

1283
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,400
The boss even sent a special message today.

1284
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,440
He said to leave someone alive.

1285
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,280
Let's go.

1286
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,840
The boss has been in touch for so long,

1287
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,920
but we've never even met him.

1288
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,720
Have you ever seen him?
No, never.

1289
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,920
This Boss Tan is really a bit strange.

1290
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,520
He's dead.

1291
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,080
He's already dead.

1292
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,880
No way, don't say that.

1293
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,200
He just sent a message today.

1294
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,040
Told you to leave someone alive.

1295
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,880
Alright, let's go.

1296
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,480
Hurry up.

1297
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:50,720
Come on.

1298
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:56,960
Go ahead and talk.

1299
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,200
Tell us everything you know.

1300
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,280
I don't know much.

1301
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,800
Then just tell us what you do know.

1302
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,120
After I was locked in there,

1303
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,920
he opened the back door.

1304
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,000
Player 37, Ke Ankan

1305
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,840
Escape failed

1306
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,200
About to drown

1307
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,040
The water has stopped

1308
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,360
Drainage system activated

1309
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,720
Water level decreasing

1310
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,200
The water has stopped

1311
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,520
After I climbed up,

1312
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,120
I planned to find you from the entrance.

1313
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,640
But the entrance was still blocked.

1314
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
Then I saw a window with its light on.

1315
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,040
Why is there light coming from here?

1316
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,480
This is...

1317
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,320
After I opened it,

1318
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,920
I entered a place

1319
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,000
called the Cleaner’s Passage.

1320
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,080
It’s for cleaning up bodies.

1321
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,880
Cleaner Passage

1322
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,479
I understand.
Murder Livestream

1323
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,840
This is the murder cleaner

1324
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,279
It's the passage used by those responsible for the killings.

1325
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,840
That's why they're called "cleaners," right?

1326
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,200
What they're cleaning up is us.

1327
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,960
I need to find a place to change clothes.

1328
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,120
Then I'll follow that passage.

1329
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,640
We found it.

1330
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,200
The main control room of his livestream.

1331
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,160
Where is this?

1332
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,479
This should be

1333
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,479
the place where the cleaner is supposed to go.

1334
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,920
This must be the symbol of their organization.

1335
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,840
On the surveillance in the main control room,

1336
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,319
I saw you being chased by Chainsaw Man.

1337
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,279
What?
That's how you play it.

1338
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,479
They were caught.

1339
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,240
I tried to find a way to save you.

1340
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,680
How can I help them?

1341
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,760
I should be able to control it somehow, right?

1342
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,240
Then I was under the table.

1343
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,359
I found the admin's work badge.

1344
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:31,040
And a key.

1345
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,319
Livestream killing admin.

1346
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,640
Violent pursuit.

1347
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,080
Online violence is irrational.

1348
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,760
It kills people without reason.

1349
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,960
That's what they're doing right now.

1350
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,560
Then I had a button for the light.

1351
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,880
It can control the token you’re looking for.

1352
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,600
So I kept flashing that light.

1353
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,960
To get you to look for the token.

1354
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,040
Nice.

1355
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,160
It's right here.

1356
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,760
The escape token guidance light has been activated.

1357
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,240
Hurry!

1358
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,480
Yeah.
I see it.

1359
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,200
Hurry.

1360
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
You’re really clueless.

1361
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,960
I even flashed a light for you and you still couldn’t find it.

1362
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,720
Me.

1363
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,080
I just got here.

1364
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,960
I just got out and was caught and brought back.

1365
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,840
That Bai Dadan is really something.

1366
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,360
I finished assembling it for him.

1367
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,600
I put both of them together.

1368
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,480
Come in.

1369
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,960
This is where I was just now.

1370
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,200
So where are they now?

1371
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,000
Where are they now?
Here.

1372
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,680
They're basically trapped in a confined space now, right?

1373
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,080
Probably.

1374
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,640
The question type is chosen by the top-ranked player.

1375
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,560
If you answer incorrectly, your living space shrinks.

1376
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,320
Until you're crushed by the walls.

1377
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,280
Please use "myself" in a sentence.

1378
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,560
I think about myself.

1379
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,760
I do my best to be myself.

1380
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,720
I don't act like myself.

1381
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,800
I don't love myself.

1382
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,640
What's this?

1383
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,600
Is this some kind of therapy?

1384
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,960
I love myself.

1385
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,080
I envy myself.

1386
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,080
I hate myself.

1387
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,240
I loathe myself.

1388
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,800
I like myself.

1389
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,960
I pity myself.

1390
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,760
I...

1391
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,560
I despise myself.

1392
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,520
I mistreat myself.

1393
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,880
I feel sorry for myself.

1394
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,360
Crushed.

1395
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,400
Crushed.

1396
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,840
Crush me right now.

1397
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,480
(If) Golden Spoon dies,

1398
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,600
Shouldn't you be crying your eyes out?

1399
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,480
I'm brainless.

1400
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,480
I already said that.

1401
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,640
Who said that?

1402
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,360
Player 13, Heniba

1403
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,760
Failed to escape.

1404
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,800
About to be completely crushed by the walls.

1405
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
About to be crushed.

1406
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,040
I don't know

1407
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,120
Player 34

1408
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,200
Golden Spoon

1409
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,480
Failed to escape

1410
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,080
About to be completely crushed by the wall

1411
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,400
Help

1412
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:09,720
Dead

1413
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,520
We can go save them.

1414
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,040
Let's go.

1415
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,400
Then I'll stay here.
You guys go ahead.

1416
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,560
Okay.

1417
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,520
Come on, come out.

1418
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,920
You can come out.

1419
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,480
Of course you can come out.

1420
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,560
I'm here to save you.

1421
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,360
You're here to save us?

1422
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:38,920
What do you mean?

1423
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,160
Who are you?

1424
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,520
I'm the boss.

1425
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,760
Slaughter Live Stream Management.
I'm the boss.

1426
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,920
We've successfully infiltrated them now.

1427
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,000
Come on, follow us.

1428
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,320
Are we breaking the rules right now, or...

1429
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,080
No, the boss rescued us.

1430
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,000
I see.

1431
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,240
The boss came to save you.

1432
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,320
Stick with the boss.

1433
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:56,880
Okay?
What about Ba?

1434
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,800
No, she really wasn't saved.

1435
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,960
I was a step too late when I arrived.

1436
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,760
Ba was killed first.

1437
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,800
The other two are being executed.

1438
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,520
Yeah.

1439
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,520
They killed one first, and then...

1440
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,360
What? That is...

1441
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:19,840
It's started.

1442
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,000
It's a lot of fun.

1443
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,520
You're back.

1444
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,320
How are you still alive?

1445
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,120
Didn't he say he was too late to save you?

1446
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,880
I was just messing with you.

1447
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,320
So we can watch him now.
Now, right?

1448
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,120
He's over there.

1449
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,160
He's currently at
which level?

1450
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,240
That level has doors everywhere.

1451
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:56,920
It seems full of opportunities.

1452
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,560
But once caught in public opinion,

1453
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,680
no one can escape.

1454
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,640
Amidst toxic gas, powder, and liquid,

1455
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,040
with hope of getting out,

1456
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,920
they search for a nonexistent exit.

1457
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,000
In the end, they're tortured to death.

1458
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,800
They return the way they came.

1459
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,520
Are you kidding me?

1460
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,160
There are no more doors.

1461
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,400
Find the real exit.

1462
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,720
Find the real exit.

1463
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,400
Is anyone there?

1464
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,280
Can you kick it open?

1465
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,480
Help me.

1466
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,040
Is anyone there?

1467
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,680
Help!

1468
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,640
Help!

1469
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,320
What?

1470
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,600
Help!

1471
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,840
Alright, let's go save Ning.

1472
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,280
You guys are alive.

1473
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,760
My good brothers.
Let's go.

1474
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:51,640
Hurry, let's go.

1475
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,320
You don't really know what's going on right now, do you?

1476
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,440
You're the admin. What about you?

1477
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,000
Lackey.

1478
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,520
So you two are in this together.

1479
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,080
No, I'm not.

1480
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,440
No.

1481
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,920
I recruited him later.

1482
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,000
What do you mean?

1483
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,040
But only the three of us survived.

1484
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,320
Really?
Yeah.

1485
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,680
Only the three of us made it.

1486
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,240
That's right.

1487
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,200
We didn't have time to save the others.

1488
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,760
Because I could only choose who to save.

1489
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,480
I chose to save you two.

1490
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,640
Why?

1491
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,840
Because I think our heights

1492
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,720
match better together.

1493
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,240
He picked a dream team.

1494
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,080
We did it on purpose.

1495
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,400
No, really.

1496
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,920
So unfortunately,

1497
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,160
we couldn't save those three.

1498
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,520
For the next mission,

1499
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,680
the three of us will do it.

1500
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,080
I don't want to play anymore.

1501
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,240
I don't want to play anymore.

1502
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,800
I think that's what was said.

1503
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,400
You're not dead.

1504
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:50,960
That's right.

1505
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,720
They brought us here.

1506
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,880
Logically speaking,

1507
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,440
there really should be deaths in every round.

1508
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,040
This is a live streaming factory.

1509
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,200
There was no news after entering the limited live stream.

1510
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,800
Boss's key not received.

1511
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,680
This transport cannot proceed along the original route.

1512
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,480
Now heading to the boss's office.

1513
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,360
What does that mean?

1514
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,960
Boss's key received.

1515
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,800
Now heading to the limited live stream room.

1516
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,600
Limited live stream room.

1517
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,160
The sixth limited slaughter live stream is about to begin.

1518
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,080
Slaughter live stream.

1519
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,480
About our slaughter live stream,

1520
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,960
it's usually on the last day of each month.

1521
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,280
But why did they have us do it early today?

1522
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,560
Ke An, look.

1523
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,840
Ba Fen Tang.

1524
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,120
Bai Han Zi.

1525
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,840
About to be executed.

1526
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,520
But I wasn't drowned.

1527
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,720
Even at the chainsaw part, someone should have died.

1528
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,320
But when I went there, they were still alive.

1529
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,800
Then the person with the chainsaw said

1530
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,120
he called the boss.

1531
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,000
The boss specifically instructed us

1532
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,840
that today's slaughter live stream

1533
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,880
no one is allowed to be killed.

1534
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,120
Right.

1535
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,000
We must leave survivors.

1536
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,880
And they even moved up the slaughter live stream.

1537
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,160
Because except for Tan Qian,

1538
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,400
no one else should know this place exists.

1539
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,240
Logically speaking,

1540
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,640
that means

1541
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,200
someone is still giving them orders.

1542
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,200
Let's search around first, okay?

1543
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,760
Box

1544
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,480
Isn't this that person's box?

1545
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,520
That An Wenzhe

1546
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,680
This is the person

1547
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,080
No, that's not right.

1548
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,880
There's a lock here.

1549
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,200
What's the password?

1550
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,160
The last four digits of the phone number are still 1412.

1551
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,120
1412.

1552
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,000
It's open.
The box is open.

1553
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,960
Why is there still a lock?

1554
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:43,880
This piece of paper

1555
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,920
A corner of it was sticking out of the suitcase.

1556
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,240
I just tore it, and this half came off.

1557
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,680
List of accomplices

1558
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,080
Falsely presenting job introductions

1559
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,000
Involving innocent people

1560
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,400
Bai Huanzi

1561
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,840
You were the one who lured them.

1562
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,840
Bai Huanzi.

1563
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,160
Acted as a middleman in between.

1564
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:11,960
Come on, say it yourself.

1565
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,240
Explain yourself.

1566
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,400
I used to do odd jobs outside.

1567
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,920
I had a group of buddies.

1568
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,520
Then I came to the factory and made some money.

1569
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,600
So I introduced them to come as well.

1570
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,040
2024 "Morning Glory" of the Year

1571
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,280
"Morning Glory"

1572
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,720
Why is Bai Hanzi called "Morning Glory"?

1573
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,320
How was I supposed to know this was a livestream?

1574
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,480
He's just a scammer.

1575
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,480
Calling others scammers.

1576
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,040
What about you?
And you yourself?

1577
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,680
What does Heniba do?

1578
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,880
He gambles.

1579
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,600
I'm the one who sets up the game.

1580
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,360
What kind of game? I don't get it.

1581
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,920
I'm the mastermind behind the scenes.

1582
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,000
He's the one running the game.

1583
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,120
You're the mastermind behind the scenes?

1584
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,480
Yes.

1585
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,880
This is the killer.

1586
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,720
Don't forget, he's the boss of the underground casino.

1587
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:14,760
No.

1588
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,280
The person who made these investment rules

1589
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,080
So you’re saying you didn’t know this was a killing game?

1590
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,720
I didn’t know.

1591
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,680
What about you?

1592
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,120
What is Ke An Kan?

1593
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,320
From evil.

1594
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,000
To get free in-game rewards,

1595
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,280
you just shared my “big treasure.”

1596
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,560
There was a group below asking if there were any new skins recently.

1597
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,480
Ke An Kan said, “I just finished uploading.”

1598
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,480
Let me show you my big treasure.

1599
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,560
But how could this hurt anyone?

1600
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,720
Falling to death, buried alive.

1601
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,760
Burned to death, drowned.

1602
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,040
Who did you harm?

1603
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,800
I don’t know who I harmed.

1604
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,880
As for Peeping, he was the only one.

1605
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,160
Peeping was hiding in the factory.

1606
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,640
He personally installed all the surveillance cameras.

1607
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,920
So far, it’s been found to have indirectly caused

1608
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,600
hanging, shooting,

1609
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,320
choking, electrocution.

1610
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,840
You’re the only one on the list of accomplices.

1611
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,160
It's like the small camera that was removed that day.

1612
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,160
You installed all of them.

1613
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,560
The electrician is here, everyone.

1614
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,440
Take it down.

1615
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,800
You go ahead and speak first.

1616
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,120
Explain what happened.

1617
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,320
I'm sorry.

1618
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,640
I'm sorry.

1619
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,760
What do you mean by "I'm sorry"?

1620
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,200
Because I really can't find a job.

1621
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,200
This is the only way I can make money.

1622
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,920
He could offer me a job.

1623
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,800
So the job he offered me

1624
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,520
was to install some cameras.

1625
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,400
Then he said he wanted to monitor his employees.

1626
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,960
To make sure they work properly and things like that.

1627
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,320
I didn't really know the details.

1628
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,760
So you didn't know about the live streaming?

1629
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,760
Right, I thought it was just surveillance.

1630
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,840
I didn't know that the surveillance footage

1631
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,560
would be broadcasted.

1632
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,840
I was just there to install the cameras.

1633
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,760
Then I have a question.

1634
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,000
Go ahead.

1635
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,840
Since you knew about all

1636
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,320
the locations of the cameras,

1637
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,960
when we were looking for the cameras,

1638
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:09,920
why did you pretend there?
Yeah.

1639
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,920
Why was that?

1640
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,160
Because I was afraid

1641
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,600
I wouldn't be able to be friends with you anymore.

1642
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,720
When you guys died just now,
I cried so hard I couldn't stop.

1643
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,360
I was afraid I'd lose this friendship.

1644
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:32,400
I trust him.

1645
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,280
Because when he died just now,

1646
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,120
he cried so much he couldn't even walk.

1647
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,520
It was actually really genuine and heartfelt.

1648
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,120
Yeah, he even cried so much he wet his pants.

1649
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,320
His pants were soaked from crying.

1650
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,560
What the heck?

1651
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,040
Question.

1652
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,440
So An Wenzhe, also known as Tui Youfu,

1653
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,720
thought we knew about it

1654
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,440
and were deeply involved.

1655
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,240
So he thought we were connected to it.

1656
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:56,640
Right.

1657
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,720
We're doomed.

1658
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,680
So he wanted to kill us.

1659
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,480
So the person who killed him today

1660
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,680
knew he was coming after us

1661
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,640
and wanted to get rid of him first.
Right.

1662
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,680
Yeah.

1663
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,080
Then is it possible to tell those

1664
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,000
guys with chainsaws

1665
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,600
not to go kill him,

1666
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,920
just like An Wenzhe said?

1667
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,640
He wasn't familiar with us at first.

1668
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,320
But when he saw
our information,

1669
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:20,640
he concluded

1670
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,120
that we were accomplices in this killing livestream.

1671
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,520
That's right.

1672
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,440
So he decided to kill us.

1673
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,120
Yes.

1674
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,320
Actually, deep down,

1675
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,520
he hates this livestream.

1676
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,560
He didn't want us to get involved in the killing livestream.

1677
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,120
Yes.
After Tan Qian died,

1678
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,480
he gave them an order here first,

1679
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,640
saying that the livestream couldn't kill anyone anymore.

1680
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,040
Right.

1681
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,200
But he didn't expect

1682
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,960
that when he tied us up there,

1683
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,560
he didn't manage to kill us.

1684
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,680
In the end, one of us

1685
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,360
killed him instead.

1686
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,560
We stumbled into the killing livestream by accident.

1687
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,000
Yes.

1688
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,320
That's the logic.

1689
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,200
The Little Frog Song

1690
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,440
My phone—my phone is ringing.

1691
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,120
Why is it the Little Frog Song?

1692
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,480
Who are you, really? Tell me.

1693
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,000
Who are you?

1694
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,200
I am...

1695
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,520
You are...

1696
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,840
What?

1697
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,400
Congratulations, you are our lucky customer.

1698
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,640
Who are you?

1699
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,320
Eighty-one were designed based on human evil.

1700
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,320
It's a killing machine.

1701
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,280
An Wenzhe actually came here to

1702
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:41,720
find me.

1703
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,920
He wants to catch the real culprit behind the scenes.

1704
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,040
Hiding in the factory.

1705
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,520
Personally installed all the surveillance cameras.

1706
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,800
We'll set up a livestream room for you.

1707
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,520
Rebirth livestream.
Hype.

1708
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:51,920
Playing the victim.

1709
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,400
He's just a puppet boss.

1710
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,800
So you want to turn around and kill people.

1711
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,360
It's me. It must be me.

1712
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,160
What?

1713
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,440
Victim list.

1714
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,680
You designed this.

1715
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,960
What are you acting out over there?

1716
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,240
You want to return all this evil to me.

1717
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,760
That's right, I admit I want to kill you.

1718
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,040
You're too cruel.

1719
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,240
Did you know

1720
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,480
he wants to find you?

1721
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,800
What does that have to do with me?

1722
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,160
We just want to hear it.

1723
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,040
The killer must have gone back a second time.

1724
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,440
Why didn't you have a reason to go back a second time?

1725
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:24,960
Because

1726
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,240
you definitely would have gone back again.

1727
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,960
I was right there, he wanted to kill me.

1728
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,120
Then would he come to the dorm

1729
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:29,920
and just take you out directly?

1730
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,640
That's not a reason.

1731
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,520
If that's how you are,

1732
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,600
then I just want to kill him.

1733
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,960
I'll just do it.

1734
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,720
Actually, none of the three of us are innocent now.

1735
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,640
The cleanest one is him.

1736
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,600
Who do you think the killer is?

1737
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,840
It's between the two of you.
