1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,840
Someone died again.

2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,320
Who is this?

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't know them.

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,520
I don't know him.

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,760
I don't know him.

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,640
I don't know either.

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,480
I don't know.

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,120
We need to finish this training soon.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,400
Then find those five top extras.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
Ask who the one with red hair is.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,920
We don't have any extras with red hair.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm not sure about that.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,720
He was wearing a hospital gown.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,760
He stole a piece of clothing.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,760
I treated you as a friend, but you betrayed me.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,400
I want revenge.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,800
Someone who used to be a good friend of one of us.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,120
Yeah.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,040
What do you mean?

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
Why are you dressed as a woman?

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
Then He said, "Don't worry about it."

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,360
You're a cross-dressing boss.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,080
You're a cross-dressing boss.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,000
Where did you go?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,600
I took the wrong phone.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
You're holding my phone now.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Tiebu Mountain Barbecue

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,600
When are you coming back?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,560
Everything's grilled and ready.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,320
If you don't come back soon, it'll get cold.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
A group of people suddenly showed up.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
They looked fierce and intimidating.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,960
You

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,600
Suddenly, a group of people who looked

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
fierce and intimidating appeared.

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,160
Wait a second, let me check the settings.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,080
What's the name of this device?

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
You should remember it too.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,240
I learned my lesson yesterday.

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,720
Let me tell you,

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
from now on,

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,760
if we want to check if our partner is cheating,

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,360
just check their personal information.

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
It works every time.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
I've checked everything, there's nothing else.

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,760
Then there's still this poster.

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,440
Talent Star turns into Comedy Star.

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,800
Why is the popular contestant acting like this?

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,880
May 2022

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,560
The annual

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080
Talent Star selection began,

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,800
one student, with his handsome looks,

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,720
and outstanding performance skills,

54
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,240
became the undisputed number one.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,760
He secured the Talent Star crown in advance.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,280
However, recently, several

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,880
anonymous students reported

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,800
that they had seen, in various corners of the campus,

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
the popular contestant, while walking,

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,640
suddenly doing imaginary basketball shots.

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Suddenly hugging a tree

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,200
Singing loudly, "How do penguins call?"

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,760
and other strange behaviors

64
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
were even recorded on video and widely circulated

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,720
All the students and teachers at school, and even people online

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,240
were deeply attracted by the popular contestant's humor

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
and charm

68
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,640
Currently, this contestant's popularity has declined

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,800
No one knows who will win the Star of Talent this year

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,880
or where the honor will go

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Are they talking about you?

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,800
It's not me

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Look again carefully

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
How is it not you?

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,480
It's a long story

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,720
That classmate, Tui, was

77
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,120
one of the most popular students in our 2022 class

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,920
He was really popular

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,040
Yeah

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,160
And I'm a very ambitious person

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
I really, really wanted

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
to win the Star of Talent award

83
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
But Tui was just too popular

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
So I came up with an idea

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,120
Because I found out

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
that Tui is a hopeless romantic

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,160
So I

88
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I just

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,880
decided to seduce him

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,160
He thought of you as a brother

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
He dressed up as a girl to seduce him

92
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Are you serious?

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,240
So I bought some

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
clothes to dress myself up

95
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
Dude

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
and took some photos

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,200
and created a new account called Xiao Chichi

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
I started chatting with Tui.

99
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
Why are you chatting with him?

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,320
I want to be good friends with him, yes.

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
I want to be very good friends with him.

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,720
No.

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,680
He just dressed up as a girl to attract that person.

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,519
He just wants to be with that person.

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,480
And then Tui,

106
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,280
after getting closer to me,

107
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,760
then I said,

108
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,840
I prefer to look at

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,080
slam dunks in the air

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
or hugging big trees and things like that.

111
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
Tui would take some

112
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
photos like that for me

113
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,480
and send them to me.

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Then I also took some

115
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,720
I also took some

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,160
nice photos of myself and sent them to him.

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,920
We became online friends like that.

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
And in the end,

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Tui, because of these actions, was

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,520
photographed by the public in candid shots,

121
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
and people’s opinion of him dropped.

122
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,080
I see.

123
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,320
So his votes kept getting lower.

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
My popularity kept rising.

125
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,840
So I became

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,880
the Tui Art Star of 2022.

127
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,160
By any means necessary

128
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
It's a big game being played

129
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,440
Okay

130
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
What's the story with that phone?

131
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
The phone belongs to He’s friend

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
My good friend is my roommate

133
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
So your good friend found out about this

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,120
Yes

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Did he question you about it?

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,960
He found out about me

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
The photos of me wearing those pretty clothes

138
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,600
He asked me about it

139
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,720
He asked me about it

140
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
I told him not to worry about it

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,840
It’s just something between me and my online friends

142
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,680
Just some little quirks

143
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,080
In 2022

144
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
On the night of the Star of Arts selection

145
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
We went to eat barbecue

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Then at the barbecue place

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
We happened to take the wrong phones

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
What did your good friend say afterwards?

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
What was with the fierce-looking people?

150
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,880
Suddenly a group of people showed up

151
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,480
They looked really fierce

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
After we took the wrong phones

153
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
Because I had left at that time

154
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
Then he was at the barbecue stall

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
He was beaten up by a classmate named Tui

156
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Tui also found out

157
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,040
That I wore women’s clothes

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Tui came to beat me up.

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,640
But he took the wrong phone by mistake.

160
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
His phone's location was tracked

161
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
to my friend He’s phone.

162
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
I see, you switched phones.

163
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,120
So this person thought

164
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
you were the one always cross-dressing.

165
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
He beat up your friend.

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,200
Right, he thought my friend was me.

167
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
So he beat him up.

168
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
So the chat history suddenly stopped at

169
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,640
when a group of people appeared.

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
So it’s pretty much the same as his story.

171
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,200
It felt like that.

172
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,280
After he got beaten up,

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
I only found out the next day.

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
My friend He

175
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
was beaten by Tui and fell off a cliff.

176
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,520
He was beaten to death, right?

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes, I only found out the next day.

178
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
It also happened at Tiebu Mountain.

179
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,920
At the barbecue stand.

180
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,360
I understand.

181
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,240
The barbecue stand at Tiebu Mountain.

182
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,200
So He came to get revenge on you today.

183
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,320
Yes.

184
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,000
You saw your friend show up here.

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,960
And then you

186
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,560
tricked him into going upstairs.

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
picked up the sledgehammer.

188
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Eighty.

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
Eighty.

190
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,720
He is a very good friend of mine.

191
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Why would I want to kill him?

192
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
He wants to come back and kill you.

193
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,120
He wants revenge.

194
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,560
That was just an accident.

195
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,840
But he doesn't think so.

196
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,840
He thinks the same way.

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,680
He said I was your best friend.

198
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,920
Why did you want to hurt me?

199
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
You let your friend take the beating for you.

200
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Alright, let's take another look at the prince.

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
What does this mean?

202
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,640
Why is he the only one who has this?

203
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,760
He's this, right?

204
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,640
My name is Prince Charming.

205
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,640
Prince Charming.

206
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm honestly speechless.

207
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
First, tell us what's going on.

208
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
Okay, I'll talk about this painting.

209
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
I grew up in an orphanage.

210
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,720
The director of our orphanage

211
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
just hoped that we

212
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
all the children

213
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,320
could have lives as wonderful as in fairy tales.

214
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,680
Right, so the names we were given

215
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
were things like Prince Charming,

216
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,240
Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty.

217
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,280
All these people are my good friends.

218
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
Even though we were happy growing up,

219
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,160
I always felt

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,800
that being left at the orphanage at such a young age

221
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
made me determined to become famous one day.

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,720
To become someone

223
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,480
who would make my parents

224
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,160
make my parents

225
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,920
regret what they did back then.

226
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeah.

227
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,760
I've had this dream since I was little.

228
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
I drew this picture when I was a child.

229
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,080
And I've kept it with me ever since.

230
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,200
Because we always liked to play house.

231
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,400
I see.

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
So you made others play the seven dwarfs,

233
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
while you took both princess roles for yourself.

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Yeah.

235
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,560
Yes, that's right.

236
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
What are you doing?

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
Should I search for it?

238
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
I really couldn't find this.

239
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
Found Prince Charming's WeChat, quick!

240
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,920
Assistant director of "Dance Law Dance Sky"

241
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,360
June 10th, 2021

242
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,040
This assistant director sent him a picture.

243
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,600
An Actor's Self-Cultivation

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,280
About to start a new life—a Weibo post.

245
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,240
Then asked,

246
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Prince Charming asked, "Did you post this?"

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
The script is such a confidential thing,

248
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
how can you just post it online?

249
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,600
It hasn't even become popular yet and it's already in trouble.

250
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
A five-million confidentiality agreement

251
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,160
was just for fun, right?

252
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
Just wait for the lawyer's letter and to get blacklisted.

253
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,760
Then Prince Charming said,

254
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,120
Director, you've misunderstood.

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
This is Bai Pengyou's alternate account.

256
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,840
He and I are in the same scene.

257
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
The phone number is his too, take a look.

258
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Checked it.

259
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
It really is his account.

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,880
You newcomers really need to be more careful.

261
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,120
It's one thing if you can't make a living yourself,

262
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
but don't make me lose my job too.

263
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Old Bai said,

264
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,720
Of course, don't worry.

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
I would never do something so stupid, Director.

266
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
Your friend posted the script online.

267
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,880
No, that's not it.

268
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,320
Look, you said "my director,"

269
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,840
this is Bai Pengyou's alternate account.

270
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
What I want to say is,

271
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
it must have been you who stole the script.

272
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
But you were scared, you were timid.

273
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
You were afraid of being blacklisted.

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,520
So you told the director

275
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,160
that it was Bai Pengyou who stole the script, not you.

276
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Then why is the account linked to the phone

277
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,360
also using his phone number?

278
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,160
You must have done something behind the scenes.

279
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,920
Is it possible

280
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,360
that the two of us were in the same scene,

281
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,920
and then he leaked the script,

282
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,720
and the assistant director thought it was me?

283
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,280
I told him I didn't do it.

284
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Because if you check later,

285
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,720
the account is linked to whose phone number,

286
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,680
it really is his.

287
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
Could it be like this?

288
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,080
And just like that,

289
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,280
he ended up hurting his own friend.

290
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
Then let's keep looking.

291
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
Why is there a letter like this in here?

292
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,520
This letter—

293
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,760
Honestly, I haven't even read it myself.

294
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
Because I didn't dare to open it.

295
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,400
There are two matches on the letter.

296
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,760
You can burn it.

297
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,760
Look, like this.

298
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,480
And inside, it says—

299
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,200
How romantic.

300
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
And when you burn it like this—

301
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,800
Don't set it on fire.

302
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Look, do you see it?

303
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
What is it?

304
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
After you burn it—

305
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,240
You can see what's inside.

306
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Prince Charming.

307
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
Prince Charming, after thinking it over and over,

308
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,960
I still can't believe it was you who hurt me.

309
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Many times I wanted to ask you for the truth.

310
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,840
But I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

311
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,240
I've already lost everything.

312
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,320
There's nothing left for me to hold on to.

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
But if it really was you,

314
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
I won't let you go, even if I become a ghost.

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,440
This letter, I—

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
I've never read it before.

317
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,840
So he said

318
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,520
he has never read this letter.

319
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,040
That's because how could he dare to read it?

320
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,640
What could give him the courage to read this letter?

321
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:41,960
Nothing.

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Alright.

323
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Let me tell you a story about me and my friend.

324
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,000
Seriously, you guys...

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,240
Seriously, you guys...

326
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
What did we do wrong?

327
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,240
Do you think we're incompetent?

328
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,040
Do you think we're incompetent?

329
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
That tone of yours...

330
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
No.

331
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,120
Very good.

332
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Very good.

333
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,640
Where did we fall short?

334
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
You can't even open this.

335
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,000
We opened it for you.

336
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,600
Here's what happened.

337
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
Since we were all classmates,

338
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,040
during the summer after our first year,

339
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
I started going to auditions and working.

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
That's how I met Bai.

341
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,680
We really shared the same interests.

342
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
We got along very well.

343
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Later, we often went together

344
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
to auditions and such, yes.

345
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,440
Then one day,

346
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,960
I got an invitation to audition.

347
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
It was rare to get four lines.

348
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,240
So I really cherished the opportunity.

349
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,200
Okay.

350
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,360
Bai also contacted me and said

351
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,480
he happened to get the same invitation.

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,920
When we checked,

353
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
it was the same scene, and we had lines together.

354
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
We were so happy.

355
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,240
I wanted to post something to show

356
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,680
how excited I was, maybe show off a little.

357
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
But I didn't mean to show off.

358
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
I accidentally posted a picture of the script.

359
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
I only meant to post

360
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,560
a picture about my status.

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
But I didn't realize I had posted it.

362
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,080
I just went to sleep.

363
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,560
The next morning, when I checked,

364
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,280
I saw I had posted the script.

365
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,240
I posted the script.

366
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,040
Then I suddenly realized

367
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,640
Bai and I were in the same scene.

368
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,960
He also had this script.

369
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
You're falsely accusing him.

370
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,600
Look at this.

371
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
Being friends with someone like that...

372
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
Seriously.

373
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,200
Then I came up with a really

374
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,360
vicious idea.

375
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,000
Because this account

376
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,840
can have its linked phone number changed.

377
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,920
So I rushed to my friend Bai's house.

378
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,480
I used his phone number

379
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
and linked it to the account.

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Then I thought nothing could go wrong.

381
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Sure enough, the assistant director came to me.

382
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,280
Asked if it was me.

383
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,960
About the chat log you just found.

384
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,160
Then I thought I was in the clear.

385
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,920
Because I really valued this opportunity.

386
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,400
This was the only way.

387
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Not long after,

388
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,160
I heard that Bai jumped off a cliff.

389
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
He committed suicide by jumping.

390
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

391
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,880
He was forced to.

392
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Then when I went home,

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,200
that letter appeared at my door.

394
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,520
Because no one knew where I lived.

395
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,320
Only he knew.

396
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,640
So I think the letter might have been

397
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,680
left there by him.

398
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,280
I’ve always felt guilty and didn’t dare to read it.

399
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
But I kept it in my bag all this time.

400
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,080
To remind myself.

401
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,440
I never expected to see him here.

402
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,800
You’re anxious, scared, ashamed, and embarrassed.

403
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,280
The only thing you can do is kill him.

404
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,720
Kill him.

405
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,040
That’s right.

406
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,280
Everyone's logic is the same.

407
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
It's all to protect their own lives.

408
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,240
Yes, it's all the same.

409
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,400
I think it must be.

410
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,600
This friend told him something like,

411
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
"Stop talking, I won't believe anything you say."

412
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,920
"I'm going to kill you."

413
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,720
"And before I kill you,"

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,560
"I want to tell the whole world"

415
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,320
"how you caused my death."

416
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
"I'll let everyone know who you really are."

417
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,360
Right.

418
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
"So your name will be disgraced forever."

419
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,160
Let's search for this.

420
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Here, the cloakroom.

421
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,840
Cloakroom.

422
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,400
Yes.

423
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,400
The wardrobe area must be

424
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,680
quite famous.

425
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,160
This is the outfit you wore back then, right?

426
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Or do you prefer this one?

427
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
I prefer this one.

428
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,000
Who ate this?

429
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,480
What did they eat?

430
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,360
Tiebushan Strange Tales

431
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,920
Tiebushan Strange Tales Training Camp

432
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
That means

433
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,080
the extras from the training camp have eaten here.

434
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,680
They left it here.

435
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,480
Someone has been in here.

436
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
That is, the deceased.

437
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,840
He was hungry.

438
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,640
He was eating

439
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
while coming over here to find

440
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
the workstation of the person I want to take revenge on.

441
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
I want to see what's going on.

442
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
He sure had a lot of free time.

443
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
He even had time to eat.

444
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,520
He was already sick.

445
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,200
He looked really down and out.

446
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,280
It's only right for him to eat something.

447
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,520
No, he really looked like

448
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
he was imprisoned or something.

449
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,760
Yes, that's right.

450
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,520
Okay, no problem.

451
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,840
Let's keep looking.

452
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Better to have nothing than something subpar.

453
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,200
Trained in the Ke school.

454
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,240
A face as delicate as jade.

455
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,800
What's in this golden-branded bag?

456
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
There's nothing inside.

457
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,160
Nothing inside.

458
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,800
So, does that mean inside here

459
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
there's something, right?

460
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes, in our costumes

461
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,440
there must be something.

462
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,480
What?

463
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,600
Whose is this?

464
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Okay, let's look first.

465
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,520
Let's talk one by one.

466
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,680
What's with the Prince Charming?

467
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
If I go after you, I never miss.

468
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,400
What is this?

469
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
Every three steps, you dart forward.

470
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Then you look back twice.

471
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,440
After five steps, you bend down.

472
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,680
After six steps, you shake your head.

473
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Then you go right, left, right, left.

474
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,760
After five steps, you shake your head.

475
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,160
After six steps, you look back.

476
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
What is this thing?

477
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,280
There's a long story behind this recording.

478
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
Last night at ten o'clock,

479
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
didn't we finish

480
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,280
the investigation of the billion-dollar case?

481
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,960
The investigation, right?

482
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,880
Then we went back to rest.

483
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,960
Then at midnight, they said we had to come to the training camp.

484
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,640
I thought it over and over, but I had no choice.

485
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,000
I had to find a way

486
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,760
to get close to the assistant director.

487
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
I wanted him to

488
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,280
see my talent and hard work.

489
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
So you picked up

490
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
the dress that belongs to Ba Mian Linglong.

491
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
You secretly put it on.

492
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
You found it here.

493
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
I just took a costume.

494
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
I found the assistant director.

495
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,040
He was in the director's studio.

496
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,319
After I went there, I told him,

497
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Can you give me some guidance on the kissing scene?

498
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,119
Can you give me some guidance on the kissing scene?

499
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,760
You practiced with him?

500
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
What?

501
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
You definitely wore this costume

502
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
with the director.

503
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,160
You, as a guy, seriously...

504
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,480
What are you trying to do?

505
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
He went to see the director.

506
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,920
He dressed up as a woman.

507
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
That's right, we can't discriminate against that.

508
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
No, he didn't dress up as a woman.

509
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
Didn't you steal my clothes?

510
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
I wore these clothes.

511
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,840
I just made that up.

512
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,240
I thought he really wore that.

513
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,920
I asked the assistant director to guide me in the kissing scene.

514
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,160
Then the assistant director really approved of me.

515
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,520
He said, "You're a very dedicated actor."

516
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,880
How did he prove you were dedicated?

517
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,160
How did he guide you?

518
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
Anyway, he just...

519
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,040
When he was guiding me,

520
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
I recorded the audio.

521
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
He said, for kissing,

522
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
go left, right, up, and down.

523
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,200
That's the kind of kiss you need.

524
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
Kiss, turning back after every step.

525
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
Then I recorded this.

526
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
After it ended, I went back to the rest area.

527
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,640
Altogether, it was

528
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,680
about fifteen minutes.

529
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,280
Around fifteen minutes.

530
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
But the exact time frame

531
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,400
I can't remember clearly.

532
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,320
I didn't keep track of the time.

533
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,840
Alright.

534
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,200
You've been to the tent area, right?

535
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,600
Yes.

536
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Okay.

537
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,680
I found this.

538
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
From the Ke school.

539
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,480
There was something in the pocket.

540
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,000
It's called "Iron Cloth Mountain Tales" Training Camp.

541
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Main character casting criteria.

542
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
Able to change facial expressions.

543
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Can

544
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,680
switch between glaring angrily, being stunned,

545
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,280
smiling with joy, or looking sorrowful,

546
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,120
and freely shift among emotions like howling at the sky.

547
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,800
Next is physical flexibility.

548
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
Able to do a split and a handstand.

549
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,760
Spin in place twenty times in a row.

550
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,320
Do moves like a ninety-degree flying kick.

551
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,120
Good physical fitness.

552
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,560
Quickly do one-arm push-ups.

553
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,960
Do push-ups while carrying a female actor.

554
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
Spread your arms wide, get up from the ground.

555
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,720
Do moves like a kip-up.

556
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Then you have to try it.

557
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,040
Who should try?

558
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,560
You have to try, come on.

559
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,120
Him.

560
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes, try it.

561
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,760
Come on, start with this requirement, let's go.

562
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,040
Ke.

563
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,000
First, give me a fierce glare.

564
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,520
A fierce glare.

565
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,240
Okay, three, two, one.

566
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
You see your girlfriend cheating.

567
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
You see your girlfriend cheating.

568
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
But this is the 108th time.

569
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,000
You're already numb to it.

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,040
You have to follow the emotion, you know?

571
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,880
Got it.

572
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,520
Cheating.

573
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
What did he do to deserve this?

574
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
The girl cheated 108 times.

575
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,840
Isn't it just...

576
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,160
Isn't that just how she is?

577
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,320
He's already numb to it.

578
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,280
See?

579
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,040
Let me show you, follow my lead.

580
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
Big smile, then deep sorrow.

581
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,840
Then look up and howl.

582
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,280
Like this, okay?

583
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Come on.

584
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,080
Alright, he's your "girlfriend."

585
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Pretend that.

586
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,800
You open the door and come home.

587
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,120
You're very happy.

588
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
It's your wedding anniversary.

589
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,240
You see your wife hugging someone else.

590
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
But it's happened so many times already.

591
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,640
You're just numb to it.

592
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
Turns out she's hugging a dummy.

593
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,280
You smile brightly.

594
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,800
But this dummy...

595
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,320
...was made to look like Bai's face.

596
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
You feel deeply saddened.

597
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,720
Turns out you still can't compare to Bai Yu.

598
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,680
You look up and howl, then walk out the door.

599
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,120
But if it's Bai,

600
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,400
I wouldn't howl at the sky.

601
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,200
My brother is just so handsome.

602
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay.

603
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,120
Wait a moment.

604
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,160
The schedule for later is:

605
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,200
The extras will rehearse the scene on their own once.

606
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
Lighting coordination.

607
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,280
The lights should be on for three seconds, off for three seconds.

608
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Alternate flashing in this pattern.

609
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,040
The extras and the director will rehearse the group scene.

610
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,840
All departments need to coordinate.

611
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,000
This should be useful.

612
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,360
There's a timeline here.

613
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,520
It's for 11:10 PM.

614
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,400
What's going on?

615
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,760
Where did this come from?

616
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,360
After we finished our investigation yesterday

617
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,520
on his case,

618
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,800
I knew that at midnight

619
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
we had to attend the Devil Training Camp.

620
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,920
That's right.

621
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
So I thought

622
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,000
I should prepare a bit for the Devil Training Camp.

623
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
I wanted to sneak into the place ahead of time

624
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,600
to check it out.

625
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,200
Then, when I entered the tent area,

626
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,520
I also went to the tent area

627
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,240
and found this.

628
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,440
A poster for "Tie Bu Mountain Ghost Story Training Camp."

629
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
When I saw it at the time,

630
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,960
after reading the requirements on it,

631
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,360
I thought it was way too easy.

632
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
With requirements like these,

633
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,240
I could handle this kind of role in no time.

634
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,480
I'd win right away, right?

635
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,960
That's right, I can tell.

636
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,200
So I just took it with me.

637
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,280
After bringing it back, I thought

638
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,400
looking at the requirements on it,

639
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
I should practice a bit in private ahead of time.

640
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,760
Practice and get ready.

641
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,680
I already practiced in advance.

642
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
Come on, show us what you practiced.

643
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,600
No.

644
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Because it's already over.

645
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,800
He just mentioned the performance part

646
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,920
and the physical fitness part.

647
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
And then the whole process

648
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,760
was from when I went out and picked this up

649
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,920
to when I returned to the dorm

650
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,400
fifteen minutes

651
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,840
also fifteen minutes

652
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,480
Right

653
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
But when exactly did you leave

654
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,240
I don't really remember

655
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,600
Did you go to the assistant director to practice this

656
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,360
No, I just went there by myself

657
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
I didn't see the assistant director

658
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,960
At that time, the two of them were probably

659
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,280
rehearsing the kissing scene

660
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Why do you think they were rehearsing the kissing scene

661
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,320
Actually, I didn't think that

662
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,680
It was only after I heard his story

663
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,520
that I thought the two of them

664
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,440
Because you heard kissing

665
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,480
that sound, right? Or what was it

666
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,640
Then,

667
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,560
So what does this mean? I don't get it.

668
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,000
It's very simple.

669
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,560
I went into the tent area,

670
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,760
and I didn't find anything else.

671
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,840
I just picked up this.

672
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,160
And then...

673
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,920
Is anyone there?

674
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,280
You didn't notice?

675
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
You didn't find anything?

676
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,200
Why do you think the two of them

677
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,280
went somewhere else to kiss?

678
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,240
No way, that's not how it works, right?

679
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,360
That's how it is.

680
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
The assistant director must have been

681
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,480
sitting in this tent.

682
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,640
Right.

683
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,200
When you went to find him, you must have been in the tent.

684
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,040
He went to the tent and didn't see you two.

685
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,720
That means the assistant director wasn't there at that time.

686
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,400
And you weren't there either.

687
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,440
So you two weren't there at the same time.

688
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,400
You two...

689
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,880
You two...

690
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,560
Right.

691
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
So the timing might have been different.

692
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,040
Wait a minute.

693
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,640
When I went to the tent area,

694
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,680
I passed through

695
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,520
the food factory owner's office.

696
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
There's also a secret room in the owner's office.

697
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,280
Right.

698
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,560
That's the one from yesterday,

699
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,880
where we did the physical challenge.

700
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah, I went to the tent area.

701
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,360
And when I was coming back,

702
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,040
I knocked over a bucket of red paint.

703
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,040
So this is it, right?

704
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
These are your shoes, right?

705
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,760
Yes.

706
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,040
Next.

707
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,760
This is that Prince Charming.

708
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,360
Sunflower seeds.

709
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,040
Besides eating sunflower seeds, what else do you do?

710
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,480
You are mine.

711
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,880
It says on here,

712
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,560
Promote the 10-billion Devil Training Camp.

713
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,760
Be your own 10-billion actor.

714
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
I want to become a

715
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,120
superstar.

716
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
The last part is the most important.

717
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Promote the 10-billion Devil Training Camp.

718
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,440
Someone said

719
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,760
Single assistant director.

720
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,840
This is what I

721
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,400
just reinforced tonight, the load-bearing structure.

722
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,560
I'll hand-draw a copy for you.

723
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,800
This is the only copy, keep it safe.

724
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,520
The areas I marked in different colors

725
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,480
are the key points of the load-bearing structure.

726
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
On the actual structure,

727
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
I painted different colors.

728
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,520
If these four points are damaged,

729
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,400
the entire load-bearing structure will collapse.

730
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
So be sure to maintain them carefully.

731
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,840
There's a power box in the second-floor elevator lobby.

732
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
If the stairwell collapses,

733
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,360
the whole factory will lose power for three seconds.

734
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,280
Then the backup power will start.

735
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,840
Just a reminder.

736
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,640
When I came in to place these blueprints,

737
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,800
I also stepped in some paint.

738
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,880
I left a few footprints, sorry.

739
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,680
Promote construction.

740
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,280
So what's going on with this?

741
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,200
Why don't you explain?

742
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I don't know about this, I haven't seen it.

743
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,240
Then why was it in your pocket?

744
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,080
Because it was just wrapping the sunflower seeds.

745
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,560
I did the same thing that night.

746
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,360
I wanted to go over there and

747
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,160
chat with the extras, actors, and assistant director.

748
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,640
I just wanted to make some connections.

749
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
But when I got there, I couldn't find the assistant director.

750
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,080
There was only one person sitting there.

751
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,440
He was eating sunflower seeds.

752
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,600
So I thought I'd just chat with this guy.

753
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,120
We just made small talk for a bit.

754
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
We talked for about three or four minutes.

755
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,920
Three minutes.

756
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
Because he was eating sunflower seeds, right?

757
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,440
I started eating them too.

758
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,280
He thought I seemed to like eating them as well.

759
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,080
So he took some sunflower seeds from himself

760
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,120
wrapped them in paper, and gave them to me.

761
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,360
Then I left.

762
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,200
But when I went over, I also stepped on

763
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,560
paint.

764
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,040
Yeah, on paint.

765
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,080
Right.

766
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,720
When I stepped on the paint,

767
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,840
I already saw on the paint

768
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,360
that someone else had stepped on it before.

769
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,760
Yeah, that's how it was.

770
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,960
The whole thing only took about fifteen minutes.

771
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
So what you're saying is

772
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,480
you haven't seen this before?

773
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,920
I haven't seen it, I just...

774
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,440
He's just very simple.

775
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
He wrapped some sunflower seeds for me with a piece of paper.

776
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,600
In Director Shan's tent.

777
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,320
It wasn't in the tent.

778
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,720
I was by the coffee table in the main hall.

779
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,600
When you stepped on that paint...

780
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,080
I already saw it.

781
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,120
There were footprints on it, right?

782
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,480
Yes.

783
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,640
Actually, we're all the same.

784
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,520
When we go to the tent area,

785
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,320
we all have to pass through the boss's secret room.

786
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,680
That's right.

787
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
Yes, about fifteen minutes.

788
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,720
Come on.

789
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,920
I found this in my pocket.

790
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,720
Give me one.

791
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,360
A super high note that can move me.

792
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,560
Let me see what your voice is like.

793
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,600
What's this?

794
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,080
Not bad.

795
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,960
It's just too low.

796
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,760
Three, two, one.

797
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,320
You need to...

798
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,600
Go two octaves higher to be touching.

799
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,880
Three, two, one.

800
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
Three, two, one

801
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,360
That should be

802
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,280
rehearsing

803
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,440
I think so

804
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,120
I wanted to practice my high notes

805
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,320
So I wanted to talk to the assistant director

806
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I asked him to teach me how to sing high notes

807
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,240
Then he asked me to show him

808
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
Then he taught me some techniques

809
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
After he finished teaching me, I went back

810
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,400
It took about fifteen minutes

811
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,120
When I went there

812
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,400
I also stepped in the paint

813
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,440
Who knocked it over?

814
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,320
He did, he kicked it over

815
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
How am I supposed to clean up such a big mess?

816
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,800
Then just leave it

817
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,680
That's so irresponsible

818
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,320
I really...

819
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,880
If you were in a hurry to kill someone

820
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,400
I would understand

821
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
I think you don't care

822
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,640
Actually, that's true

823
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay

824
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
What did Ba go to do?

825
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,440
Did anyone find her things?

826
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What about mine?

827
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
What about mine?

828
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,880
The extras from the training camp have eaten here.

829
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,920
This is what you ate.

830
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,280
Yes.

831
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
We were speculating here.

832
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,200
We thought the culprit came over, starving, to eat.

833
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,360
An extra came over and ate something.

834
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,000
Actually,

835
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,160
Actually, at that time, I also

836
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,360
After finishing with the previous culprit,

837
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
I was really hungry.

838
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,880
Because it was free time then, right?

839
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,320
Right.

840
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,840
Then I walked by and saw some paint.

841
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,440
I walked past that

842
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,720
passageway between the boss and the secret room.

843
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
There was paint, and I stepped in it.

844
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,360
But I didn't pay attention to it.

845
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,440
Then I went to the extras' area and took

846
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,720
a boxed meal.

847
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
Spicy turkey noodles.

848
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
After I finished eating, I came back.

849
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,600
I came back and threw it here.

850
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,640
Then I just waited.

851
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,360
For our next round of training.

852
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,680
You also have paint on your shoes.

853
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,200
A bucket of red paint was knocked over.

854
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
There was paint, and I stepped in it.

855
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I also stepped in the paint.

856
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,440
When I stepped in the paint,

857
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,560
I already saw on the paint

858
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,080
that someone else had stepped on it before.

859
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
It has information about the paint on it.

860
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,720
After two and a half hours,

861
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
it will be completely dry.

862
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,520
So

863
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,880
so actually, this paint

864
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
from the moment you spill it

865
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,040
until two and a half hours later,

866
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,800
anyone stepping on it will leave a mark.

867
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,240
Right.

868
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,600
Yes.

869
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,600
Is there anyone without paint on their shoes?

870
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Yes, his shoes don't have any.

871
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,720
Because I was the one who knocked it over.

872
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,600
Right, you knocked it over.

873
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,320
You were the first one.

874
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,000
I think that piece of paper

875
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,560
represents

876
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
the five of us going there

877
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,880
and seeing that paper

878
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,960
was how we learned about the murder method.

879
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,480
Right.

880
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,920
Isn't that so?

881
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,480
Yes.

882
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,280
It can rule out Ke.

883
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,400
Why?

884
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,240
Because he said

885
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
when I came in to put down the paper,

886
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I stepped in the paint.

887
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,520
I left a few footprints, sorry.

888
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,480
He was the first one to go there.

889
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,720
He knocked this thing over.

890
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
From the soles of his shoes, we can tell

891
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,760
he didn't go back there again.

892
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,080
Do you understand?

893
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,520
You're ruled out.

894
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
Is it really that simple?

895
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,840
No way.

896
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Proving he didn't go back by looking at his shoe soles

897
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,360
what does that mean?

898
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
You're acting suspicious today.

899
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
These are his shoes, right?

900
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
The soles of his shoes are clean, aren't they?

901
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,720
That proves he only kicked it over.

902
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,320
So only this spot has it.

903
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,200
Just one round trip.

904
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,440
It means there was only one round trip.

905
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,040
Right.

906
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
So he's already been ruled out now.

907
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,960
Logically speaking.

908
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,760
It's too easy, I can't accept it.

909
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
For now, he's ruled out, right?

910
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,800
Maybe there will be some evidence later.

911
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,600
Most importantly, there's also this.

912
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,320
There's a power box in the stairwell on the second floor.

913
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,360
If the stairs collapse,

914
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,720
it would cause a three-second power outage in the whole factory.

915
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,560
This is related to this.

916
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
It says the extras should rehearse on their own.

917
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,280
During the first run-through,

918
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
the lighting needs to coordinate.

919
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,080
The lights should be on for three seconds, off for three seconds.

920
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,160
They should alternate in a strobe pattern.

921
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,720
So the power outage happens during the three seconds when the lights are off.

922
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,680
When I was streaming,

923
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,160
I was facing the window, sitting next to it.

924
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,360
I saw the building across from me.

925
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
That should be this building here.

926
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,280
Yes.

927
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,440
There was a sudden three-second power outage.

928
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,320
Then the lights came back on.

929
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
At 11:10,

930
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
I saw it go dark for three seconds.

931
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,680
That means their time of committing the crime

932
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
should be within this period.

933
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
11:10.

934
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
He took advantage of those three seconds

935
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,000
to strike.

936
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,360
It's enough that he knows this.

937
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,880
So Ke is a suspect again.

938
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
Because Ke is the one who found this note.

939
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
He knows about 11:10.

940
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,040
He's not a suspect.

941
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,080
The footprints show he's not a suspect.

942
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,480
That's enough to rule him out.

943
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,600
Don't drag him back into it.

944
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,400
Trust me, really.

945
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
That's what I think.

946
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
Whose recording was that just now?

947
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,360
It was Ning's, right?

948
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,360
Yes.

949
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,480
So, our choice for the female lead—

950
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,360
Do we have a preference?

951
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,080
This is the one from 23:10.

952
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,560
Rehearsal.

953
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
That incredible high note.

954
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Let me see what your vocal range is like.

955
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,760
There should be a "three, two, one."

956
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,360
Yes, right away.

957
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,960
Not bad.

958
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,760
It's just too low.

959
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,160
You need to do it again.

960
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,760
Did you hear that?

961
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,280
I mean, this could also rule me out.

962
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,200
In my recording,

963
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
it already proves there was a "three, two, one."

964
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,200
Was it at this time or that time?

965
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,720
I want to know.

966
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,480
It was at this time.

967
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,320
Because the director was involved in this.

968
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,080
All the "three, two, one"s

969
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,280
were called out by the director.

970
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
So this time, it was the director who called it.

971
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,640
You can hear it was someone else calling.

972
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,920
So it must have been 11:10 at that time.

973
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,320
Right.

974
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,840
You ruled it out.

975
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,520
You ruled out two people so quickly.

976
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,600
Okay.

977
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,120
That easy?

978
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
It's not that easy, picking one out of three is still easy?

979
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,720
I was ruled out too.

980
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,440
I was ruled out as well.

981
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,040
You were ruled out too.

982
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,000
How did you rule yourself out?

983
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,120
Just forced it.

984
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,160
Shut up.

985
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,560
Let's go search the factory again.

986
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,320
As for this right now,

987
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,520
I think both of us can be ruled out.

988
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,680
Temporarily rule me out too.

989
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Anyway, let's focus on those two as the main targets for now.

990
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,840
Those three are stirring things up together.

991
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
Now it's just the two of us left.

992
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,920
The two of us.

993
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,280
No, he hasn't been ruled out yet either.

994
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
How do you eliminate suspects?

995
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,960
You're being a bit shameless, aren't you?

996
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,400
Who keeps talking nonstop like that?

997
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,840
I'm begging you, just eliminate for now.

998
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
Let's narrow down the targets first.

999
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
Then those two started to panic.

1000
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
Maybe something new will come up.

1001
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
Because among the three of us,

1002
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,080
Relatively speaking, am I better?

1003
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
Why would the two of us be anxious?

1004
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,840
But let me tell you,

1005
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,760
It depends on the situation.

1006
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,960
I could also eliminate Ba.

1007
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,680
I also think her suspicion is a bit lighter.

1008
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,880
I think she's very suspicious today.

1009
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,160
Just because I asked you a question,

1010
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,120
His shoe soles prove he didn't go back.

1011
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
What does that mean?

1012
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
It's also because of that sentence.

1013
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,520
I think I can eliminate her as a suspect.

1014
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,600
Because if she were the culprit, she wouldn't understand.

1015
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,680
She wouldn't have asked.

1016
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
She was deliberately not listening.

1017
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm telling you, she's an excellent actress.

1018
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
You have to remember that.

1019
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,000
Of course I know.

1020
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,360
Thank you for acknowledging me.

1021
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,360
Say it again to the camera.

1022
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
I don't need to say it again.

1023
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
So she can change her state.

1024
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,040
Actually, this...

1025
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,880
She can't be eliminated.

1026
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,320
Anyway, it's just between those two.

1027
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,880
So it's just the two of us.

1028
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
Yeah, just those two.

1029
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
I also think it's one of those two.

1030
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,360
Really.

1031
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Alright, let's go to the factory.

1032
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Let's go, let's take a look at the factory.

1033
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,800
The factory is this way (out here).

1034
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,040
Who locked us in?

1035
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,120
Staff storage.

1036
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,480
Are we locked in?

1037
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,840
Then let's go to the staff storage room.

1038
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,160
Let's go find the key.

1039
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,280
Staff storage.

1040
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,040
Take a piece of bread.

1041
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,880
If that "zombie" comes over,

1042
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,480
when it opens its mouth, just stuff it in.

1043
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,960
No.

1044
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,720
They're extras.

1045
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
They're not staff.

1046
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,320
Be careful.

1047
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,880
Why do they have to get so close to us?

1048
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,960
He won't stop unless he hears "cut."

1049
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
Cut.

1050
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
It's you guys, come in quickly.

1051
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
It's safer over here.

1052
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,040
Get inside, quickly.

1053
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,760
Come in first.

1054
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,840
Why are you here?

1055
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,640
Why shouldn't we be here?

1056
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,800
The company notified everyone yesterday

1057
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
that we don't need to come to work.

1058
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,880
And now the whole company is on lockdown.

1059
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,639
You guys...

1060
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,840
We don't know.

1061
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,760
Why did they lock down the company?

1062
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,480
I also stayed late to work overtime yesterday.

1063
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,760
Then when I woke up, I got the news.

1064
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
All the colleagues who worked overtime with me yesterday

1065
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,400
have already turned into monsters.

1066
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,840
They've become "zombies."

1067
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,760
So it's real, they're actually zombies.

1068
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,199
So they were infected by the virus.

1069
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:24,840
They are...

1070
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,800
Has anyone here been bitten?

1071
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,920
Yes.

1072
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,199
No.

1073
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,679
Wait, look.

1074
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,320
Such deep bite marks.

1075
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,920
What are you talking about?

1076
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
No.

1077
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,199
Did you? Were you bitten just now?

1078
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,280
She was bitten too.

1079
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,800
She was bitten.

1080
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,960
Now both Ba Mian Linglong and Prince Charming

1081
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,520
have been bitten.

1082
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,360
That means they might turn into monsters.

1083
00:34:59,680 --> 00:34:59,840
Like this

1084
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,400
we're doing this to prove our friendship.

1085
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,840
Come on.

1086
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,640
I thought we should drive them out first

1087
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,040
before they turn into monsters.

1088
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,240
There might be some reactions,

1089
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,000
like being afraid of cold, heat,

1090
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,960
or dolphin sounds.

1091
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,800
Dolphin sounds?

1092
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Right. If you two

1093
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,760
don't have these symptoms,

1094
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,320
then you're still safe for now.

1095
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,600
Afraid of cold, heat, or dolphin sounds?

1096
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Try making a dolphin sound.

1097
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
They're actually pretty sensitive

1098
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,080
to sounds.

1099
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
Sensitive, huh?

1100
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,840
So if we drive them away like this,

1101
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,680
they'll leave.

1102
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,040
Make a dolphin sound.

1103
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,960
Dolphin sound.

1104
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,720
Dolphin sound.

1105
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,320
No.

1106
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,040
No wonder they didn't attack me just now.

1107
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
No, I mean we should try our best

1108
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
not to run into them.

1109
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Right, she told you not to make any noise.

1110
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,760
And then you said you would try to make noise.

1111
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,880
What kind of logic is that?

1112
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,000
The whole building is locked down now.

1113
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,960
And the person who got locked in

1114
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,720
took the key.

1115
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,960
So now I need to check

1116
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,400
if there are any other safe exits.

1117
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,560
So what should we do?

1118
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
I've already checked this room.

1119
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,800
It's safe in here.

1120
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,040
So you don't need to be afraid.

1121
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
You can stay here for now.

1122
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,360
Okay.

1123
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,320
How could we bear

1124
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,440
to let you go out and search alone?

1125
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,080
It's fine.

1126
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,600
Men only slow down my sword-drawing speed.

1127
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,720
So I'll go by myself.

1128
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Right.

1129
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Okay.

1130
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Keep your voice down.

1131
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,080
Okay.

1132
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,560
Alright.

1133
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
If she transforms, just let her out first.

1134
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,040
Otherwise,

1135
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,800
at this very moment,

1136
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,040
is there anything else we need to look for here?

1137
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,200
If we set off another smoke bomb,

1138
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,960
what would happen?

1139
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,600
No one would save you.

1140
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,720
Because all the security guards have left.

1141
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,240
If we set off another smoke bomb,

1142
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,600
we'd suffocate to death.

1143
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,760
That's what would happen.

1144
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,920
There's one here.

1145
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,360
"Ghost Blows Out the Light"

1146
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,720
Seventeen

1147
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,560
Ba Mian Linglong plays Deng Shiqi

1148
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:10,880
So handsome

1149
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,760
I really want to see you two act together

1150
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,520
Who

1151
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,080
Has anyone given you a script

1152
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,600
Talking about me

1153
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,640
Talking about me

1154
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
"Dead Ghost Blows Out the Lamp"

1155
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,080
That one, number eighteen, number seventeen

1156
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,640
So good

1157
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,720
They’re so good

1158
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Why haven’t the two of them acted together yet

1159
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,880
Is there nothing else

1160
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,920
There’s something here

1161
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,600
They’re all medical kits

1162
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,680
This one

1163
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,120
Temporarily stored in the public area of the Billion Office Building

1164
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,600
Bracelet

1165
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,080
Whose is this

1166
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,640
What is this

1167
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,800
This string

1168
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Who likes strings the most

1169
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,080
Do you see me paying attention to you

1170
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,040
No, okay

1171
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,760
It’s not me, really not me

1172
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,640
What does this mean

1173
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Wait a second

1174
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
There’s paint on this

1175
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,000
Is this paint on it

1176
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,680
There’s colored paint on this

1177
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,400
Are there any symbols or anything

1178
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,800
For example

1179
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,960
For example, the orphanage

1180
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,040
I grew up in an orphanage

1181
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,720
It’s so obvious

1182
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
Who is each of us targeting

1183
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,560
It’s really obvious

1184
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,240
There’s a character on it

1185
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,080
Ba

1186
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,120
No, I'm not joking.

1187
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,040
You have one too.

1188
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,080
This isn't from the show, is it?

1189
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Isn't this the symbol from "Candle in the Tomb"?

1190
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,760
Maybe.

1191
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,720
Just lock in the culprit directly.

1192
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,560
I already said I was ruled out.

1193
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,440
Is the case solved this quickly?

1194
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,160
Is it really that simple?

1195
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,480
Is that so?

1196
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
This could be for filming.

1197
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,760
It's just something from the crew.

1198
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,640
It's meant to frame those two.

1199
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,240
This thing either directly pins it on them,

1200
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,400
or directly rules them out.

1201
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,840
Right.

1202
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,960
So who else is left?

1203
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,600
Let's see.

1204
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,040
This one's locked in too, right?

1205
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,080
The silent Prince Charming.

1206
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,400
That's me.

1207
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,800
Hurry, go.

1208
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,640
Hurry, go.

1209
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,360
Hurry, go.

1210
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
I'm dying of laughter.

1211
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,640
You scared me!

1212
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
I was just about to eat some bread.

1213
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,040
If you hear this, please respond.

1214
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,440
If you hear this, please respond. Hurry!

1215
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,560
If you hear this, please respond.

1216
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,040
Who is it?

1217
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,120
Walkie-talkie.

1218
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,920
Is anyone there?

1219
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,440
Someone's here.

1220
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,160
Hurry up.

1221
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,720
Hurry up.

1222
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,480
I was just in the parking lot.

1223
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,600
I found a way to escape.

1224
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,720
Okay.

1225
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,600
Tell me, quick!

1226
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,480
I remember one of our coworkers

1227
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,960
has a car in the parking lot.

1228
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
But I don't have the key.

1229
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,400
The key is in the office.

1230
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,240
The key.

1231
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,000
The locker against the wall is his.

1232
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,520
So once you get the key,

1233
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,080
come down to the parking lot and meet me.

1234
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
We'll drive out together.

1235
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,880
That one, it has the key.

1236
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,680
Turn on the light.

1237
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,160
Done.

1238
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,640
So it's this door, right?

1239
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,560
How tall is it?

1240
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,840
He said, "Don't ask me how tall I am."

1241
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,480
What does that mean?

1242
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,400
The lock is a combination lock.

1243
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,680
188

1244
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
188 is not right.

1245
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,760
189

1246
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,280
Is it the average height?

1247
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,040
Average height.

1248
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
It's possible.

1249
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,640
No way, it's not.

1250
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,680
He put a ruler here.

1251
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,320
Is there a reason for that?

1252
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,800
No.

1253
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,160
It can't be just one person's height.

1254
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,760
Otherwise, it would be too easy.

1255
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,080
Right.

1256
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,360
Measure.

1257
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,600
No, measuring is useless.

1258
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,240
Measuring doesn't help.

1259
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,800
What we're measuring now definitely has

1260
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,360
some variation.

1261
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,840
There's variation.

1262
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
Variation, it's not accurate.

1263
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,360
Measure.

1264
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,240
Let's measure, then.

1265
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,320
Okay, two meters.

1266
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,200
You measured two meters.

1267
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Two meters.

1268
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,960
Hurry up.

1269
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,520
The "zombies" are about to come out.

1270
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,880
Block the door.

1271
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
It's over, they're all out.

1272
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,800
Is anyone blocking the door?

1273
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,360
I'm blocking it.

1274
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,040
Okay.

1275
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,920
Just put your foot here.

1276
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,640
Put your foot here.

1277
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,800
What about the door over there?

1278
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,160
Average height, what?

1279
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,160
188 plus 189.

1280
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,800
Add.

1281
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,720
Use this to calculate.

1282
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Divide by the six of us.

1283
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,160
Except for six people

1284
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,480
179

1285
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,320
179

1286
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,880
179

1287
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
Maybe 180

1288
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,480
180

1289
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,640
Try 179 or 180

1290
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,960
179, 180

1291
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,880
Try 179

1292
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,040
Can you hurry up?

1293
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
We're trying

1294
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,400
Don't ask me how tall something is

1295
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,400
Is this the lyric?

1296
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,120
Don't ask me how high the sun is

1297
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,400
Don't ask me about the sun

1298
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,120
Don't ask me how high the sun is

1299
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,600
The sun? Who is the sun?

1300
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,560
So who is the sun?

1301
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,360
What is the sun?

1302
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,280
Who is the sun?

1303
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,160
Where is the sun?

1304
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,040
In the sky

1305
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,920
Don't ask me how high the sun is

1306
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,480
Where is the sun?

1307
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,040
Here

1308
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,440
Here

1309
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,680
This

1310
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,600
How tall is this?

1311
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,160
How tall is this?

1312
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,440
How much is this?

1313
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,120
200

1314
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,760
Still not right.

1315
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,880
It hasn't been solved yet.

1316
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,600
Where else is there a sun?

1317
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,520
Where else is the sun?

1318
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,320
Sun.

1319
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,800
Hurry.

1320
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,360
Sunflower, is there a sunflower?

1321
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
Sunflower, sunflower potted plant.

1322
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,160
Isn't that a potted plant in front of us?

1323
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,240
Is it this one?

1324
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,120
This is a banana.

1325
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,280
This is a banana.

1326
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,640
You are the sun.

1327
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,920
You are my flower.

1328
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,120
Could it be yours?

1329
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,560
Hurry up.

1330
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,520
Is it those two behind you?

1331
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,600
These two pots, what are they?

1332
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Can't block it anymore.

1333
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,240
This one, this says "sun kumquat."

1334
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,560
Measure this one, measure this one.

1335
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,960
Got it.

1336
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,960
How tall?

1337
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,520
Tell me.

1338
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:13,920
47.

1339
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,760
It's the sun kumquat, right?

1340
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,280
47.

1341
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,040
46, 47.

1342
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,800
46

1343
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,400
There is, right?

1344
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,320
There's no 47 either.

1345
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,920
Start trying from 90.

1346
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,480
Try the next ones.

1347
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,360
Okay, 90.

1348
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,160
090

1349
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,040
Is that measured with the basin?

1350
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:36,880
Let's go.

1351
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,680
Let's take a break.

1352
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,600
Is there something wrong with our ruler?

1353
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,000
He was looking at the back, that's not in inches.

1354
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,800
He really messed up.

1355
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,760
Seriously.

1356
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,400
118

1357
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,880
116

1358
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,280
234

1359
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:54,960
Alright, come on.

1360
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,000
Let's go.

1361
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
Let's go.

1362
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,920
Go, hurry.

1363
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,680
Let's go.

1364
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,640
Go, hurry.

1365
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,800
It's fine.

1366
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,720
It's fine.

1367
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,320
Okay.

1368
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,160
Hurry, get the car keys.

1369
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,400
Hurry, get the car keys.

1370
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
You were way too careless.

1371
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,720
You opened the door so quickly.

1372
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,240
In the cabinet

1373
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,200
Yuan Gong, what does "all Yuan Gong" mean?

1374
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,960
Car keys

1375
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,960
Grab them and run

1376
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,160
Hurry, go

1377
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,800
Quick

1378
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,080
Go

1379
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,640
Hurry, go

1380
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,720
Quick, go

1381
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,200
Get in

1382
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,160
Hurry, go

1383
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,400
This is terrifying

1384
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,000
What is this?

1385
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,560
Who is this?

1386
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,760
Yuan Gong

1387
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,400
That boy just now, wedding photo

1388
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,480
Those two who turned into "zombies" just now

1389
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,120
Those two, right?

1390
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,520
Whose car keys are these?

1391
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,600
So we're going to steal from them later

1392
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,560
Take their car, those two

1393
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,920
There might be more outside

1394
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,240
There can't be more, right?

1395
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,320
Come here

1396
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,680
Keep your voice down

1397
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,360
What?

1398
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,000
Come in

1399
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,640
I'm so scared

1400
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,120
When I finally escape

1401
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,960
I have to book on Tongcheng Travel

1402
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,120
A room facing the sea

1403
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,280
And have a proper vacation

1404
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,560
For the sake of our life-and-death friendship

1405
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,280
You have to teach me too

1406
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,560
I want to set off with Tongcheng too

1407
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,800
What? You don't know how to book?

1408
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,840
Just open WeChat services

1409
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,200
Then we can find it.

1410
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,760
Hotels, homestays, train tickets, plane tickets.

1411
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,960
Unbeatable low prices can't be hidden.

1412
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,200
Premium product.

1413
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,160
Traveling with Tongcheng really saves a lot.

1414
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,840
Super convenient.

1415
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,240
Did you get the key?

1416
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,000
Got it.

1417
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,760
This...

1418
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,560
License plate.

1419
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,600
The license plate is...

1420
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,880
A192CM.

1421
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,480
192 centimeters.

1422
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,400
Then look for the car, look for the license plate.

1423
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,440
Keep your voice down.

1424
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,640
Here.

1425
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,560
Hurry up.

1426
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,520
Is it this one?

1427
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,040
Get in the car.

1428
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,360
Here.

1429
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,080
Get in.

1430
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,400
Get in.

1431
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,080
Move inside.

1432
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
The car key...

1433
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,680
It's here.

1434
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,840
Give it to him.

1435
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,080
Where to?

1436
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,560
What should we do?

1437
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,440
Wait, there's this.

1438
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,560
Hurry up.

1439
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,800
Can we drive first?

1440
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,120
Yes, we need to go quickly.

1441
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,200
But this gear doesn't work.

1442
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,160
We can't go, this car is broken.

1443
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,600
What should we do?

1444
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,960
The gear is broken.

1445
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,080
We can't go.

1446
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,160
Hurry up.

1447
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,000
Brother Bai.

1448
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,560
This car won't start.

1449
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,440
Don't turn it on.

1450
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,920
Use the light.

1451
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,760
Do you have a flashlight?

1452
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,520
Flashlight.

1453
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,000
There's light.

1454
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Use the light, they're scared, hurry!

1455
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,800
The roof of the car.

1456
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,800
The roof.

1457
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,400
Hurry, go! Go!

1458
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,560
You guys, hurry, go!

1459
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,000
Hurry, go!

1460
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,680
Go down.

1461
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,240
Is there a way up there?

1462
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,200
Go that way, go!

1463
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,280
Hurry!

1464
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,640
Quickly!

1465
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,400
Hurry!

1466
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,440
You go first.

1467
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,760
Hurry, go!

1468
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,120
Hurry!

1469
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,640
Hurry, go!

1470
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,080
Hurry!

1471
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,840
Quickly!

1472
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,040
This way.

1473
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,760
This.

1474
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,800
Where is the person?

1475
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,760
This way.

1476
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,040
This way.

1477
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,520
This way.

1478
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,560
Hurry, come in!

1479
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,360
Hurry, come in!

1480
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,840
Come in.

1481
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,160
Close the door.

1482
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,040
Wait a moment.

1483
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,920
Close the door.

1484
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,800
Wait a moment.

1485
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,640
Go to the rooftop.

1486
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,040
Go to the rooftop.

1487
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,960
The elevator can't come down.

1488
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,680
What about the stairs?

1489
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,200
We can go this way.

1490
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,320
Take this trash away.

1491
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,280
The elevator is here.

1492
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,520
Hurry up.

1493
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,160
Quick, come on!

1494
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,760
Go.

1495
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,080
What do we do? She was dragged away by the monster.

1496
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,720
What should we do?

1497
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,520
This door can't hold much longer.

1498
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,000
You go first.

1499
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,640
Can't this be locked?

1500
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,440
It can't be locked.

1501
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,680
When I say three, two, one, we all run together.

1502
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,040
Three, two, one.

1503
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,840
Run!

1504
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,440
Hurry!

1505
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:22,880
Out!

1506
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,720
Go quickly.

1507
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,840
Close it.

1508
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,280
Lock it.

1509
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Are you okay?

1510
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,680
Up.

1511
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,000
No need.

1512
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Where do we go now?

1513
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,600
To the rooftop.

1514
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
You scared me.

1515
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,360
Wait, so who are we waiting for?

1516
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,440
We're waiting to catch our breath.

1517
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,600
There's a "zombie" here.

1518
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,160
There's someone here.

1519
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,480
It's fine, just keep our voices down.

1520
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,920
Just keep it down.

1521
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,400
Just keep it down.

1522
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,560
Don't make any noise.

1523
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,720
It's tied up.

1524
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,200
Something's coming from below.

1525
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,960
Something's coming from below, go!

1526
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,440
Hurry!

1527
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,880
Move this over here.

1528
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,840
Okay, here you go.

1529
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,000
Like this, that's good.

1530
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,080
Just make sure it's stuck in place.

1531
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,600
Right.

1532
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,320
Here.

1533
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,120
Do you want to take a look at this?

1534
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,880
I was rushing around in the car just now.

1535
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,680
I'm all sweaty.

1536
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,120
Wait, there's this.

1537
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,720
The third floor of the factory next door has never been open to outsiders.

1538
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,400
Neither the stairs

1539
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,480
nor the elevator can get you in.

1540
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,360
But on the third floor,

1541
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,520
there's a window without glass.

1542
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,400
I saw a figure there.

1543
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,320
Later, I even found this document he left behind.

1544
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,320
Subject

1545
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,880
Individual carrying the original infection source gene

1546
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,360
A-Guai

1547
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,760
Objective

1548
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,280
Study the effects of the gene virus on the human body

1549
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,600
This virus may be transmitted through bites

1550
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,280
Predict the condition of those infected after being bitten

1551
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,760
(Non-original carriers) symptoms

1552
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,280
Will go through the following stages

1553
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,720
Early stage: sensitivity to cold, heat, and dolphin-like sounds

1554
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,800
Next, loss of rationality

1555
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,880
And finally

1556
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,600
After eight hours

1557
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,440
Death

1558
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,640
The infected person dies completely

1559
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,200
Loss of rationality

1560
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,000
Skin shows

1561
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,320
Biting their own arm

1562
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,520
So that's the person we saw yesterday

1563
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,560
At that time, he

1564
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,800
suddenly bit

1565
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,160
his own right elbow

1566
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,440
Suddenly bit his elbow

1567
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,560
He was infected

1568
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:18,920
Yes

1569
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,760
But he was not

1570
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,120
an original carrier of the virus

1571
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,960
You started to feel itchy.

1572
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,920
You got bitten.

1573
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,400
No, I'm just itchy on my own.

1574
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,720
Just itchy by myself.

1575
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,920
So you were bitten by a mosquito.

1576
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,600
There's one last thing.

1577
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
After the infected person dies completely,

1578
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,120
they regain mobility through an unknown mechanism

1579
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,520
and display a strong predatory instinct.

1580
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,360
Like those monsters from earlier.

1581
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,520
These infected can't be killed easily.

1582
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,720
The only effective way

1583
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,360
is to inflict fatal damage to the head.

1584
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Other than that,

1585
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,680
there are still other methods.

1586
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,320
It's not written here.

1587
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,000
Lastly,

1588
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,400
what's written under this photo

1589
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,600
is that a strange person was photographed.

1590
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,360
Is it an extra?

1591
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,480
It kind of looks like it.

1592
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,080
On the document we found,

1593
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:05,840
it says

1594
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,720
"infection victim."

1595
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,120
This person has red hair.

1596
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,880
One sleeve is missing.

1597
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,960
It's that guy.

1598
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,480
At 8:30 in the evening,

1599
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,040
it was him.

1600
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,840
Eight hours later,

1601
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,000
the infected person completely dies,

1602
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,560
loses all reason,

1603
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,400
and the skin shows

1604
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,040
He was infected at 12:30.

1605
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,520
Yes.

1606
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,320
It means the infected person is completely dead.

1607
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,000
That person is already dead.

1608
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,240
But the body is in this

1609
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:31,760
mechanical state.

1610
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,480
An excited state.

1611
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,000
Yes.

1612
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,160
Then he bites his own arm.

1613
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,960
That was at 8:30 in the evening.

1614
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,840
By then, he had already turned into a monster.

1615
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,240
So if you really used a sledgehammer

1616
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:41,720
to kill him,

1617
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,760
you are not the murderer.

1618
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:42,960
Yes.

1619
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,160
The real murderer

1620
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,560
is the one who gave him the poison.

1621
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,000
Yes.

1622
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,960
So, whoever smashed the wall, raise your hand.

1623
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,840
Come forward.

1624
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,800
Who smashed the wall, now?

1625
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,880
The person who smashed the wall can turn themselves in now.

1626
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,280
Because you didn't kill a normal person.

1627
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,360
You killed a monster.

1628
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,640
Yes, so it's okay.

1629
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,880
Go ahead and say it boldly.

1630
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,080
So where do we go now?

1631
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,040
Yeah, where are we going?

1632
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,680
This whole building is full of monsters.

1633
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,400
The third floor of the factory next door has never been open to the public.

1634
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,120
Whether it's the stairs

1635
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,360
or the elevator, you can't get in.

1636
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,200
Guys,

1637
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,840
I think we should go

1638
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,040
check out the third floor of the factory across the street.

1639
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,040
Yeah, let's go to the third floor.

1640
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,880
But how do we get to the third floor?

1641
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,600
What's in here?

1642
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,360
Emergency escape equipment.

1643
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,600
Here, we'll need this.

1644
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,040
We're done for.

1645
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,320
We're doomed.

1646
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,640
I don't dare.

1647
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,200
Wait, why?

1648
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,160
We have to rappel down, we have to rappel.

1649
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,360
Wire harness.

1650
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,160
Harness.

1651
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,040
Harness.

1652
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,080
Wire harness.

1653
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,880
Guys,

1654
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,120
Most people wouldn't dare do this.

1655
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,480
What is it?

1656
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,880
Vertical descent.

1657
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,360
It's like what firefighters use.

1658
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,040
Assault.

1659
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,200
What do I do? I really can't do this.

1660
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,880
Seriously?

1661
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,840
No way.

1662
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,800
I want to take a look.

1663
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,680
Just this?

1664
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,200
Just this?

1665
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,720
This.

1666
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,760
That.

1667
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,560
Those two.

1668
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,240
This is so cool.

1669
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,040
No.

1670
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,240
As the detective for this round,

1671
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,840
I ask the culprit

1672
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,920
to confess right now.

1673
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,120
I'm telling you, be careful.

1674
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,240
The culprit might

1675
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,720
be hiding among the six of us.

1676
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,600
They might try to silence someone.

1677
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,640
If someone dies, it makes it easier for them to escape.

1678
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,600
That's one less vote against them.

1679
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,240
So we should secure the harnesses ourselves.

1680
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,600
Let's see who will help with the harnesses.

1681
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,760
Here, I'll help you put them on.

1682
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,440
Okay.

1683
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,120
Don't worry.

1684
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,560
So that's how we're playing, huh?

1685
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,600
Let's do it.

1686
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,560
But are we supposed to set up this device ourselves?

1687
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,880
I see there's one over there.

1688
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,680
They're also avoiding the monster.

1689
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,760
There's a safety officer for the escape device.

1690
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,240
He should be able to help us.

1691
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,520
Let's put on the safety gear first.

1692
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
Okay.

1693
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,040
Let's go.

1694
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,480
Are we going to the third floor?

1695
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,840
How do we get up there?

1696
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
We probably need to go down this rope

1697
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,760
and then swing into that window.

1698
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
Swing into that window

1699
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,800
Yeah, that should be it

1700
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,480
No way we can swing over, man

1701
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,640
Swing from here to there

1702
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,440
Impossible

1703
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,440
Do you think we're in a cartoon?

1704
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,360
There's a lift over there

1705
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,160
We should be able to take the lift, right?

1706
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,360
Because everything over there is locked

1707
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,440
Go in through the window

1708
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,080
Nonsense

1709
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,040
Seriously, isn't there a lift right there?

1710
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:08,720
Whether it's the stairs

1711
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,040
or the elevator, we can't get in

1712
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,280
That's right, it's possible

1713
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,480
Yeah, our first step is from here

1714
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,320
Rappel down

1715
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:14,760
Right

1716
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,320
Right?

1717
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,640
And there's a lift over there, right?

1718
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,840
Yeah. Who knows how to operate it?

1719
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,480
I do.

1720
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,520
You can give it a try.

1721
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,520
Okay.

1722
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,280
Alright.

1723
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,480
Let's do two people per group.

1724
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,360
Let's split into groups.

1725
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:28,680
How about this, then?

1726
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,080
Okay.

1727
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,560
Alright, I'll team up with Ke.

1728
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:31,960
Sounds good.

1729
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,040
The two of us.

1730
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,920
Alright, the two of us then.

1731
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,600
Okay.

1732
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,680
Then it's us two.

1733
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,400
That's fine.

1734
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,280
Alright, let's do our best.

1735
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,840
Come on.

1736
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,200
Let's go.

1737
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,640
Let's go!

1738
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,920
Three, two, one, go!

1739
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,760
Let's move.

1740
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,040
Wait, how do we get down?

1741
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,440
Hold on.

1742
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,640
If this really happens...

1743
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,320
I think there will still be a bit of...

1744
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,400
...fear.

1745
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,000
Just now we were saying how fun this is.

1746
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,000
This is so cool.

1747
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,280
I have a suggestion.

1748
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,520
Let the guys go down first.

1749
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,320
They don't dawdle, they're faster.

1750
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,920
Honestly, I'm a bit scared.

1751
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,120
Then we'll go down first.

1752
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,560
No problem.

1753
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,360
The two of us will go first.

1754
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,120
Doesn't matter.

1755
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,160
Let's do it.

1756
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,040
Yes.

1757
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,320
No.

1758
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,240
No, what?

1759
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,320
Is it okay?

1760
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,480
I want to see how they go down.

1761
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,720
You guys are amazing.

1762
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,880
How is that possible?

1763
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,960
Can I go out?

1764
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,480
You can.

1765
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,680
Let it feel it loosening slowly. That's fine.

1766
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,160
Okay.

1767
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,440
Come on.

1768
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,080
Alright.

1769
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,200
Get ready to descend.

1770
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,040
He still has his hands in his pockets.

1771
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,160
No, his hands are here.

1772
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,400
They're not in his pockets.

1773
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,600
He's holding the rope.

1774
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,480
I can't, I already feel like crying. What should I do?

1775
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,200
It's okay.

1776
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,600
It feels pretty slow.

1777
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,800
I think it's pretty slow.

1778
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,560
You're the one controlling it.

1779
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,200
It's just what you see here.

1780
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,520
Yeah, because it's high up here.

1781
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,840
So it feels really scary.

1782
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,480
It's okay.

1783
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,680
You've been on a wire before, right?

1784
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,120
You've never been on a wire?

1785
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,960
No, I haven't. I haven't really acted much.

1786
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,240
No, I haven't. I haven't really acted much.

1787
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,240
So for you,

1788
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,640
this is definitely pretty new.

1789
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,640
It's a completely new experience.

1790
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,120
For you.

1791
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:25,720
Yeah.

1792
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,960
Guys,

1793
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,320
you can do it!

1794
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,040
Are you two scared?

1795
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,080
How about the two of us go down first?

1796
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,200
No, if you go down,

1797
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,240
I'll be even more scared if I'm left here.

1798
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,320
I've already thought about it.

1799
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,760
We were supposed to go down first just now.

1800
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,120
But because we were scared, we let them go first.

1801
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,840
Don't worry, it's very stable.

1802
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,560
Okay, let's go.

1803
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,720
Come on.

1804
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,440
You can do it, go for it!

1805
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,160
Are you ready?

1806
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,720
Ready.

1807
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,640
You got this!

1808
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,200
A Jin.

1809
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,160
A Ba.

1810
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,240
But why isn't my left hand listening to me?

1811
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,440
It won't let go.

1812
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:36,680
You can do it!

1813
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,440
Keep going!

1814
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,280
Come on!

1815
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,120
Don't look down, it's okay.

1816
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,080
It's all right.

1817
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,240
Wait, hold on.

1818
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,800
Okay.

1819
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,160
It's fine.

1820
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,520
I'm about to cry.

1821
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Sit down lower.

1822
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,240
You sit down lower.

1823
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:57,760
That's right.

1824
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,120
How about this?

1825
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,800
Maybe take a bit more time to prepare yourself.

1826
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,080
Let those two go first.

1827
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,560
Take your time, okay?

1828
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,160
That's fine, let someone else go first.

1829
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:26,680
You go, or I'll go.

1830
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,080
Let me do it.

1831
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,000
It's okay.

1832
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,600
Come on.

1833
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,200
Come on.

1834
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,080
It's okay.

1835
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,880
Let's go.

1836
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,880
You can do it!

1837
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,960
Okay, here we go.

1838
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:02,960
Is it okay?

1839
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,400
Okay, it's fine.

1840
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,280
Is it okay?

1841
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,080
Okay, it's fine.

1842
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,200
It's still okay.

1843
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,520
Feels like sitting.

1844
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,960
It's not scary, right?

1845
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,200
Just that moment when you go out.

1846
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:17,560
Yeah.

1847
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,680
It's not scary, you're sitting.

1848
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,760
You can let go when you're ready.

1849
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,080
Slowly.

1850
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,840
Go down slowly, right?

1851
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,160
Ning, take a look down there.

1852
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,960
You're so bad.

1853
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,760
You two look so relaxed watching.

1854
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,880
You two.

1855
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,400
Actually, we haven't gone very far.

1856
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,200
Almost there.

1857
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,040
Aba is about to reach the ground.

1858
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,360
You're still up there.

1859
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,200
Stop making a fuss, be quiet.

1860
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,840
Let's add some music ourselves.

1861
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,840
The kind that's like...

1862
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,680
Okay.

1863
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,400
I'll go find a spot first.

1864
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,680
That way, if a monster shows up later,

1865
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,520
we can still hide.

1866
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,400
It's a bit too dangerous for you to go alone.

1867
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,760
Let's go with you.

1868
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,440
Okay.

1869
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,120
Come on.

1870
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,640
It's starting again.

1871
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,800
Sis.

1872
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:19,800
Sis.

1873
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,160
My left hand

1874
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,600
can't let go of this pole at all.

1875
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:26,880
I'll just hold your elbow.

1876
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:28,960
Are you scared?

1877
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,560
I'm scared too.

1878
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,800
I'm nervous too.

1879
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,359
Of course.

1880
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,279
This is pretty high.

1881
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm actually pretty afraid of heights.

1882
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,200
Don't worry, it's very stable.

1883
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,560
Actually, I'm a little scared.

1884
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,080
It's like sitting.

1885
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,359
It's not scary, you're sitting.

1886
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,720
I'm scared too.

1887
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,960
I'm also nervous.

1888
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,520
Definitely.

1889
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,480
You can do it.

1890
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,320
Don't look down, it's okay.

1891
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,280
It's all right.

1892
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,160
I can do it.

1893
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,160
Give me a hand.

1894
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,720
You have to hold here with this hand.

1895
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:24,960
Don't worry.

1896
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,360
This time, let's hold it together.

1897
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,160
Right.

1898
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,600
I've let go, I've let go.

1899
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,720
Okay.

1900
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,080
It's out, relax.

1901
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,680
Relax, yes.

1902
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,120
Yes, let go slowly.

1903
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,920
Yes.

1904
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,520
Okay.

1905
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,280
Okay.

1906
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,000
Slow down.

1907
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,240
Okay, watch me.

1908
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,800
Sister Jin, look at me.

1909
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,320
It's okay.

1910
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,680
Nothing will happen, don't worry.

1911
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,800
It's fine.

1912
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,120
It's all right.

1913
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,360
It's all right.

1914
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,760
It's all right.

1915
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,960
A third of the way there.

1916
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,240
Look.

1917
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,680
Where are you?

1918
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,640
I'm here.

1919
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,840
I'm above you.

1920
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,680
I don't dare look at you.

1921
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,400
No, nothing will happen, don't worry.

1922
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,120
Just one more level, keep going!

1923
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,640
Brother Ning's height is the current height.

1924
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,480
Your foot is already on my head now.

1925
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,560
I'm holding you, see?

1926
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,880
Where?

1927
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,560
I'm almost there.

1928
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,880
Can't you hear my voice?

1929
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,560
Three.

1930
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,560
Two.

1931
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,720
One.

1932
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,640
Okay, come on.

1933
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,280
You can do it!

1934
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,680
Okay.

1935
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,520
Made it.

1936
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,160
Relax.

1937
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:09,920
All done.

1938
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,280
It's fine.

1939
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,520
Alright, just untie it and it'll be fine.

1940
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,000
No problem.

1941
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,640
Feels okay.

1942
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,360
Okay.

1943
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,720
Where are you going?

1944
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,920
Okay.

1945
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,880
Not bad, bro.

1946
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,760
Yeah.

1947
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,080
"Zombie"

1948
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,160
Hurry and find Ba

1949
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:37,800
Let's hide for now

1950
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:38,680
Run!

1951
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,160
Hurry!

1952
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,520
Studying the effects of the gene virus on the human body

1953
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,160
Eight hours later

1954
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:46,680
Death

1955
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,600
Everyone in the building started to mutate

1956
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,000
What is his goal?

1957
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,400
Someone wants to protect you

1958
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,160
Strange tales of deduction

1959
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,800
Horror legends

1960
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,960
I have so many friends

1961
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,480
Friends like those in fairy tales

1962
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,600
They used darkness to heal me

1963
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,280
In the end, they made me a part of the darkness

1964
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,520
Is it my friend who came back to kill me?

1965
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,880
Mistakenly thought someone came to kill him

1966
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,080
But when you see this person

1967
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,760
You know he's not my friend

1968
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,640
It's not like I saw your face and stabbed you

1969
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,000
The killer has been here

1970
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,240
This photo is also at 8:30

1971
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:11,520
So

1972
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,920
Actually, before he was smashed or stabbed to death

1973
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
He had already

1974
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,200
already turned into a monster

1975
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,600
What do you mean, there are two killers?

1976
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,920
I've already been bitten.

1977
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,000
I'll lock myself up.

1978
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,640
What is this place?

1979
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,240
Observation room.

1980
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,280
A place where zombies are made.

1981
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,120
Right here.

1982
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,520
This is where experiments are done.

1983
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,280
On this wall,

1984
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,880
there are marks from someone being grabbed.

1985
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,480
This person was locked in here.

1986
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,760
Since childhood,

1987
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,880
they were injected with that virus.

1988
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,680
That's so cruel.

1989
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,720
Is there someone among us

1990
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,960
who grew up here since childhood?

1991
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,640
My friend must become a director with a ten-billion box office.

1992
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,600
This is Jin Pengyou's script.

1993
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,200
There's blood everywhere here.

1994
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,200
There's blood on that paper too.

1995
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,720
So the red-haired person from yesterday was Jin Pengyou.

1996
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,200
So I killed my friend.

1997
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,080
I'm the murderer.

1998
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,280
But I have an alibi.

1999
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,680
There shouldn't be secrets between friends.

2000
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,880
So, could there be others like us here?

2001
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,120
Wait, who is this?

2002
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,440
I want to eat a piece of you.

2003
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
No, you can't.

2004
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,280
Neither of you will let me.

2005
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,560
No.

2006
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,640
Then let me fight you.

2007
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,720
I don't believe you can get this male lead.

2008
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,280
He came on a motorcycle.

2009
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,480
So beautiful.

2010
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,280
She amazes me every time.

2011
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,280
I'm going to run away with the "zombie."

2012
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,760
I'll come back another day to challenge you.

2013
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,840
Hello, everyone.

2014
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,960
Tui City's video log.

2015
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,760
There are two more people.

2016
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,600
We can really dance today.

2017
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,800
Peeking with my eyes open.

2018
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,240
I won't say anything, okay?

2019
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,680
You two go out and attract them.

2020
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,640
Then the two of us will go out and catch them.

2021
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,600
You two are in charge of guarding the door.

2022
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:25,920
Okay.

2023
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,080
Are you invisible now?

2024
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,760
I can't see you at all now.
