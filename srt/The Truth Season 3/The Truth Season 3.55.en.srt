1
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,680
What's going on?

2
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,360
Committed suicide.

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,840
There are snake-like marks on his face.

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,800
This person is She.

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,720
If you put it that way,

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
then we are all She.

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,160
You all came back to life, didn't you?

8
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,520
June 1, 2022.

9
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,040
The girl was reborn after accidentally falling from a building.

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,800
Her iris code is She99999.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
No memory of events.

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,720
Those who inhale this smoke gradually lose their memories.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,280
There is only a small chance for those who inhale it

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,120
to recover their memories.

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
It's getting foggy.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,920
What's happening?

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
She is already dead.

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Yeah.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,760
Then why is all this still happening?

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
So it means someone is still switching.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Didn't She die?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,360
Death—only a body died.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,640
He found a new body.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,480
His soul actually left his body.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
That's possible too.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,960
The real She is among us.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,400
Really?

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,520
If it's really as you think,

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
then that's bad.

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
Tomorrow, you'll know

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
your true past and identity.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I think we've all regained our memories.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,560
We remember our memories from each rebirth.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,640
Now we are truly ourselves.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Let's go.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,880
This is City Radio FM0424.

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,360
Latest report from the Meteorological Bureau.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
This week will bring

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
an unprecedented cold wave.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
Please take precautions against the cold.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,470
Entertainment news.

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,960
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,840
is about to begin.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
The entire cast, including He Li, Mo, and Jin Yu, will gather.

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
for a special team-building event lasting a day and a night.

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
Let's look forward to it together.

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
Actually, last night

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,360
something happened.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
Eyes appeared.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes, and we regained our memories.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
We remembered.

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Yes.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
So now you are

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
Dilraba, right?

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm not. I haven't remembered.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,680
Let me tell you,

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
I only remember "Diba".

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,360
I can't recall "Li" and "Re".

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
You're not fully awake, are you?

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,640
Wake up a bit.

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,600
Wake up.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You have nine characters in your name.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
You only remember two.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,080
It's very fragmented.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,840
I remember him. He's called Joker Yu.

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Joker Yu.

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Yes, I'm called Joker.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
He's called Joker.

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Just kidding.

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I remember now.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
Ever since the explosion during the team-building event,

72
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
we've had amnesia.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,680
Did it explode?

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,160
How did it explode?

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,120
Don't panic.

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,200
Do you still remember your mission?

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
I don't remember.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
You were at a team-building event before.

79
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
But actually,

80
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,480
you were doing team-building with a mission.

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,360
Your mission was to find

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,600
an extremely dangerous person

83
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
and capture him.

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
The one with glasses told us the name.

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,640
But

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,840
I can't remember.

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Where we came from, who we are—

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
The one with glasses also said

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
we had to carry out the mission

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,280
and be reborn in several places.

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
That's right.

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
We went to the Sweet Food Factory.

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
The Pirate Mansion,

94
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,160
the Billion Film Company,

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
and now the Earthmoving Village.

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
Because every time we are reborn,

97
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,560
we lose our memory for forty hours.

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,960
We can only remember after forty hours.

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
The memories after the team-building explosion.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,800
So now we can remember what happened before.

101
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,920
But

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,480
we are still

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
in the bodies of these people like Gudefuhe.

104
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,160
What should we do next?

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,280
Yeah.

106
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,920
Our memories from before the team-building explosion

107
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
haven't come back yet.

108
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Right.

109
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,840
We went to the Sweet Food Factory.

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
We found out She was funding Ning Dengpao.

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
In the end, we discovered—he said

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
there's someone else behind Ning Dengpao.

113
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
And took away

114
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,160
all the bodies from the Killing Livestream.

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
Also, at the Pirate Mansion,

116
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
the mysterious person snatched away Ren Weishan's

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,480
forty percent of the ultra-wealthy clients.

118
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,390
Here's a piece of information.

119
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,560
He said, Mr. Ren,

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,120
that mysterious person

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
after buying our list of wealthy clients,

122
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
forty percent of the rich clients

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,240
stopped doing business with us.

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,920
We've investigated through all our channels,

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
but only found out

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,560
that he had contact with someone named Ning Dengpao.

127
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,360
They've been in touch.

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
This mysterious person is She.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,760
Starting at the end of this month,

130
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,160
I'll transport six bodies to you every month.

131
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,840
The contact is Ning Dengpao from Tuitian Food Factory.

132
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
All these bodies were handed over to Tuitaiye.

133
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,640
They were frozen.

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,480
Also, last time at Tui Baiyi Film Company,

135
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
something on an employee's desk

136
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,040
was also taken by him.

137
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,360
Tuitian Food Factory,

138
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,880
the explosion at Pirate Mansion,

139
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
were all his doing.

140
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,000
He also wanted to blow up Tui Baiyi Film Company.

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
There was a bomb on the wall.

142
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,200
This one.

143
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
But we stopped it.

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,120
Great.

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
And yesterday morning,

146
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,240
the Tuitu Village ceremony we attended,

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720
what secret does it hold?

148
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
All of these things

149
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
seem to be related to She.

150
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
Why are we doing this mission

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
is still unknown.

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,200
Why do we keep investigating this She

153
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
Investigating She

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Didn't I kill him?

155
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Then everyone exposed it.

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
And then my voice

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,480
Baojuan, my voice

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,000
was ruined.

159
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,520
It was ruined.

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
My throat burned all the way up to here, right.

161
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,640
We have to keep investigating this person,

162
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,720
but this person is already dead.

163
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,240
Don't you think that's strange?

164
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,840
It's a bit strange.

165
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,760
Or is it possible

166
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,240
that person wasn't actually She?

167
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
She committed suicide.

168
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
She is dead.

169
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,200
Actually, we had doubts about this yesterday.

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
Or maybe there are many Shes.

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,480
That's possible.

172
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
There might be a bigger boss.

173
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes, I just feel that this She

174
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
has his body, but

175
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
the core might not be him.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Because the core can be changed.

177
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes, he probably

178
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
has possessed one of us.

179
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,440
How come as soon as you raise your hand,

180
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,480
it ends up on one of us?

181
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
How come as soon as you raise your hand,

182
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,280
How about that timing?

183
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Eyes.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,800
Here come the eyes.

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
I've got an idea.

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
To confirm whether Mr. She

187
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
is dead or not.

188
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,720
You need to scan Mr. She's iris.

189
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Complete the mission and save the record.

190
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,000
I've prepared an iris scanner for you.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
Take the iris scanner,

192
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,640
and after scanning Mr. She's iris,

193
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,840
the iris printer

194
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
will automatically print out his iris image.

195
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
And generate an iris code.

196
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
A code.

197
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
The iris scanner and iris printer

198
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
are already placed here.

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Look around for them.

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
You're so mischievous.

201
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
You've already put them here.

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Why didn't you put them somewhere more obvious?

203
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,680
Come on.

204
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,680
Right?

205
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,880
There's a cabinet open over there.

206
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Is it in there?

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
That's the main unit of the robot vacuum.

208
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,520
Okay.

209
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
Is it this one?

210
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
Did you find it?

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,600
That iris scanner.

212
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Come here, let me take your temperature.

213
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,520
All done.

214
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,600
Thirty-six, that's fine.

215
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,800
Iris printer is printing.

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
You scanned mine and it printed.

217
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
I scanned yours.

218
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,600
Body is normal.

219
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,360
Identified as Investigator.

220
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You are an Investigator.

221
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,520
Hurry, check everyone one by one.

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,920
There must be someone who's the bad guy.

223
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,840
Right now.

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,480
Okay.

225
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Time to find the culprit.

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,720
Come on.

227
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,640
Come, He.

228
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Come, Ba.

229
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,320
Ke.

230
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,160
Bai.

231
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,760
Ning.

232
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,440
Iris printer is printing.

233
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,920
Alright, that's done.

234
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,800
Okay.

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,720
All are Investigators.

236
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,240
This time, we actually have six Investigators.

237
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,360
All are Investigators.

238
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,720
All six of us are Investigators.

239
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Is there any special information on it?

240
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
JinJing1223

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,520
They're all our birthdays.

242
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
On the back.

243
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Birthdays? Then just remember them.

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Right.

245
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Okay, then let's go.

246
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Let's check hers.

247
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
After we finished yesterday,

248
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,240
we moved him together into the ice cellar.

249
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,400
So let's go to the ice cellar to find him.

250
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay.

251
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,560
Which way do we go?

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Let's go.

253
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,000
Over there.

254
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,040
Alright, let's go.

255
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,520
Confused.

256
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
That's why we can't live in this kind of

257
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
courtyard with so many entrances and exits.

258
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,240
Because we just can't remember.

259
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
Yeah.

260
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
No.

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
Who are you trying to fool?

262
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,160
You little rascal.

263
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,200
Go stick it on your white brother.

264
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
No, you're a brother too.

265
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
So beautiful today.

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,680
How could this be?

267
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,760
Every time I do my own makeup,

268
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,960
I always think I look so pretty.

269
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
But when I see you, I realize

270
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
it was all just wishful thinking.

271
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,280
What?

272
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,320
What kind of body language?

273
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
He has a phone on his chest.

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
It hasn't been turned on since yesterday.

275
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Phone.

276
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Can't turn it on.

277
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,040
Here.

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,080
Okay.

279
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,400
Once we're done scanning, we can go back and check.

280
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,080
Let's go.

281
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,080
Iris printer is printing.

282
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,920
Device battery is low.

283
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,360
Unable to scan.

284
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,120
This device is out of power.

285
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Then let's head back first.

286
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,200
Not a match

287
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
He's not She

288
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,640
If it were She

289
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
he would write

290
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,320
his name

291
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,360
but what's written here is

292
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
abcde

293
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,400
abcde

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Wait a second

295
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,120
So this is the underling

296
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,920
The underling should be

297
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,880
Underling number one

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,240
a

299
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Seems like it, should be

300
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
abcd

301
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Number one

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,400
a b c d

303
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,120
It's possible

304
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,840
Wait

305
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,920
I killed the wrong person

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,280
That's right

307
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,160
And you got caught

308
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,880
No, whether you killed the wrong person or not

309
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,600
you still killed someone

310
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
You're a murderer

311
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
But it doesn't matter who you killed

312
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,600
It's all the same

313
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,280
You're saying this with them

314
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,360
No, I'm trying to comfort you

315
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm saying you should confess and accept your punishment

316
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,120
So this doesn't match

317
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
So She is still alive.

318
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,240
So, yes.

319
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,840
Yes.

320
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,240
Still haven't found him.

321
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Mr. She is so cunning.

322
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Of course he wouldn't die so easily.

323
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
His consciousness escaped.

324
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,680
But his schemes will definitely continue.

325
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
You need to quickly find out where he went.

326
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480
And stop his plans.

327
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,680
No problem.

328
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200
Why do you call him Mr. She?

329
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
That's Miss She.

330
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,640
His name is Mr. She.

331
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,600
He's called Mr. She.

332
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,640
You with a...

333
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Mr. She...

334
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,680
...arguing with a computer.

335
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
Arguing with a pair of eyes.

336
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Your eyes are arguing with me.

338
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
Wait, there's a phone here.

339
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,240
I think its password should be...

340
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
She88888.

341
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Yes.

342
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
S

343
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,280
h

344
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
e

345
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Let's look at the notes first.

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Okay.

347
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,400
Like this.

348
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll read it out.

349
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,560
I was stabbed.

350
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,640
I've already lost too much blood.

351
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,880
This body is definitely going to die.

352
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
Luckily, I can be reborn again.

353
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,840
But the range is limited, and there’s no one nearby.

354
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,760
Before I die, I can only

355
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,840
quickly transfer my consciousness

356
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,320
to the paper figure in the ancestral hall.

357
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
There’s no cell signal.

358
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,360
If you find this among the belongings of this body,

359
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,960
if you find this,

360
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,520
you must come to the ancestral hall to find me.

361
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
Never let anyone take the six paper figures

362
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,480
and burn them in the six meditation rooms at the same time.

363
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
Otherwise, I’ll be permanently trapped.

364
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,640
Meditation room.

365
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
The scary part is coming.

366
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,640
That proves he really isn’t dead.

367
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,080
Right?

368
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
His soul can be reborn again.

369
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
In that paper figure.

370
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,120
So if we want him truly dead,

371
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
we have to burn the paper figure.

372
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,120
Yes.

373
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
I want to say something.

374
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,800
If he has this technique,

375
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,680
then he’s invincible.

376
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,920
He’ll never die in this lifetime.

377
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
Burn it,

378
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,720
and he’ll die, right?

379
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,120
He’s so stupid.

380
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,320
He even wrote it in his notes.

381
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
Who is it?

382
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,720
We're going to burn it now.

383
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
And then let him

384
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
turn to ashes and disappear.

385
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,040
So we're doing it now, right?

386
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Wait a second.

387
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,120
Is this the right order?

388
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,280
But shouldn't we know

389
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,120
what he wants to do

390
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,000
before we burn him in the end?

391
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,160
Doesn't matter.

392
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,840
Let's just do it.

393
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, because you regretted it yesterday.

394
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
Let's go burn the paper figure.

395
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Alright, let's go.

396
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
Is it possible

397
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,880
that when we burn this paper figure,

398
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
it could possess one of us?

399
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,840
I don't think that's possible.

400
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
We'd turn into six of her.

401
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
No.

402
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,400
Just one of us would be possessed.

403
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,000
That's possible.

404
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,000
I really don't want to go in there again.

405
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,880
It's broad daylight, what are you afraid of?

406
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,400
This way.

407
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,600
It's these six.

408
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,280
Six paper figures.

409
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Let's do the makeup.

410
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
Black lips, thin eyebrows.

411
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,160
Okay, it's done.

412
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Like this.

413
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Then each person takes one.

414
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,880
Alright, take one yourself.

415
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,480
Take it yourself.

416
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,240
I remember one has a big mole on the face.

417
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,640
Why are you taking mine again?

418
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Then you hold it.

419
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,120
This is yours.

420
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes.

421
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,560
Big mole.

422
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,800
I don't want this one.

423
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,280
Which one do you want?

424
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,320
I want this one.

425
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,040
Give her this one.

426
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,400
You're even picking color combinations.

427
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,560
Match it with today's outfit.

428
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,120
It's perfect for a runway show.

429
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
Wait, let him design it a bit more.

430
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,200
We'll go out holding this later.

431
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,840
Again.

432
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Let's not design this one.

433
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
It's unlucky, let's go.

434
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,400
It's not really necessary either.

435
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,720
Yeah, it's not really necessary.

436
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,720
But how do we burn them at the same time?

437
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,400
Each person in a separate room.

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,320
I think it might actually be possible.

439
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Possible for what?

440
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,400
While burning the paper figure,

441
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
the paper figure could attach to...

442
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,960
She could possess one of us.

443
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,160
So someone has to act today.

444
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,800
Then we still have to...

445
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,880
Like this.

446
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,160
That's how you get possessed.

447
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
Then it has to be Bai.

448
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,680
He's so good at acting.

449
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,160
Yeah.

450
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm really speechless.

451
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,480
I've been waiting for this day.

452
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,880
Let's go.

453
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,480
Open it.

454
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,520
He's blushing and his neck is red.

455
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,280
Look.

456
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,840
Best Actor.

457
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,040
Best Actor.

458
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,800
Of course.

459
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,560
Right.

460
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Best Actor.

461
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Forget it.

462
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
The Best Actor left us a gift.

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,800
He...

464
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
He left some equipment.

465
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,560
He left it behind.

466
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
His feather.

467
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,960
His most cherished feather.

468
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,920
Give it back to me.

469
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,800
He still cherishes his feathers so much.

470
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,880
Truly worthy of being our Best Actor.

471
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm really speechless.

472
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
It's these six, right?

473
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
The symmetrical one.

474
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,040
Then I'll go to four.

475
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Then I'll go to six.

476
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
I'll go to five.

477
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Then I'll go to two.

478
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm going to three.

479
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,480
Then I'll go to one.

480
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,560
Open the paper figure's chest.

481
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Insert a blessing paper into its heart.

482
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,200
The heart is on the left, right?

483
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,640
Insert a blessing paper.

484
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Put the paper figure in the cabinet and close the door.

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,600
On the cabinet door

486
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,160
Draw on the blank scroll on the cabinet door

487
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
An upside-down "Fu" character

488
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,040
Write "Fu" upside down

489
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
How do you write "Fu" upside down?

490
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,120
Write the "Fu" character

491
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Just write it upside down

492
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,280
Draw the upside-down "Fu"

493
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Alright

494
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Sprinkle some water

495
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
You can start burning the paper figure

496
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,830
Any kind of water is fine, right?

497
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's start burning

498
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,280
It's really burning

499
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,200
wù

500
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,080
rú

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,920
wǔ

502
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
wù

503
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,160
That scared me to death

504
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,480
rú

505
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,160
wǔ

506
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
wù

507
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,040
rú

508
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,880
wǔ

509
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
chüěn

510
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,000
wú

511
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
chüǎn

512
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,000
Who is this?

513
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
chüǎn

514
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,400
There's also "ǎn"

515
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,920
wú

516
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,960
Okay

517
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Go find them

518
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,760
So scary

519
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,000
Who is singing?

520
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,840
Is it ready?

521
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,640
Who is singing?

522
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,760
Me.

523
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,720
You sing really well.

524
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay.

525
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Let's all check together.

526
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Alright.

527
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,320
Here's the situation.

528
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Listen to my version.

529
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,840
It's basically the same as yours.

530
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,720
If it's correct,

531
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,200
we'll pass in one go.

532
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay.

533
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,560
Yes.

534
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Almost.

535
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Yes.

536
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,480
Almost.

537
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Alright.

538
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,160
We're about

539
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,280
99% accurate.

540
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
I think it's 99%.

541
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,880
Yes.

542
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
But do you have this thing in your room?

543
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Phonetic symbols.

544
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
No.

545
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,680
Yes, let me check.

546
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,080
Yes.

547
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,000
Wait a moment.

548
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,080
No.

549
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,440
You tore it off, didn't you?

550
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes.

551
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,440
How did you know to tear this off?

552
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
Because after it got soaked,

553
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
the print appeared after it was soaked.

554
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,240
Is this for decoding a code, or...

555
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,120
How does this...

556
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,400
We didn't tear it.

557
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,480
So we tore it.

558
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,720
Maybe that's part of it too.

559
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
You're so smart.

560
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you sprinkle it like this? You're splashing.

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes.

562
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,560
p u e

563
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,760
Splash.

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
I sprinkled it like this.

565
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,560
I sprinkled it too.

566
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,800
So that's just solving the puzzle directly.

567
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,800
This is about solving the puzzle.

568
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,840
Yes, it's definitely a puzzle.

569
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,960
What I marked is

570
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,120
Is this an English phonetic symbol or a pinyin symbol?

571
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
This is pinyin.

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
b p m f

573
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,760
d t n l

574
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,680
g k h j q x

575
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,080
Yes.

576
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
zh ch sh r

577
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
That's right.

578
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,680
So today we're turning back into She.

579
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,400
Starting to learn human language, right?

580
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,440
ch ü ǎn chüǎn

581
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,120
r uó r uó

582
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,520
This is pinyin.

583
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,120
Yes.

584
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,720
He's afraid of making the questions too hard.

585
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,440
We wouldn't be able to answer them.

586
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
So he just made

587
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,840
kindergarten-level pinyin questions.

588
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,440
Kids, sit nicely.

589
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,360
Come.

590
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,280
I'll report, you guys check.

591
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,400
Okay, what's the first one?

592
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,080
w

593
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,880
w

594
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
What's w u?

595
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
Alright, the first character is yì.

596
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,560
yì

597
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,440
It's ǔ, third tone.

598
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,960
That's right.

599
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,720
yì shí yǐ

600
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,360
Okay.

601
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Alright, next one.

602
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
Is it a or...

603
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,120
an

604
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
There's no an.

605
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
It should be en, right?

606
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,440
So en is correct, right?

607
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
zh u ǎn, zhuǎn

608
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
I think it's en.

609
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,760
Okay.

610
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,720
The last one is w u.

611
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,200
Or is it w u and...

612
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,400
Consciousness has shifted.

613
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,560
Consciousness has shifted.

614
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,280
What?

615
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,800
Consciousness has shifted.

616
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,520
His consciousness has already shifted to...

617
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
...one of us.

618
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,680
There's a big boss now, right?

619
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,600
I told you there would definitely be a big boss today.

620
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,720
Can this be cracked?

621
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,960
Got one at this event.

622
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,600
A mysterious card I can't understand.

623
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,280
Yes.

624
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,320
It can.

625
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,480
Come on, let's solve this.

626
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,680
w u is y.

627
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,040
u is i.

628
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,520
It should be an.

629
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,280
an.

630
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
eng, right?

631
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
ang.

632
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,840
Yes, that's right.

633
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,240
Bomb installed, I think.

634
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
We're going to be blown up.

635
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,320
gueng.

636
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,840
g.

637
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,760
g.

638
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,120
u is i, okay.

639
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,920
eng.

640
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
eng is...

641
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,240
ang.

642
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,080
Third tone.

643
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,960
Okay, next.

644
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,200
The bomb remote is on the second floor of headquarters.

645
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,960
Wait, the four of us are awesome.

646
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,120
And there are two people

647
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
next to us

648
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
flirting

649
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,080
and discussing the case.

650
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,560
No, what is this?

651
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,920
I want to drink, my cold is gone.

652
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,400
No, you can't drink.

653
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,040
My cold is already gone.

654
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,480
Trust me, really.

655
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,120
No.

656
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
So stingy, such a cheapskate.

657
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
The consciousness has already transferred.

658
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,240
What?

659
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,880
After the consciousness transferred,

660
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,200
you immediately stopped helping.

661
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,080
Come here.

662
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,400
What do you mean?

663
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,800
If you think that way, you're really foolish.

664
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,360
Why do you have to think about things like that?

665
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
Seriously, I ought to hit you with a club.

666
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
No, what are you talking about?

667
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,960
No, we're talking about the story's emotions.

668
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,040
"Case" refers to the case itself.

669
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm honestly speechless.

670
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,560
Talk about the plot.

671
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,520
Talk about the case.

672
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,480
Now, among the six of us,

673
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
there is already She.

674
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,560
His consciousness is present.

675
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,880
Yes.

676
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
The consciousness has been transferred.

677
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,920
I think just now,

678
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
these four people have already been ruled out.

679
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,200
Now it's a one-in-two chance for the consciousness.

680
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
No problem, I'm willing to go up against him.

681
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
On the challenge stage.

682
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,560
When we solved this just now,

683
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,800
he was helping the whole time, right?

684
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,160
Yes.

685
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
Then, when we were about to solve that one,

686
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,240
he suddenly circled around.

687
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,040
And then he started with me...

688
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Suddenly, I realized.

689
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,400
When we solved it, the consciousness had already shifted.

690
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,720
He left again.

691
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,760
Wait a second.

692
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,400
It wasn't us who solved it.

693
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,520
You should say it was you guys who solved it.

694
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
You weren't involved in this.

695
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay, after you solved it,

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
he immediately ran off.

697
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,280
He thought I panicked.

698
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
He thought that as soon as I heard "consciousness has shifted,"

699
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,440
I walked over.

700
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,920
I was very nervous.

701
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,800
And then I started to seem like...

702
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,800
What should I do?

703
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Yeah.

704
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,080
I hope everyone

705
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,240
can pay more attention this episode.

706
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,200
She

707
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,680
She

708
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,000
She

709
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
Why did you turn around?

710
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
He called "She."

711
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
Because I knew he was calling me.

712
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,520
I know.

713
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Wait a moment.

714
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,480
You can't.

715
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
You knew he was calling you.

716
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,600
Stop playing like this.

717
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm begging you.

718
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
This can't be cleared up.

719
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Using the answer to work backwards again. Start.

720
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,040
I think this thing

721
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,240
can clear me of suspicion.

722
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,640
Why?

723
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,560
If I were She,

724
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,800
I wouldn't have brought this out.

725
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,440
No, maybe after you did all this,

726
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:04,920
he told you afterward.

727
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,200
No.

728
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Ning, you are She.

729
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,320
If, when that spell was recited just now,

730
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,440
I was She,

731
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,720
think about it, that spell means

732
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,360
my consciousness has already transferred.

733
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
At that point, I would already be She.

734
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,400
But then I couldn't possibly

735
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,160
have brought this over.

736
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,680
So this can prove my innocence.

737
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,520
If we go by seniority,

738
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,840
it seems you really are the eldest.

739
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,800
Big brother, the boss.

740
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,840
You've wanted to be the eldest for years.

741
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,200
If we talk about seniority,

742
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
last time, he was my father.

743
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,200
Do you think that's reasonable?

744
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,840
No.

745
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,800
Actually,

746
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,640
let's get back to ourselves.

747
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,160
Because this time,

748
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
we've gone back to using our real names.

749
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:37,960
Right.

750
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Isn't that so?

751
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,120
You didn't switch back.

752
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,080
You're still using your stage name.

753
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,000
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

754
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
The ultimate mission officially begins.

755
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,480
Among you

756
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,840
someone carries Mr. She's consciousness.

757
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
Consciousness transfer

758
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,360
was determined by the draw you just did.

759
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,240
The color of the paper figure decides it.

760
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,920
Next,

761
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
you need to reconstruct

762
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,480
the story behind She.

763
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,480
And you must find two maps showing the locations of the bomb remote controls.

764
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
to resolve the explosion crisis.

765
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
If the player carrying She's consciousness

766
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
successfully remains hidden

767
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,080
and prevents everyone

768
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,360
from obtaining either of the maps,

769
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,000
the player carrying She's consciousness

770
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,400
can win the golden key.

771
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
If the player carrying She's consciousness

772
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
is completely identified,

773
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,560
or if everyone collects both maps,

774
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,200
then the player carrying She's consciousness fails.

775
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,440
The players not carrying She's consciousness

776
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,640
can win the golden key.

777
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,880
There is still a golden key.

778
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
I'll give everyone a clue.

779
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,200
Okay.

780
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,440
No one here chose the color of the paper figure.

781
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,680
Only she chose the color of the paper figure.

782
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,240
Who chose it?

783
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,760
She did.

784
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,880
I don't want this one.

785
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
I just picked the clothes.

786
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
I picked a female one, I mean.

787
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
Because she just...

788
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,920
Today's outfit.

789
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,680
Didn't we also mention it?

790
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,080
No, I just thought that one looked better.

791
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,120
The others didn't look good.

792
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
There was originally a red one with a mustache.

793
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,160
I thought it didn't look good.

794
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,080
Yeah.

795
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,200
I think it makes sense for her.

796
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,720
It's very reasonable.

797
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,960
Then it's fine.

798
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,960
Puzzle-solving and reasoning tests, all available on Tongcheng.

799
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,520
This is something Tongcheng Travel prepared for everyone.

800
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,080
An evidence-searching assistant tool.

801
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,480
We hope it can help everyone sort out the clues.

802
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,240
Clarify the logic and explore the truth.

803
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
Let's set off with Tongcheng.

804
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Where is the headquarters?

805
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,680
It's the one we went to yesterday.

806
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,640
The office on the second floor.

807
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
Alright, kids.

808
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,960
Let's go!

809
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,720
Okay.

810
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Let's go.

811
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,040
Let's go.

812
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,520
Come on.

813
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,960
Wait a moment.

814
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,640
Entrance.

815
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:39,880
Come.

816
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,400
Let's do it like this first.

817
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,560
Use the umbrella to cover your face a bit.

818
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,720
Then, three, two, one.

819
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,080
As soon as you walk.

820
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,720
Then lift it and your whole face will be revealed.

821
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
Okay.

822
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
Three, two, one, go.

823
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,640
Seriously, really.

824
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,600
Actually, you really like it, don't you?

825
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
He's overjoyed inside.

826
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,680
Secretly pleased.

827
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
He'll go back and watch it over and over.

828
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm speechless.

829
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,440
That's it, we've arrived, right?

830
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,600
Let's go.

831
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,080
Go.

832
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
Why is there no one here?

833
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,600
It's locked.

834
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,880
This door won't open.

835
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
If you want to open the art studio's main door,

836
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,520
you need a secret password.

837
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,800
But since walls have ears,

838
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,480
I can't say it out loud.

839
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,200
But I can act it out.

840
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
I'll show it to one of you.

841
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,080
You two go over and take a look.

842
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,240
Come.

843
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,560
There are seven characters.

844
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,840
Okay, Ning.

845
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,440
Alright, come on.

846
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,080
The password is

847
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,840
Tongcheng Travel Super Saver

848
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,000
Is that right?

849
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,720
That's right.

850
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,680
You guessed it so quickly.

851
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,960
Clearly, you use Tongcheng Travel a lot.

852
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,440
I use Tongcheng Travel often.

853
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
Open the WeChat service

854
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,480
and you can find it right away.

855
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,320
Hotels, homestays,

856
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,160
train tickets, plane tickets—

857
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,200
all sorted in one place.

858
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,840
Super convenient.

859
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,200
Unbeatable low prices can't be hidden.

860
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,880
Let's

861
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,120
set off with Tongcheng.

862
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,080
The password is

863
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
Tongcheng Travel

864
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,960
Super Saver

865
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay, it's open.

866
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Thank you, boss.

867
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Go straight to the second floor.

868
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,920
I'll go check it out later.

869
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,440
Because yesterday

870
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,400
the second floor of headquarters was entered by outsiders,

871
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,520
today the anti-theft mode has been activated.

872
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,240
Anti-theft verification instructions

873
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,920
As long as someone is in the sensor area

874
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
and stays for more than 180 seconds

875
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
the door to the second floor will open

876
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,320
Note

877
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,960
For each verification

878
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,640
if the body completely leaves the sensor area

879
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,360
you cannot return again

880
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,040
If the stay is less than 180 seconds

881
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,400
it will be considered an intrusion

882
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,520
If in the anti-theft area

883
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,880
four intrusion records are detected

884
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,560
the files will be automatically destroyed

885
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,480
in the hidden compartment of the second-floor corridor

886
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,440
Wait a moment

887
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,360
There's something here

888
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,560
There's a card

889
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The boss instructed

890
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
the two explosive remote control location maps must be kept separately

891
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,040
one in the second-floor office file cabinet

892
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,320
the other in the hidden compartment of the second-floor corridor

893
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,040
I'll go for this one first

894
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm a good guy, I have to go first

895
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
Then stick it on me

896
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
What's this, do we have to take off our shoes?

897
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,120
Why is this different from yesterday?

898
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,880
Those socks are for us to wear

899
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,560
Come on

900
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,200
Kids, come put on your socks

901
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Okay

902
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,600
Pick a pair of non-slip socks for yourself

903
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,160
I'll pick first

904
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,760
Let the girls pick first

905
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,400
I want the black ones

906
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,640
You need to take off your shoes.

907
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,680
Then I’ll have to take out my height insoles.

908
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,120
So you’re actually only 1.7 meters tall.

909
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,280
No, 1.4 meters.

910
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,280
1.4 meters.

911
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,720
Actually, the height insoles start from here.

912
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,360
Yes.

913
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,960
That’s really sad.

914
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,440
Alright.

915
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,520
She’s already different after putting on the pants.

916
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,920
Is this the sensor area?

917
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,760
Yes, look.

918
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,840
So we should be here.

919
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,000
Stand for 180 seconds.

920
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,520
That’s what it says up there.

921
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,120
Can’t I just lie down?

922
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Is it possible that

923
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,240
this thing spins?

924
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,520
It does spin, right?

925
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,120
Will it throw people off?

926
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,320
It’s not that dangerous.

927
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
It can’t spin.

928
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,000
Let’s take a look.

929
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
Get up.

930
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,000
What are you doing?

931
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
Do you know you look green lying like that?

932
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,520
People can Photoshop you anywhere.

933
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,200
Food’s spilled.

934
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,080
No, what are we supposed to do now?

935
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Someone has been in the sensor area

936
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,360
for more than 180 seconds.

937
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,640
Then one person should go up first.

938
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,680
Come on, go up and stand.

939
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,480
You go first.

940
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,120
I think your

941
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,520
physical strength and balance are the best.

942
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,240
My balance?

943
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,240
You haven’t seen my dancing, have you?

944
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,200
Six people can only try four times.

945
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
To be honest, I don't really get this.

946
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,880
I don't really get it either.

947
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,320
I think for the first time,

948
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,880
someone has to try and waste one attempt.

949
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,920
Then we plan again.

950
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,160
He, you go.

951
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,520
You go.

952
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,400
Listen to me, you go.

953
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,000
Come on, do it.

954
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,120
If I can't do it, you guys shouldn't either.

955
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,600
Okay.

956
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
If we fail, give us a key.

957
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,600
Alright.

958
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,200
Come on.

959
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,240
Start.

960
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,280
Timing has started.

961
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,280
What are we doing?

962
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,360
What does this mean?

963
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,880
Stand for three minutes.

964
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,120
That's easy.

965
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,760
So far, it's easy.

966
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,710
No idea what we'll have to do next.

967
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,320
No, I think this isn't right.

968
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,670
That's scary.

969
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,520
What does this mean?

970
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,320
No, that's not it, you guys...

971
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,190
We failed once.

972
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,560
That means we have to fight three strong guys.

973
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,720
Wait, let's think back.

974
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,280
Those three people just now...

975
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,240
How do we fight them?

976
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,240
No, it's really not easy to fight them.

977
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,880
Honestly,

978
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,040
it's easy to fight.

979
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,520
You guys go fight.

980
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,400
They won't.

981
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,240
I'll just stay like this.

982
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,120
Don't touch me.

983
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,240
Don't touch me.

984
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,080
Try touching me.

985
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,200
How should I put it...

986
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,680
Once you're up there, you can't come down.

987
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,560
Right.

988
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,920
For example, you have to hold on really tight like this.

989
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,480
Yes, that's right.

990
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Don't let yourself get pulled away.

991
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,320
Okay, let me try first.

992
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,640
Look.

993
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,720
Come on, see if you can...

994
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,160
I can even pull you away.

995
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,720
That person just now was three times stronger than me.

996
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
Hold on tight.

997
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
What you said makes a lot of sense.

998
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll hold on tightly.

999
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,760
You sure are optimistic.

1000
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,720
You're still there—wait a second.

1001
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,680
I think...

1002
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,640
As long as you hold on tight, there shouldn't be any problem.

1003
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,920
No, let's try again.

1004
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,080
If you stick everything on...

1005
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,240
Jin Jing, try pulling me.

1006
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,080
How should I pull?

1007
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,200
Baby.

1008
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Honestly, it's really easy to pull.

1009
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,920
Super easy to pull.

1010
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,120
Baby.

1011
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,240
You don't need to try anymore.

1012
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,200
You're wasting your energy.

1013
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,520
Save your strength, baby.

1014
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,560
I know, let's just

1015
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,880
stack up.

1016
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,680
Just stack your feet together like this.

1017
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,760
Then it locks in place.

1018
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,880
No, those three

1019
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,160
can just move all six of us at once.

1020
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,560
Then let's

1021
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,680
push down hard like this.

1022
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,600
Let's try it simply.

1023
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,040
You four try it first.

1024
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,880
Just lock it in place.

1025
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Come on, lock your legs.

1026
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,760
Come on, lock your hands too.

1027
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,720
Come on, hand lock.

1028
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,160
The two of us will grab you.

1029
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,600
Come on.

1030
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,280
You pull, you pull him.

1031
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,720
Okay.

1032
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,040
The two of us.

1033
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,560
Got it.

1034
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,160
Are you guys ready?

1035
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,520
Ready.

1036
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,040
Okay.

1037
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,480
Ready.

1038
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,800
Okay.

1039
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,720
Walk that way.

1040
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,520
Come on, walk that way.

1041
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,080
Come on.

1042
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,360
Anything else to say?

1043
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,840
Is there anything else to say?

1044
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,520
No, this

1045
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,760
This method doesn't work.

1046
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,320
I found a problem.

1047
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,720
Think of another one, come on.

1048
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,680
Let me see what other ideas you have.

1049
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
Only the feet are non-slip.

1050
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,520
Squat down.

1051
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,600
Please.

1052
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,280
Today we're dressed up as

1053
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Republican-era ladies who studied abroad.

1054
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,200
And now you want me to do this.

1055
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,360
That's right.

1056
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
But now we have to wrestle with people.

1057
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,840
I think that's how it is.

1058
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,240
Let Bai be on top.

1059
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,680
If I'm on top, I'm too slippery.

1060
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,480
No, he won't be able to touch you.

1061
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,000
Because the four of us will

1062
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,360
No.

1063
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
kneel firmly on the ground.

1064
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Beg them.

1065
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,600
Don't drag us away.

1066
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,560
Or we can have more people go up.

1067
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,280
That works too.

1068
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,600
Have one or two stand in the middle.

1069
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,080
Those of us on the outside protect them.

1070
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,760
Protect him.

1071
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,000
Right.

1072
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,560
Okay.

1073
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,120
Protect one.

1074
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,840
Okay.

1075
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,280
Get fired up.

1076
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,800
Come on.

1077
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,560
Come on.

1078
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,360
Come on, let's do it.

1079
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,960
Okay.

1080
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's crouch a little lower.

1081
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,600
Come on.

1082
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,480
We can't lose.

1083
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,160
Hurry.

1084
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,200
He'll be here in just over thirty seconds.

1085
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,560
Wait a second.

1086
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,520
Come on.

1087
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,960
Come on.

1088
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,360
Come.

1089
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Go.

1090
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,680
Go.

1091
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,160
Move away.

1092
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,040
Move away.

1093
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,000
Lock it.

1094
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,360
Lock.

1095
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,480
Ke.

1096
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,160
What are you pushing?

1097
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,960
What are you pushing?

1098
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,120
So what do we do now?

1099
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,000
We only have two chances left.

1100
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,320
Let me see.

1101
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,680
How about this?

1102
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,760
If everyone does this,

1103
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,440
He wants to push backward.

1104
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
Because everyone is hooked together.

1105
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,480
He wants to push backward from that side.

1106
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,960
But the legs on that side are hooked like this too.

1107
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,240
The six of us form a circle.

1108
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,480
Back to back.

1109
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,360
Come.

1110
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,720
That's it.

1111
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,640
Okay.

1112
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,400
I'll trust your method first.

1113
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,440
Let me try.

1114
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,760
Now you guys have hooked up.

1115
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,120
It's hooked.

1116
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,640
I'll just pull your leg.

1117
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
You.

1118
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,240
Two people, okay.

1119
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,800
Come on.

1120
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,400
Impossible.

1121
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,920
That's it.

1122
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
It might work.

1123
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,600
That's it.

1124
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,080
Okay, let's try it.

1125
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,120
If over there in a bit...

1126
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,000
If they all pull that way...

1127
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,760
Then everyone here pulls hard this way.

1128
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,000
Right.

1129
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,720
Shift your weight this way.

1130
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
Yes, that's right.

1131
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,240
Can you two spread out?

1132
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,960
You, just a bit...

1133
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,760
You two have uneven strength.

1134
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
You go that way.

1135
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,320
Right, you come here.

1136
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,880
Okay.

1137
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,760
Ready, three, two, one.

1138
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,280
Come on!

1139
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,840
I don't want to face him like this.

1140
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
So scared.

1141
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,680
Here it comes.

1142
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,920
My heart is still pounding.

1143
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,440
Come on.

1144
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,920
Come.

1145
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,280
Start.

1146
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,360
Come on, do it.

1147
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,920
We are

1148
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,080
He Li and Jin Yu.

1149
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Lock it, make sure it's locked.

1150
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,160
Okay.

1151
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,840
You can do it.

1152
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,440
If it doesn't work, everyone just lie down.

1153
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,080
Lie back.

1154
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
Okay.

1155
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,160
The biceps are flexed.

1156
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,160
Hook your feet.

1157
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,680
They're hooked.

1158
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,840
Here it comes.

1159
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,280
No way.

1160
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,720
No way.

1161
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,320
There's also kicking.

1162
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,520
Lock it.

1163
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,040
Right.

1164
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,320
No way.

1165
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,400
Hands clasped together.

1166
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,800
Hands clasped together.

1167
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,720
Come on.

1168
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,160
No scratching.

1169
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,800
Wait a moment.

1170
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,920
Hold on.

1171
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,960
There's another move.

1172
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,600
Jiawei, hook your foot.

1173
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,240
I'm not ticklish.

1174
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,320
Me too, I'm not ticklish either.

1175
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,520
It's fine.

1176
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,360
I'm not ticklish either.

1177
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,920
Right.

1178
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,960
Bai Yu is ticklish.

1179
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,560
Are you?

1180
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,680
I'm not ticklish at all.

1181
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,320
Tickle me all you want.

1182
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,320
You're pulling me.

1183
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,880
Wait a second.

1184
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,160
No, I don't have any ticklish spots.

1185
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,760
You can tickle me however you want.

1186
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,000
This could work.

1187
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,160
There's someone else.

1188
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,600
Quick, hold me.

1189
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,040
Hold on.

1190
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,440
Got it.

1191
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:01,920
Hold on, got it.

1192
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,280
Don't tickle.

1193
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,480
Don't tickle.

1194
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,800
Wait a second.

1195
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,360
No.

1196
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,080
No.

1197
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,600
Wait a second.

1198
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,640
No.

1199
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,880
No.

1200
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,240
Wait a second.

1201
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,320
No.

1202
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:24,960
Who?

1203
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,000
Who is it? Who?

1204
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,320
It's fine.

1205
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,000
It's okay.

1206
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:35,840
It's all right.

1207
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,040
Step back.

1208
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,240
Jiawei.

1209
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,080
Jiawei.

1210
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,600
It's okay.

1211
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,240
You're pulling.

1212
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,520
It's okay.

1213
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,280
It's okay, alright.

1214
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,760
Alright.

1215
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,520
Okay.

1216
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,760
You're going to choke me, bro.

1217
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,160
Someone's coming again.

1218
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,160
Almost there.

1219
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,240
It's been a minute and a half.

1220
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,680
Keep going!

1221
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,720
It's fine.

1222
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,400
Use your legs.

1223
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,360
No, that's not right.

1224
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,400
Zhang Jiawei.

1225
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,640
Help me!

1226
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,080
Pull him away.

1227
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,920
We can help them.

1228
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,720
Help me.

1229
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,240
Hold him down.

1230
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,360
Hurry, ten seconds left.

1231
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,120
Hurry, ten seconds left.

1232
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,120
Hold on.

1233
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,800
Hold on.

1234
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,360
Pants.

1235
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,040
Pants.

1236
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,280
Pants.

1237
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,640
Four.

1238
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:42,960
Three.

1239
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,760
Hold on.

1240
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,920
Two.

1241
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,120
One.

1242
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,400
One.

1243
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,760
Great!

1244
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,640
We made it.

1245
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,160
Awesome!

1246
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,320
The security system is off.

1247
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,680
My pants!

1248
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,120
My pants are about to be pulled off!

1249
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,720
Are you okay?

1250
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
I'm fine.

1251
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,600
You guys are so ruthless.

1252
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,520
My earring!

1253
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:27,880
Really?

1254
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,840
My hairpin!

1255
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,200
Even my mosquito patch

1256
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,000
got ripped off.

1257
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,480
No way!

1258
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,200
Hold me quickly!

1259
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,480
Don't scratch.

1260
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,480
Absolutely not.

1261
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,240
Go away!

1262
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,360
Go away!

1263
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
That's awesome.

1264
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,680
Awesome.

1265
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,440
Really awesome.

1266
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,680
Alright, the makeup is off.

1267
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,240
Just now, I...

1268
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,680
Whose clothes just now

1269
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,080
wiped off my makeup?

1270
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Look at this!

1271
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,360
It's the mark of his victory.

1272
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,560
I was about to...

1273
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,120
fall off too.

1274
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,720
But

1275
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
when I looked up, I saw there was nothing above me.

1276
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,880
I thought, that's not right.

1277
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,400
If I don't grab on, it's over.

1278
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,640
No, that's not okay.

1279
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,680
Stop them!

1280
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,960
You go stop them!

1281
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,040
Help me

1282
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
Help me, hurry

1283
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,360
We can help them

1284
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,280
Three

1285
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,560
Two

1286
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,720
One

1287
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:45,920
It's done

1288
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,040
I've completed my mission

1289
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,720
That was awesome

1290
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,080
We won

1291
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,080
Awesome

1292
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,640
You're amazing, Zhou Keyu

1293
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,560
Come on

1294
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:01,920
Let's celebrate

1295
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,600
Let's celebrate, everyone

1296
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,920
Come on

1297
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,440
Okay

1298
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,120
He Li, touch Jin Yu

1299
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,680
Next, let's go to the second floor

1300
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,840
Second floor office file cabinet

1301
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,600
The other one is in the second floor hallway

1302
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,640
Is it this paper?

1303
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,920
Okay

1304
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,080
It's open

1305
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,320
In the hidden compartment in the second floor hallway

1306
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,080
Self-destruct device not activated

1307
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,600
Not activated

1308
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,880
I'll look for the hidden compartment first

1309
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,440
Over there

1310
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,400
Map

1311
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,520
Half of the map

1312
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,480
Those two, this is only half

1313
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,000
There are words on it

1314
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,240
Why did someone break in again?

1315
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,960
Catch them

1316
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,240
We just finished a fight, and now more big guys are coming

1317
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,200
It's you guys

1318
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,360
You change your clothes and suddenly I don't recognize you, huh?

1319
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,240
I don't recognize you anymore.

1320
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,200
I know him.

1321
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,000
You.

1322
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,440
Let's go.

1323
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,880
What are you doing?

1324
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,080
Cut the nonsense.

1325
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,720
Move.

1326
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,800
I wasn't talking nonsense. I just said "hey," is that nonsense?

1327
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
Watch your mouth.

1328
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
You make the heiress sound like that.

1329
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,400
Ba is really insisting on being

1330
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,960
the overseas-educated heiress today.

1331
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,720
Her persona is really well-rounded.

1332
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,640
You make the heiress sound like that.

1333
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,280
I have to keep up my persona.

1334
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:09,840
Let's go.

1335
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,360
Move.

1336
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,720
Get in.

1337
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,800
This is that cell.

1338
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,440
Here we go again.

1339
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,160
Detention area.

1340
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,600
Stand in a line.

1341
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,160
Stand over here.

1342
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,280
What's this?

1343
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,320
Come on, take it out.

1344
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,200
What is this?

1345
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,200
Take your stuff out.

1346
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,680
Snake pattern.

1347
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,040
Let go.

1348
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,880
Wait, who's restraining him?

1349
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,280
What are you doing?

1350
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,720
What are you doing?

1351
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,760
Who's restraining him?

1352
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,280
Is he free now? He is now.

1353
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,360
You people...

1354
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,880
Hurry, catch him!

1355
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,560
Quickly!

1356
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,600
Why did someone barge in again?

1357
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,120
Boss.

1358
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,880
Boss.

1359
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,840
Beat him up.

1360
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,880
He was the first one cuffed.

1361
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,120
Cuff him first.

1362
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,280
Cuff him first.

1363
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,080
Isn't that yours?

1364
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,320
That puppy.

1365
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,520
Boss.

1366
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,480
Hurry, beg the boss.

1367
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,320
Looks like I have to

1368
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
lock you all up one by one.

1369
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,640
Boss, cuff him first.

1370
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,680
Boss, don't do this.

1371
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,760
He just ran.

1372
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,400
Alright, you then. Don't move.

1373
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,560
He didn't cuff me.

1374
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,000
What's going on?

1375
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,880
You like this, how could I not cuff you?

1376
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,560
These handcuffs.

1377
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,560
It's my personal hobby.

1378
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,440
I don't have any memory of this.

1379
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,720
I don't remember this.

1380
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,240
Handcuff behind the back

1381
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,560
Cross handcuff

1382
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,400
Real handcuff

1383
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,440
Handcuff all six of us

1384
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,880
Alright, stop arguing and stay put

1385
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,560
Let's go

1386
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,360
Yes

1387
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,440
He dropped something

1388
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,760
Wait, try it

1389
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,280
Step on it, that's right

1390
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:13,640
Right

1391
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,560
It's fine, just step on it first

1392
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,720
What are you doing?

1393
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,200
Nothing, we're just walking

1394
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,200
Don't make noise

1395
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,960
See if the door can close

1396
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,440
Everyone squat down together

1397
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,040
Okay

1398
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,320
Alright, three, two, one, squat

1399
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,080
Don't rush

1400
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,680
The two of us are

1401
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,400
The two of us are back to back

1402
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,760
It's fine, just pick that up first

1403
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,920
Pick it up

1404
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,800
Did you pick it up?

1405
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,320
A little more

1406
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,480
Didn't get it

1407
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,160
Got it

1408
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,960
Got it

1409
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,200
Got it, good

1410
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,640
Alright, got it, stand up

1411
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,480
Three, two, one, stand

1412
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,120
Two, one, up

1413
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,520
Stand

1414
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,120
Okay

1415
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,280
Character

1416
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,400
What

1417
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,200
Verification locker

1418
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,680
Because someone escaped yesterday

1419
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,080
The cell has been upgraded to verification mode

1420
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,120
Open the verification locker

1421
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,640
And complete the verification to open the door

1422
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,520
If verification is not completed within eight minutes

1423
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,560
It will be automatically destroyed

1424
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,080
The files in the filing cabinet in the second-floor office

1425
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,400
The eight-minute countdown has started.

1426
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,640
Hurry.

1427
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,040
Use the yellow one to open it.

1428
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,080
Open it.

1429
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,480
Is it open?

1430
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,320
It's open.

1431
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,720
Okay.

1432
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,920
Please find three tokens in this area.

1433
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,280
And place the tokens in their corresponding spots.

1434
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,360
That will complete the verification.

1435
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,280
On the table.

1436
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:42,960
There are two.

1437
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,360
Let's go.

1438
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,240
Pick up the one on the floor.

1439
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,680
Ba, is it still the one from before?

1440
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,520
Let's crouch.

1441
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,880
Ready, three, two, one, crouch.

1442
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,280
Is that okay?

1443
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

1444
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,640
Yes, got it.

1445
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,720
Three, two, one, up.

1446
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,040
Get up slowly.

1447
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,280
Alright.

1448
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,800
The two of us are just responsible for

1449
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
making sure they take us along.

1450
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,440
Right.

1451
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,120
We're the "muscle."

1452
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,480
There's one more left.

1453
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,720
Check inside the cell.

1454
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,520
Okay.

1455
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,960
Back up.

1456
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,280
It's probably not in the cell.

1457
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,880
Wait a second.

1458
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,320
Who's turning?

1459
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,600
Wait a second.

1460
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,680
Who's turning?

1461
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,240
Wait a second.

1462
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,640
Who's turning?

1463
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,040
Stop turning.

1464
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,360
What are you doing?

1465
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,880
Who's doing what?

1466
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,480
Bai.

1467
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,640
Is it me?

1468
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,680
The two of us are being dragged along by you.

1469
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,640
It's not me.

1470
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,440
You're the one turning, right?

1471
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:48,960
I'm not turning.

1472
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,400
Say something.

1473
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,440
Under this table.

1474
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,320
Should we squat down and take a look?

1475
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,480
Under that table.

1476
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,160
Okay.

1477
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,080
Okay, come on.

1478
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,160
Three, two, one, squat.

1479
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
Squat.

1480
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,880
Okay, now stand up.

1481
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,640
Okay, where else could it be?

1482
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,680
We're running out of time.

1483
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,360
Look, check the ceiling.

1484
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,480
Ceiling.

1485
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,360
Ceiling.

1486
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,800
Even if we see it, we still can't reach it.

1487
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,720
There, in the upper left corner.

1488
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,240
There, it's there.

1489
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,080
This.

1490
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,040
Hurry, we need to step on this.

1491
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,160
Come on.

1492
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,440
I'll do it like this, come on.

1493
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,200
I'm going up.

1494
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,040
Go up slowly.

1495
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,600
Okay, I'm up. Don't move.

1496
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,160
No, that's not working.

1497
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,400
Think of a way, let's think of a way first.

1498
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,320
We need to bring that box over too.

1499
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,920
We need all six of us to go up together.

1500
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,800
Six people go up.

1501
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,240
We can't raise our hands that high.

1502
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,800
The six of us can't get up there.

1503
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,720
Then what should we do?

1504
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:27,880
Like this.

1505
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,800
What kind of posture is that?

1506
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,760
So I can reach farther.

1507
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,760
Try bowing at a ninety-degree angle.

1508
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,600
Right.

1509
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,960
Okay, let's all bow.

1510
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,480
Bow at ninety degrees and raise your hands.

1511
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,040
Raise your hands as high as you can.

1512
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,720
Yes, all of you bow at ninety degrees.

1513
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,560
Okay, I'll go up first.

1514
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,840
Okay.

1515
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,840
Alright, stand up.

1516
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,880
Stand up, don't bow anymore.

1517
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,080
Stand up.

1518
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,560
Okay.

1519
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,320
Hurry up.

1520
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,120
Quick.

1521
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,360
Let me try, move in a bit.

1522
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,920
Move in a bit.

1523
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,000
A little more.

1524
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,520
A little more.

1525
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,640
Quick.

1526
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,880
A little more.

1527
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,640
Let me try.

1528
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,200
Move in a bit.

1529
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,320
Okay.

1530
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:13,880
Okay.

1531
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,080
Take it slow.

1532
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,000
Alright, everyone, let's do the puzzle.

1533
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,720
Guys, check the time.

1534
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,080
Hurry.

1535
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,480
Here, hang it up.

1536
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,200
Come on.

1537
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,600
Hang it here, yes.

1538
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,800
I have two here.

1539
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,400
Here, take this.

1540
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:35,880
Where is it?

1541
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,920
Two.

1542
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,280
Who should take it? Should I?

1543
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,880
No.

1544
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,760
Where is this?

1545
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,560
Turn it clockwise again.

1546
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,160
Clockwise.

1547
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,800
Left side, it's on the left.

1548
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,360
That's not right.

1549
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,240
Clockwise, baby.

1550
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,360
Turn it clockwise.

1551
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,280
On the left, yes.

1552
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:48,960
Yes.

1553
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,360
The last piece.

1554
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,640
One more piece.

1555
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,480
How much time is left?

1556
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:51,840
Time's up.

1557
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,200
Eight minutes are up. Files are being destroyed.

1558
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,160
Really?

1559
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,600
We were cutting it so close.

1560
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,840
We were just a bit short.

1561
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,680
What a pity.

1562
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,560
Wait a second.

1563
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,240
Just now, She was messing things up.

1564
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,680
Who was messing things up?

1565
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,040
Who did you think was messing things up just now?

1566
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,800
Zhang Linghe.

1567
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,720
I had no idea where you all were going the whole time.

1568
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,320
Just follow along, that's fine.

1569
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,680
Forget it, let's think first

1570
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,840
about how to get out of here.

1571
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,480
Come on, let's try again.

1572
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,480
How about I give it a try?

1573
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:26,880
Here.

1574
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,720
Switch sides.

1575
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,320
Ke Yu, your turn.

1576
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,560
Okay, go ahead.

1577
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,120
I'll do it.

1578
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:32,880
Alright, that's good.

1579
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,840
It's open.

1580
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,040
It says "Security System Circuit Breaker" on it.

1581
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,520
Just pull down the breaker.

1582
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,640
Turn it off.

1583
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,120
Security system power.

1584
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,760
Circuit breaker.

1585
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,000
Is it up there?

1586
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,960
Yes.

1587
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,720
It's there.

1588
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,520
Use your foot to turn it on.

1589
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,440
Use your foot to turn it off.

1590
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,040
I can take off my shoes really fast.

1591
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,360
Okay.

1592
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,360
Alright.

1593
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,200
It's turned off.

1594
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,440
The security system is off.

1595
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,320
Let's go check the door.

1596
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,480
Let's go take a look.

1597
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,600
It's open.

1598
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,240
We have to go out this way.

1599
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,760
This is the only way out.

1600
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,800
No, it's too narrow here.

1601
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,320
Squeeze in a bit.

1602
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,440
Snack bag.

1603
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,720
It's fine.

1604
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,600
Okay.

1605
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,960
The key is here, wait a second.

1606
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,840
Alright.

1607
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,640
Like this.

1608
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,440
Hey, let's get this key together.

1609
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,880
Let's come in, finish unlocking it, then leave.

1610
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,320
Where's the key?

1611
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,080
Finish unlocking what?

1612
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:38,480
On the right.

1613
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,120
Do you see it?

1614
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,680
Can you reach it?

1615
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,240
Can you get it now?

1616
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,080
Wait, I have to use my mouth.

1617
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
With your mouth? Okay.

1618
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,440
How do we catch it with our mouths?

1619
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,720
What do you mean?

1620
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:49,760
Okay.

1621
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,520
Go inside.

1622
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,000
No, wait.

1623
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,680
Is your hand okay?

1624
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,640
My hand is fine.

1625
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,040
Don't drop it on the floor.

1626
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,600
Why don't you two just catch it with your mouths?

1627
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,760
Can you catch it with your legs?

1628
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,240
No.

1629
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,640
Let's go in first, let one person unlock it first.

1630
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,440
Isn't that easier?

1631
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:07,680
Right.

1632
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,720
Go in.

1633
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,400
Okay, go in.

1634
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,040
We're back.

1635
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,640
Unlock it first.

1636
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,360
You try.

1637
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,440
I'm unlocking mine.

1638
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,920
You go first, no rush.

1639
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,520
Alright, it's open.

1640
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,480
It's open.

1641
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,080
Awesome, really awesome.

1642
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,960
I'm She.

1643
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,880
You're S(he).

1644
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,720
You're Cow.

1645
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,800
Let us go.

1646
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,600
Friends.

1647
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,560
I'll do it.

1648
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,080
Key

1649
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,440
So our documents have been destroyed.

1650
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,760
What should we do?

1651
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,920
Even with the documents destroyed, we can still find the real culprit.

1652
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,680
He’s already halfway to success.

1653
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,000
No, he has to stay hidden until the end.

1654
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,920
Only then can he get the golden key.

1655
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,240
Let’s go check the destruction.

1656
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:56,920
Right.

1657
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,360
He said the ones in the second-floor office have already been destroyed.

1658
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,400
Let’s see if they’ve really been destroyed.

1659
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,680
Let’s go.

1660
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,040
She

1661
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,440
You miscalculated.

1662
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,160
That’s right.

1663
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,880
You thought you could cause trouble in there just now,

1664
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,760
and I wouldn’t notice?

1665
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,360
Yes.

1666
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,400
Just now, in an unguarded moment,

1667
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,200
you gave yourself away.

1668
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,880
Both Ning and I caught it.

1669
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,840
Are you both talking to me?

1670
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,600
Why do you think we’re talking to you?

1671
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,200
Yeah.

1672
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,880
We were both talking to the front.

1673
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,800
Right.

1674
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,280
Alright, fine.

1675
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,320
Little brother, you can’t be too honest.

1676
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,080
Don’t think you can hide it.

1677
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,880
Why do you look so guilty?

1678
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:31,960
Destroyed.

1679
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:32,640
Destroyed.

1680
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,240
Burned.

1681
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,880
How could we have missed it?

1682
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,520
We were just right.

1683
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,040
Actually, not exactly.

1684
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,160
Were you the one causing trouble?

1685
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Why do you say that?

1686
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,920
Big Brother was the first

1687
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,320
person to climb up to the ceiling to get the paper.

1688
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,960
But before Big Brother climbed up to the ceiling,

1689
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,320
he kept telling us it wouldn't work, that we couldn't get up there.

1690
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,880
He said not to get the box anymore.

1691
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,520
We had to bring that box over too.

1692
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,640
We needed six people to go up together.

1693
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,400
Six people going up.

1694
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,720
But even then, we couldn't reach that high.

1695
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,280
The six of us couldn't get up there.

1696
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,560
This wasn't like usual.

1697
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,920
Normally, he agrees to whatever we say.

1698
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,800
No, what I meant was, I said we couldn't get up there.

1699
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,840
Someone made a suggestion.

1700
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,880
They said six people should go up.

1701
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,600
I said six people couldn't get up there, that's what I meant.

1702
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,120
But later, I was able to go up by myself.

1703
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,960
You're really happy, aren't you?

1704
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,040
I shifted the blame to the eldest brother.

1705
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,680
How can she be so "sly," that person?

1706
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,520
What about hitting the pillar?

1707
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,760
I really like this.

1708
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,000
Friends,

1709
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,840
The map we were looking for in the hallway just now,

1710
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,760
we didn't get a chance to look at it.

1711
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,280
We were taken away.

1712
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,480
On that map,

1713
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,200
one of the remote controls is at the Good Gathering Umbrella Shop.

1714
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,480
There's a line of text on the back.

1715
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Our difficult lives

1716
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,360
are all because of these

1717
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,720
ignorant people nowadays.

1718
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,280
Who are these ignorant people?

1719
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,080
I don't know.

1720
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,600
Because I think we're actually quite...

1721
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,640
I know who it is.

1722
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,920
This is what Big Brother She wrote to you.

1723
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,640
That line about being a loving family.

1724
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,960
It refers to humans.

1725
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,160
There were still several places we didn't open yesterday.

1726
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,560
Why don't we try again?

1727
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,760
Here's another one.

1728
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,560
Our highest goal to accomplish

1729
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,480
This is a password.

1730
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,760
There's another password here.

1731
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,200
There should be some

1732
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,040
more clues about the Snake Clan.

1733
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:16,920
Let's look for them first. Come on.

1734
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,480
That one.

1735
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,240
It hasn't been opened, right.

1736
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,400
And that one.

1737
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,640
Is there a key? Find me a key.

1738
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,400
Wait, there's a bomb remote control in here.

1739
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,360
Seriously?

1740
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,600
It seems like the countdown will start as soon as we open it.

1741
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,160
So we should open this one last.

1742
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,480
Let's see, then.

1743
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,400
What else is here?

1744
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,720
Detailed database.

1745
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,280
We searched this one yesterday.

1746
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,960
But...

1747
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,840
All of these are useful.

1748
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,360
Right, this one might have something.

1749
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,280
Yeah, let's do it.

1750
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,400
How about we open this one first?

1751
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,280
I just won't listen to you.

1752
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,920
I want to open that.

1753
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,280
Alright, that's fine.

1754
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,800
Okay.

1755
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:06,840
This one is short.

1756
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,120
Okay.

1757
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,600
Come on.

1758
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,280
What is "b"?

1759
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,720
"b" is...

1760
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:11,920
e.

1761
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,760
"e" is...

1762
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,120
wo.

1763
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,720
Me.

1764
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,000
f.

1765
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,440
m.

1766
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,360
"i" is "e".

1767
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,240
What about "n"?

1768
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,240
t.

1769
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,280
met.

1770
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,760
What is MBTI?

1771
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,400
Is there "in"?

1772
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,320
There is "in", right?

1773
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,600
There's "en".

1774
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,360
en.

1775
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,400
"g" is "l".

1776
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:31,800
l.

1777
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,000
"ei" is "ai".

1778
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,560
"c" is "z".

1779
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,680
What about "z u"?

1780
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,520
ui.

1781
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,040
We come from

1782
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,640
No.

1783
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,080
You can only enter eight characters.

1784
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,400
Where do we come from?

1785
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,080
We come from...

1786
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,840
What was the name of the camping place?

1787
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,120
Aren't we from the camping place?

1788
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:55,680
No.

1789
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,120
You need to know,

1790
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,840
This is first and foremost She's office.

1791
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,080
The things in his office

1792
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,480
must have been set up by him.

1793
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,520
Right.

1794
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,840
Just think from She's perspective.

1795
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,320
We come from...

1796
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,960
a dark and damp cave.

1797
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,120
Dark...

1798
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,640
What "xia" (down/under) something?

1799
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,320
Sewer.

1800
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,640
You're crazy, you know.

1801
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,040
Did you try "underground"?

1802
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,560
We come from underground.

1803
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,400
We're into rap.

1804
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,360
We come from underground.

1805
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Underground.

1806
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,560
We come from...

1807
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,600
We come from the mist.

1808
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,960
Woke up in the mist.

1809
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:36,920
You try it first.

1810
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,320
That's not right.

1811
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,240
We come from Tui City.

1812
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,560
Try "Tui City".

1813
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:48,960
No.

1814
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,640
We come from "Start Reasoning".

1815
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,320
We come from "Start Reasoning".

1816
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,360
Three.

1817
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,560
None of them are right.

1818
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,040
If we look at the map again,

1819
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,560
Our difficult lives

1820
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,760
are all because of these

1821
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,760
ignorant people nowadays.

1822
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,960
Let me take a look.

1823
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,680
The logic should be like this.

1824
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,160
Our difficult lives are all now

1825
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,040
caused by these ignorant people.

1826
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:21,920
He might be saying

1827
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,880
the past,

1828
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,080
we come from the past,

1829
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,560
it's possible.

1830
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,920
The past.

1831
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,320
That's not right.

1832
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,720
Once.

1833
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,720
A comparison with the present.

1834
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,080
What if we come from the future?

1835
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,480
We come from the future.

1836
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,440
For example, if I'm a person from the future,

1837
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,480
I'm living a hard life now

1838
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,160
because these people didn't work hard before

1839
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,920
and destroyed the environment.

1840
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,040
It's possible.

1841
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,000
Right.

1842
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:56,960
Wrong.

1843
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,760
The Snake Clan's code

1844
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,320
Do we need to

1845
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,280
use the Snake Clan's pinyin

1846
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,400
I got it, that's how it works

1847
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,280
If it's for the future, switch it back later

1848
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,040
What letter is it

1849
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,840
Switch it back to snake language

1850
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,360
future

1851
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,240
w

1852
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,360
Look at the black w

1853
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,680
w is b, note the first b

1854
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,520
ei is ui

1855
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,000
l is g

1856
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,080
ai is

1857
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,560
ei

1858
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,360
bui gei

1859
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,640
We are from bui gei

1860
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,880
bui gei

1861
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,080
Open

1862
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,840
Correct

1863
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,280
You're amazing

1864
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,240
Real-time monitoring

1865
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,080
Real-time monitoring

1866
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,680
We are now in the same space and time

1867
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,520
As on the first day

1868
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,040
Yes

1869
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,350
We are not in the same space and time

1870
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,120
We are in the future

1871
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,720
Yes

1872
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,880
It's the same space and time

1873
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,430
Right now, it's real-time

1874
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,720
So this is May 10th

1875
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,390
Then why do we exist at the same time?

1876
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,240
No

1877
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,350
I'm not using Liu Yuning's body

1878
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,080
I'm using Mo Ning's

1879
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,760
Right

1880
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,040
Good Mo Ning

1881
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,040
Then this person

1882
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,160
Whose consciousness is he working with there?

1883
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,720
He doesn't

1884
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,470
He

1885
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,270
It's impossible for consciousness

1886
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,920
to exist in two people at the same time

1887
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,800
So we are from the future

1888
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,240
We could be

1889
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,920
people who traveled back to May 10th

1890
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,040
To them at that time,

1891
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,920
we are the future.

1892
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,760
If you use their timeline as a reference,

1893
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,840
they are the present, and we are the future.

1894
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,920
Right, we are in their future.

1895
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,310
So it's our present now.

1896
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:53,840
will be living (a hard life).

1897
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,120
It's all these people now.

1898
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,200
These people are ignorant.

1899
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,270
Why are we there?

1900
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,800
Not only ignorant, but also foolish.

1901
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,390
What did we do?

1902
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,800
I want to ask, what did we do?

1903
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,000
It's not us, it's them.

1904
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,160
I want to ask,

1905
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,600
how do these people look foolish?

1906
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,430
Look at this.

1907
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,760
Why can't I crush it?

1908
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,560
Use more force.

1909
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,360
There is a bit of that.

1910
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,040
I agree too.

1911
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,000
There's a possibility it's like this.

1912
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,080
We're monitoring in real time now.

1913
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,240
That means our past selves in that timeline

1914
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,640
haven't been blown up yet.

1915
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,240
So our goal

1916
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,360
should be to save those people.

1917
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,880
Because after finishing with the balloons,

1918
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,000
they immediately went to buy groceries,

1919
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,840
then cooked,

1920
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,640
after making dinner, they were about to go fishing,

1921
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,520
ate,

1922
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,440
and after eating, the explosion happened.

1923
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,600
Right, this explosion was

1924
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,840
caused by She.

1925
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,880
Yes, we've experienced

1926
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:52,960
them being blown up.

1927
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,840
We're considered the future.

1928
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,960
So now, the six of us

1929
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,280
all have to save our past selves.

1930
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,600
But one person doesn't want to save themselves.

1931
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,120
Because he's already possessed by She.

1932
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,320
There's one of those.

1933
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,160
What is it?

1934
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,560
A screen remote, voice-controlled.

1935
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,680
Try using voice control.

1936
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,000
Next page.

1937
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:19,880
Wait a moment.

1938
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,560
The little characters below are so cute.

1939
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,000
Yeah.

1940
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,720

Second, Bai Yu, read it yourself.

1950
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,200
Okay.

1951
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,080
Stop speaking in riddles.

If lined up, they could circle the earth over 300 times

1958
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:05,560
It's over

1959
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,200
Why am I wearing a grass skirt?

1960
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:08,960

I can produce photos too

1983
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,280
X-rays count as photos too

1984
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,080
Okay

1985
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,160

Why is yours so good?

1992
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,400
Wait a second

1993
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,440
You're ten years younger than me

1994
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,080
That's right

1995
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,400
Bai Yu

1996
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,840
The two of us are twelve years older than Zhou Keyu

1997
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,560
We are twelve years older than you

1998
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,680
What does twelve years mean?

1999
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,040
A whole cycle

2000
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,160
A full cycle

2001
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,360
A full cycle

2002
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,200
That was my first reaction too, bro

2003
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,960
We're really exactly the same

2004
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,160
Can you guys be a bit more mature?

2005
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:27,600
Just

2006
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,800
Twelve years

2007
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,480
I can't believe we're twelve years older than him

2008
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,280
You very likely

2009
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,240
I thought it was just seven or eight years

2010
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,480
When you could use a computer

2011
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,760
He was still drinking milk

2012
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,440
Bro, I've always felt

2013
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,200
he's about the same age as us.

2014
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,640
If you're childish, that's your own business.

2015
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,480
Don't drag me into it.

2016
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,880
Starting today,

2017
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,600
there's a generation gap between us.

2018
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,000
No,

2019
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,040
no, that's not it.

2020
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,600
No, you don't have to think that way.

2021
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,080
I suddenly feel a bit guilty.

2022
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,360
Guilty about what?

2023
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,040
Now that it's ending,

2024
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,040
I realize I didn't really look out for him this season.

2025
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,080
It's okay.

2026
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,560
He already relied on his own abilities

2027
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,040
and got first place with the golden key.

2028
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,240
That's right.

2029
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:07,960
Yeah.

2030
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,640
Talented at a young age.

2031
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,160
I feel guilty too.

2032
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,600
Me too.

2033
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,360
How did we let him

2034
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,560
get so many golden keys this season?

2035
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,800
We could live to be over a hundred, right?

2036
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,840
No changes for a hundred years.

2037
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,280
Alright.

2038
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,200
Okay, turn the page.

2039
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,640
Turn the page.

2040
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,840
A useless thing

2041
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,280
I need to arrange for someone to go to the farm in advance

2042
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,200
to install surveillance

2043
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,160
After the six investigators are reborn

2044
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,720
I will go and plant bombs

2045
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,040
and blow them all up

2046
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,000
To be safe

2047
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,280
I will also use something that can directly affect their genes

2048
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,320
the amnesia gas, the memory-erasing bomb

2049
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,000
In case they aren't killed by the explosion

2050
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,800
or if they are reborn again

2051
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,040
they will forget everything

2052
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,800
and won't be able to stop me

2053
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,680
This is from the Special Immigration Bureau

2054
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,920
AI assistant TYJ

2055
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,760
A useless thing

2056
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,760
The Special Immigration Bureau's plan

2057
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,960
won't work

2058
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,960
What does that mean?

2059
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,880
He's talking about arranging for someone to go in advance

2060
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,360
to the farm to install surveillance

2061
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,520
The scene we just saw

2062
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,400
was from the surveillance that was installed

2063
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,800
Then he planted bombs to blow us up

2064
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,960
And there's also this memory-erasing bomb

2065
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,000
It makes us

2066
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,480
lose our memory every time we travel to a new place

2067
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,080
so we can't stop him

2068
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,360
These two eyes

2069
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,080
are from the Special Immigration Bureau

2070
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:26,560
AI assistant

2071
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,360
It's here to help us

2072
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:27,640
Right

2073
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,120
It's the Special Immigration Bureau's AI assistant

2074
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,080
It's just an AI

2075
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,240
A useless thing

2076
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:31,280
It won't work

2077
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,240
This means that right now we don't know

2078
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,880
what the Special Immigration Bureau's plan is

2079
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,680
It must be the Special Immigration Bureau.

2080
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,760
They sent us here.

2081
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,600
To accomplish a certain task.

2082
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,000
This task

2083
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,680
might pose a threat to She.

2084
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,280
That's right, that's the logic.

2085
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,400
But She already knows.

2086
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,160
She said

2087
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,760
I also want to go back to 2025.

2088
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,600
To stop the Special Immigration Bureau's plan.

2089
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,200
So basically,

2090
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,480
the current She is from the future.

2091
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,440
Yes.

2092
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,400
If we go by that killer,

2093
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,760
before this plan is completed,

2094
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,720
we go through this series of developments

2095
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,640
and become

2096
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,280
officers of the Bureau.

2097
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,040
Right.

2098
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,600
You're already on the path to an official career.

2099
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,520
These are the six investigators recruited by the Bureau.

2100
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,240
So how does the Immigration Bureau handle migration?

2101
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,680
Where do they move people, and how?

2102
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,720
No one has thought about this.

2103
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,280
You haven't figured it out, have you?

2104
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,480
What is the purpose of the Immigration Bureau?

2105
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,440
But we still don't know.

2106
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,080
Alright, let's turn the page.

2107
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,720
Please use voice input to view the password.

2108
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,760
The Special Immigration Bureau's plan.

2109
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,160
Migration—where are we supposed to go?

2110
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,920
So they're coming

2111
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,120
to take away the people of today.

2112
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,240
A human eradication plan.

2113
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,800
No, that's not it.

2114
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,640
I got it.

2115
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,280
A Serpent Clan eradication plan.

2116
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,760
What is the Special Relocation Bureau's plan?

2117
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,160
That would make the Snake Clan want to

2118
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,600
kill the Special Relocation Bureau's investigator.

2119
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,360
Then it must be a plan targeting the Snake Clan.

2120
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,240
Operation Purge Snake.

2121
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,080
Purge Snake.

2122
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,040
Operation Purge Snake.

2123
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,240
This is that

2124
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,000
She’s

2125
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:11,960
resurrection.

2126
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,080
Here's what happened, look.

2127
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,880
Yesterday, an eight-year-old girl

2128
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,520
was playing on the balcony

2129
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,120
and accidentally fell.

2130
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:19,800
When the ambulance arrived,

2131
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,920
the girl had already stopped breathing.

2132
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,400
Suddenly, a thick fog appeared.

2133
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,840
Amazingly, the girl came back to life.

2134
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,920
And it says here

2135
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,160
that it was a miraculous recovery that medicine can't explain.

2136
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,160
There's one possible explanation.

2137
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,240
For example, someone who died here

2138
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,560
could be used by someone from the future

2139
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,280
to return through the body of the deceased here.

2140
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
A person from the future

2141
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,040
is reborn into a corpse in the present.

2142
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,880
This sandbox

2143
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,640
This building

2144
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,280
is called "We Will Meet Again"

2145
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,680
On the ruins of your soul

2146
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,600
I will build a whole new world

2147
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,520
He wants to save his daughter

2148
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,800
His daughter probably can't be saved

2149
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,000
What world am I changing

2150
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,400
Human greed can't be changed

2151
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,000
Angry

2152
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,560
I want revenge

2153
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,000
Push the city to collect and create more vessels

2154
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,680
Find a girl to replace his own daughter

2155
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,880
Then who is he going to send her to

2156
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,600
Faint Island

2157
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,080
That child who was exchanged

2158
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,320
It's all connected

2159
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,880
Early preparations

2160
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,160
Invest in Ning Lightbulb in advance

2161
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:12,800
Pirate Mansion

2162
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,520
Ren Weishan seems to be investigating me

2163
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,720
If there's a risk of exposure

2164
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,280
Find an opportunity

2165
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,040
Destroy the evidence

2166
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,560
I've met him

2167
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,600
Director of Push Billion

2168
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,360
He's Push Taiye

2169
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,160
All three of them were revived by She

2170
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,600
The Snake Clan wants to replace the entire world

2171
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,360
That's really scary

2172
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,960
If we want to deactivate this bomb

2173
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,360
We need to guess who She is right now

2174
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,360
That's a bit difficult

2175
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,800
Should we just take the risk?

2176
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,680
No

2177
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,080
Wait, I don't want to

2178
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:39,960
I think we should wait

2179
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,880
How about the three of us try?

2180
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,920
I think you seem like a good person

2181
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,920
Hurry up and go

2182
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,560
The three of us

2183
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,240
Let's just go with our first instinct

2184
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:45,840
Go

2185
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,520
I really can't let you lead me anymore

2186
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,120
I'm a good person

2187
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,000
You don't seem like a good person

2188
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,720
Listen to me

2189
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,800
You really don't seem like a good person

2190
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,560
Stop arguing

2191
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,120
Guys, vote, vote, vote

2192
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,360
Minority obeys the majority now

2193
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,280
Hurry up

2194
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,680
It's going to explode
