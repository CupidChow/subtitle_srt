1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,200
Welcome

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
This time, Dilraba gave me a task

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,120
Do you know what it is?

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,000
To protect you

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,360
And take care of you

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
She's really nice

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,760
Really, she's great

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,360
We just need to wake him up

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,280
He'll do mouth-to-mouth on his own

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,720
Yes, that's right

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,360
The brothers didn't hang out together for nothing

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,120
You should just go for her

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,320
Just pretend to go for it

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,600
But don't wake me up

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,760
Son

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,400
Three, two, one, go

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Who are you?

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,720
This is a line we say together

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,840
Wake me up first

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
I think we need to rehearse this scene

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,920
I used to play with sticks

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Monkey staff, specifically

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,080
So you're a monkey trainer?

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Like me, crazy in love

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
How does that song go?

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,520
There's a singer in the back

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Can't you ask him?

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,520
What?

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,760
When you turn around, what about the singer?

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
If the moon hasn't come yet

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,599
Can you take that thing off your lips?

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,720
Girls designed all this on purpose

33
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,640
And then like this, like this

34
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
This is Old Master Gu De.

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,160
Hello, Old Master.

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
Butler Ke.

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Gu De La Ke.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
That's me.

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,880
Hello.

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,960
Hello.

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,400
This door is stuck.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Hello.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,560
Hello.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,760
This is the Old Master.

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,200
Okay.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Little assassin.

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,080
Servant.

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
You have a cold, I should keep my distance.

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Do you think you can escape today?

51
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,160
The two of us.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,320
What's the point of you staying away from me for a bit?

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,800
You're toxic.

54
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,640
You're toxic.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
You're toxic.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
He's really funny (the director).

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,479
He said, do you still remember

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,040
what we have to do every day?

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
We have to spy on him, right?

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
I said yes, spy on him.

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,800
Right side.

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
So scary.

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
I don't want to record anymore, I want to go back to Beijing.

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Don't mess with this, stop it.

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
Yueyue

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,880
Hello, little darling.

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,280
Hello.

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
I was so scared when I came in.

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,600
It was really scary.

70
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,520
It was really scary.

71
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
I asked if you were scared.

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,440
I was really scared.

73
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
This time, the task Dilraba gave me

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Do you know what it is?

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
is to protect you and take care of you.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
She's really nice.

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,760
Really, she's great.

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,240
But I said,

79
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,520
I can't even protect myself.

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm afraid I might accidentally hurt you.

81
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
It's not that scary, is it?

82
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm full of positive energy.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
Are you the killer today?

84
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,840
No.

85
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,840
Something's off about you.

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't be like this right from the start.

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Something's off about you.

88
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,360
You really are acting strange.

89
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
I give up.

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,000
You really are acting strange.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm really not.

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,920
No, that's not right.

93
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,080
Stop stress-testing me here.

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,480
But I'm your X, don't be afraid.

95
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
It's nice to have an apple in the morning.

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,960
Eat it now.

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,680
Let's see if I have the strength for this.

98
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Wait, I have a wet wipe.

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
It's fine, doesn't matter.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Looks like I can't break this open.

101
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
With our strength,

102
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,600
Broken, can't be pried open.

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Do you remember the names of the others?

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,440
Who could remember these names?

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
It's already good if you can remember the relationships.

106
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,680
The Good family?

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Good.

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
What's the father's name?

109
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
It's Good Morning.

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
What's the butler's name?

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,840
It's Good Luck.

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
What's the eldest sister-in-law's name?

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
It's...

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,600
A Jin.

115
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,520
Jin what?

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,520
What's her full name, Jin what?

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Think quickly.

118
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,480
I can't remember.

119
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
She made a lotus root elephant.

120
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
Jin Lotus Root.

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
Jin Hook Breaks Lotus Root.

122
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,840
Jingle Bells.

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,240
Right.

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,840
What's the mother's name?

125
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
What's the mother's name?

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,520
How would I know the mother's name?

127
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
Above the Moon.

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
How could anyone remember that?

129
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,600
I can remember.

130
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,440
I can't remember.

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
Butler.

132
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
What was your name again?

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,440
Good Luck.

134
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,120
Good Luck.

135
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,040
Today is your favorite script.

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes.

137
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
And I think with the young master,

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,480
there's something between us too.

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
I really like this kind of story.

140
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
The role I want to play the most is

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
the one from "Story of Yanxi Palace,"

142
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,840
Yes, Erqing.

143
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,960
She married that guy...

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,160
Why did I forget everything?

145
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
Fuheng.

146
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
And then with his younger brother...

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
Have they all finished their scenes?

148
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,200
Let's just follow this process.

149
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,160
Hurry and call Zhang Linghe over.

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
I need to rehearse with him.

151
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
He'll be here soon.

152
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
We still need to rehearse?

153
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Of course.

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,400
And don't you think

155
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
their arrangement is really unreasonable?

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
He and I are a married couple,

157
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,400
but I wake up here,

158
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
and he wakes up over there.

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
But I also thought just now

160
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,520
the two of you would be leaning together here.

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Yeah.

162
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Then later, tell him to change the scene.

163
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
What do you think?

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
I’ll say it.

165
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,160
If I change it, I feel embarrassed.

166
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,920
Okay, I’ll ask him for you.

167
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,840
But I might say something like...

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
Why would you think that?

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
But you have to stick to it, okay?

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,280
For my sake.

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,160
Just get mad at me.

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
Say, "Jin Jing, be more professional."

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Alright.

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,320
Is that okay?

176
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,080
Work with me on this scene.

177
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Okay.

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,280
Hello.

179
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
Welcome.

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,360
Master

181
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
You know what your role is, right?

182
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes.

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Okay.

184
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
Hello, teacher.

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,360
Hello.

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Hello.

187
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
Husband.

188
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
Husband.

189
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Husband.

190
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
I know.

191
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,040
It's stuck.

192
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,240
That's not right.

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,480
Do you two know what the opening act is for?

194
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,200
I know.

195
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
We wake up from here.

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
The two of us get married.

197
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Yes.

198
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
So it should mean

199
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,480
You two need to lie down together.

200
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,200
The two of us lie down together?

201
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,960
Isn't that inappropriate?

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,640
She needs to lean against you.

203
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,480
You two are a married couple.

204
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,200
Isn't this inappropriate?

205
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

206
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,880
I don't think that's okay.

207
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
It's fine.

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
You need to hold each other tightly.

209
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,880
Where is this place?

210
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,640
Who are you?

211
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,920
Who are we?

212
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
This line must be exactly the same.

213
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
You can improvise the rest.

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,560
We have to do it this way.

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
After waking up,

216
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,200
Where is this place?

217
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
Who are you?

218
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,040
Who are we?

219
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
You must act out this tone.

220
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
Come on, let's run through the scene.

221
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,480
Hurry.

222
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Come on.

223
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Act well.

224
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm telling you, this is for film and TV.

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
Do your best.

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,160
Three, two, one.

227
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
Hurry up.

228
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,080
Three, two, one, go.

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,320
Come on.

230
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Three, two, one.

231
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,520
Where is this place?

232
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
Who are you?

233
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Who are we?

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,480
That's right, you must hold each other tightly.

235
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Move the one in the middle.

236
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,240
Why?

237
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,800
Take the table away.

238
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,720
Yeah, I think it's in the way.

239
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
I thought it was in the way from the start.

240
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
And why don't the two of them

241
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
wake up together?

242
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,080
Shouldn't she be lying on top of him?

243
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,880
Then he fell asleep holding her like this.

244
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
You don't have a fever today.

245
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
You were out of it from the fever yesterday, right?

246
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Ke Yu.

247
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,200
Come on.

248
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,200
I think we should wake up one by one like this.

249
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,760
He wakes up first.

250
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Then I'll have him give you mouth-to-mouth.

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
Okay.

252
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,680
Today, your roles

253
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
should be switched.

254
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
What's going on?

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
Contrast.

256
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Look.

257
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,760
You.

258
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,520
I have to call her "Mom."

259
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,320
Stop thinking about other women.

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
You can only have me in your heart now.

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,880
You can only have me in your heart now.

262
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Do you have this?

263
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,920
I don't.

264
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
The one I love isn't you.

265
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
Really.

266
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,640
I'm not recording anymore.

267
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,000
Today, you're the one with unrequited love.

268
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay.

269
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
About to faint.

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,520
Faint.

271
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,400
Where is this?

272
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Who are you?

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,840
Who are we?

274
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay.

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,240
Then hold my face and say,

276
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
So beautiful, so familiar.

277
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,360
The butler has to give mouth-to-mouth.

278
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Why should I give her mouth-to-mouth?

279
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Right.

280
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,520
Why should I do it?

281
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
You have to save her.

282
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,080
They're a married couple.

283
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
Young master, you like me too.

284
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,440
How did he end up sleeping like this?

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Wait a second.

286
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,160
This scene is a bit hard to act.

287
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,440
Let me go first.

288
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
Let me laugh first, hold on.

289
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,040
When I'm filming like this,

290
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,800
I really can't handle these kinds of scenes.

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
Pretending to be sick or dead, that sort of thing.

292
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
Because when someone is lying there like that next to me,

293
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
I just want to laugh.

294
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,320
Butler.

295
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,280
You need to keep an eye on him.

296
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,720
Don't let him get close to my sister-in-law.

297
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
You go over there.

298
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,240
I want to be closer to my sister-in-law.

299
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,960
That's not what I meant.

300
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,520
We don't need to.

301
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,080
We just need to wake him up.

302
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,680
He'll do mouth-to-mouth on his own.

303
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Yeah, that's right.

304
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Wake him up.

305
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,120
Brothers, our friendship wasn't for nothing.

306
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
It wasn't for nothing being with you guys.

307
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
Stop talking nonsense.

308
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,400
Come on.

309
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
You go deal with her.

310
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes, you handle her.

311
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't mess with me.

312
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,720
Be gentle.

313
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,480
Nobody do anything.

314
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
No, just pretend to do it.

315
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
But don't wake me up.

316
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
Daughter-in-law, wake up.

317
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,360
Son.

318
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,920
Both sides.

319
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,000
What do you mean by both sides?

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Add two more over there.

321
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,400
Give me some camera time, guys.

322
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
You two handle him.

323
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
Just stand here.

324
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,720
Okay.

325
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,760
Don't touch me.

326
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,880
It's fine, we won't.

327
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,960
Don't worry, just close your eyes.

328
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
You two just do it.

329
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,200
Right.

330
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Squeeze his chest like crazy.

331
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Go.

332
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Three, two, one, start.

333
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,720
Young master.

334
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,400
Daughter-in-law.

335
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Young master.

336
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,520
Young master.

337
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,040
Harder.

338
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,760
Young master.

339
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,080
Young master.

340
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Ignore her for now.

341
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,160
Brother

342
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
The young master is awake.

343
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
You're awake, son.

344
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,800
Where is this?

345
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,600
Who are you?

346
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
This is the line we say together.

347
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,640
You wake me up first.

348
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,760
No, wait a second.

349
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,320
Seriously, shouldn't you look for your wife first after waking up?

350
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,880
I think we need to rehearse this scene.

351
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,560
And why is that?

352
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,040
After he wakes up,

353
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,720
he'll definitely want to

354
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
instinctively ask who I am, right?

355
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,320
He's acting it correctly.

356
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't recognize anyone.

357
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Why would I wake you up?

358
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes.

359
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,560
No.

360
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
Deep in your memory,

361
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,920
you still recognize her.

362
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,200
Wake up together.

363
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,600
No.

364
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,520
Forget it, let's just wake up together.

365
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,960
Let's skip the kissing scene too.

366
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll add a bit for you later.

367
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,640
Add a bit later.

368
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,680
I want it.

369
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I think you still need to

370
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
recognize the woman you love.

371
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,000
It's fine.

372
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,160
I'll design a part for you.

373
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,840
Don't worry, I'll design it for you in a bit.

374
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,560
You're designing it for me?

375
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
Wake up together.

376
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,280
Wake up together.

377
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,200
Okay.

378
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
Three, two, one, action.

379
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
Are there any songs that are scary?

380
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,440
A Chinese-style one, the two of us will sing.

381
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
Because the two of us don't need to join this round.

382
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,520
Um...

383
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Let me tell you,

384
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,840
No.

385
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,880
Pick another one.

386
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
Change to a children's song, right?

387
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
Yeah, children's songs are the scariest.

388
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,040
Children's songs work too.

389
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Children's songs are fine.

390
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,520
Children's song.

391
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Just sing it directly.

392
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,400
Just sing "Only Mother is Good in the World."

393
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
Let's try that theme song.

394
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's still keep a bit of that Chinese horror vibe.

395
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,400
Right.

396
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
You hum one.

397
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,560
Let me think.

398
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
How about singing "Mercury Records"?

399
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,840
It's really scary.

400
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,400
It's really scary.

401
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
He brought up my joke.

402
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,280
Think of a children's song.

403
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,320
You think of one.

404
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,120
A children's song.

405
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,360
Then let's call it...

406
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,800
Sing "Quit Smoking."

407
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,720
"Drop the Handkerchief."

408
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
Aren't we passing the handkerchief right now?

409
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,480
Feels like we're...

410
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
...on the "Little White Boat."

411
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Let's sing "Little White Boat" again.

412
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
"Little White Boat."

413
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,800
"Little White Boat" is actually fitting.

414
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,080
How does it go again? I forgot.

415
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Blue sky.

416
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
White clouds floating.

417
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,840
There's a little...

418
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,000
He sings it so creepily.

419
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
I forgot, I really forgot.

420
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
Find one you know.

421
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,720
One everyone knows.

422
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
How about "Little Swallow"?

423
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
"Little Swallow" works too.

424
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
"Little Swallow" works too.

425
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
Little Swallow.

426
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay.

427
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Okay.

428
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay.

429
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Is everyone ready?

430
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
It'll be more fun if a girl leads.

431
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Alright.

432
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
Sing a bit louder.

433
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
It's fine, he sings it funny.

434
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,400
You sing it really funny.

435
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Once I start singing, I'm not scared anymore.

436
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,760
You need to do the harmony, bro.

437
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, I'll do the harmony.

438
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
I'll do the low harmony.

439
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Wearing a floral dress

440
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,240
Sing a little lower

441
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,960
The swallow says spring here

442
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,880
is the most beautiful

443
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
You’re still trying to scare me

444
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
How do you know?

445
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,760
You’ve gotten smarter

446
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
Above the moon, are you still there?

447
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,560
I’m here

448
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,800
Are you scared?

449
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
I’m not scared anymore

450
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
Can you see it?

451
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,440
I can’t see

452
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Above the moon

453
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,160
Above the moon

454
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Let me tell you

455
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
Someone will come and touch you in a bit

456
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,080
You know when I went to record

457
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,120
this theme song

458
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
and heard the part you sang

459
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,920
I burst out laughing

460
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
What? Didn’t I sing well?

461
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,120
It’s unique

462
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Wearing a floral dress

463
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,680
You sing, then I'll do the rap part

464
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,960
You sing

465
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,840
Little swallow, wearing a floral dress

466
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,480
Every spring you come here

467
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,640
I ask, I ask

468
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
I can't help but ask

469
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
Swallow, swallow

470
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,840
Why do you come here

471
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,720
Your rap is too scary

472
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,120
Really?

473
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,680
Yes

474
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
It feels kind of creepy

475
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
How about this, I'll be the one asking you

476
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
Then the swallow answers

477
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
Then you answer me, okay?

478
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
Little swallow

479
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,080
Wearing a floral dress

480
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,200
Wearing a floral dress

481
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,720
The swallow says

482
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,200
The spring here

483
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,240
You're so scary

484
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Why?

485
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
At the end, you have to add a laugh

486
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,960
The two of us look like "crazy people."

487
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Seriously.

488
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Are you the one kicking me?

489
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,520
Or is someone else kicking me?

490
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,520
Me.

491
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
Stop moving around.

492
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
My leg's numb, let me switch legs.

493
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,360
Coming, baby.

494
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,760
He's not scared.

495
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Get a little more excited.

496
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,360
That's your child.

497
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
He's not afraid, give him extra spice and numbing.

498
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
He really did ask for extra spice and numbing.

499
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
Yeah.

500
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,640
It's spicy.

501
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Why haven't we heard any screams yet?

502
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
You're looking forward to it too.

503
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
Dad.

504
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
Dad.

505
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,560
Come ride the kiddie ride.

506
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,400
Come ride the kiddie ride.

507
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,840
Kiddie ride.

508
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
That's scary.

509
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
Why are there even trap mechanisms?

510
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,040
Get on the kiddie ride.

511
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,120
If you have something to say, just say it.

512
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,560
That's too miserable.

513
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Would you dare?

514
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm scared.

515
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,800
I would definitely be scared.

516
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm not pretending to be tough either.

517
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
But I'll still do it.

518
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,320
I think the mic dropped.

519
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you talking about me?

520
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
The mic almost fell off.

521
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,040
The mic was scared off.

522
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,280
Even the mic got scared off.

523
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,400
Speaking of being stubborn,

524
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,960
you really are.

525
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,440
When you were going down that rope,

526
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,520
Zhou Keyu and I were behind you, laughing at your hands.

527
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
We laughed for a long time.

528
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,640
You kept insisting you weren't scared.

529
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,040
Do you know how much you were shaking?

530
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,360
And he went down together with Sister Ba.

531
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,040
When Sister Ba went down,

532
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,840
she just went straight down quickly.

533
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,960
But he went down little by little, inching along.

534
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,040
And he kept saying it was fine.

535
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
But his hands were shaking the whole time.

536
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,640
It's fine.

537
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
Jin Jing, this isn't scary.

538
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,760
It's fine.

539
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,840
It doesn't matter.

540
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,000
I won't die, it's fine.

541
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,520
And you were still on livestream.

542
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,040
Now I'm taking out my phone.

543
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,760
Turning on the livestream.

544
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
Do you livestream anytime?

545
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,600
Not necessarily.

546
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,000
No.

547
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I stream whenever I feel like it.

548
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,640
That's great, I think it's awesome you do this.

549
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
And I keep watching your clips.

550
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
The more I watch, the more there are.

551
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,599
And the more there are, the more I enjoy watching.

552
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,160
I've gotten to know you better, Liu Yuning.

553
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,440
Okay.

554
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,680
Are you scared?

555
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Dad, come ride the kiddie ride.

556
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
Are you scared?

557
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
I'm fine now.

558
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,920
Went to ride the kiddie ride.

559
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,920
It's really dark.

560
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,440
How did he make it so dark in here?

561
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
It's just like when we film.

562
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
He puts up a black curtain outside.

563
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,920
Just like when we shoot night scenes.

564
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,200
Do you like acting?

565
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,080
What I like is the feeling of being in character.

566
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,440
He's behind you.

567
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,280
What is that?

568
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Open the door.

569
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,880
I can't see the door.

570
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,400
Open the door.

571
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
We can't see the door either.

572
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
We can't see either.

573
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,440
You guys are in the dark.

574
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,640
It's dark.

575
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
Where's Lao Bai?

576
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Lao Bai went offline, he's already gone.

577
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,480
Get out of here.

578
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,400
Let me tell you.

579
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Right now, in the dark,

580
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,360
even if I punch you, you can't report me.

581
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,720
You go ahead.

582
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,040
Brother Bai.

583
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm holding the door, Brother Bai, hurry!

584
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,280
You need to push your limits.

585
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,200
By the end of the recording,

586
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
in these last few episodes, you need to show growth.

587
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
I thought last time when I did the "jump" (rappelling),

588
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
I had already grown.

589
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,920
So life is full of obstacles.

590
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
Once you get over one hurdle, there's another.

591
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,520
It's okay.

592
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,000
You can do it.

593
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,960
We'll wait for you at the door.

594
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,520
Go ahead.

595
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,440
We're all here.

596
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,240
We're all here.

597
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
We're all here, it's fine.

598
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,600
The door is closed.

599
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,680
The door is shut.

600
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,240
Let's go.

601
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
Let's go.

602
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,680
Let's go back.

603
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Or we can just stay here, it's fine.

604
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,440
Those two are interesting.

605
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,680
Doesn't matter.

606
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,400
The door is already closed.

607
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
As long as the door is closed, it's fine.

608
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,880
At this moment,

609
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
I should be banging on that door like crazy.

610
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Forget it.

611
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Where are we going? Back?

612
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Where to?

613
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,720
I don't know.

614
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,280
Have the two of them arrived?

615
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
I haven't seen them.

616
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,440
White-Black game.

617
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,000
Weren't they told to come back?

618
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,760
How did they trick us into going over?

619
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,680
The door is closed.

620
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Forget it, let's not bother.

621
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
Okay.

622
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,960
Above the moon.

623
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Would you dare to go in alone?

624
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
If I really have to, I'll go.

625
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
In your free time,

626
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,240
do you ever play escape rooms or anything like that?

627
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,600
No, I don't.

628
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,040
Kewu Cool.

629
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,360
Let's duel in the dark.

630
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,320
No, that's a bit dangerous.

631
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm afraid you'll actually hit me.

632
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,320
Don't accidentally hurt me.

633
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
You don't know your own strength.

634
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Who doesn't know their own strength?

635
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
Let's close our eyes.

636
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,680
Use our ears to tell things apart.

637
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Locate by sound.

638
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,480
Right, each other's presence.

639
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,920
How about it?

640
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,800
To be honest,

641
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,640
you standing here right now is actually pretty scary.

642
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,320
Because you're wearing something really flashy.

643
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,640
Me?

644
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Her, yeah.

645
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,640
If you suddenly show up like this,

646
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,600
you could really startle those two.

647
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
You could scare them into shock.

648
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Seriously, it's very Chinese style.

649
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
I'll play that role.

650
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll play the great-grandma, how about that?

651
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,960
Great-grandma.

652
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
What's wrong?

653
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,560
Sit in front of the mirror.

654
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Listen to what you're saying.

655
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
Oh no, hers feels really scary.

656
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,240
It's really scary.

657
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,200
Hers is scarier than yours.

658
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,760
What was mine?

659
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
Mine was sitting in the rocking chair.

660
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,920
You just had to sit on the rocking chair.

661
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,440
Sit on the rocking chair.

662
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,400
Then something falls from above.

663
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,520
And there was a doll behind me.

664
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
You managed not to scream through all that.

665
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
No, your courage is bigger than before now.

666
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,400
Do you remember when you first came in season two?

667
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
You're braver than before now.

668
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,240
Yeah, a bit braver, just a little.

669
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,680
Ning is okay now too.

670
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,400
He'll protect you.

671
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
Ning is just toughing it out.

672
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,360
Let me tell you,

673
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
You didn't see Ning in the first season.

674
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,560
Back then, as soon as the lights went out,

675
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,360
he wouldn't move at all.

676
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
He wouldn't take a single step.

677
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
He would just squat down right there.

678
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
Frozen in place when the lights went out.

679
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah.

680
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,960
He got used to it.

681
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,080
The coffin can't be opened.

682
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,760
It can't be opened?

683
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,680
You tried?

684
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,560
I tried.

685
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,320
You're awesome.

686
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
You just walked through all this alone?

687
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,800
Yeah.

688
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,000
But do you know how scary we are?

689
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,080
I want to sit in front of the mirror.

690
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,240
You're the scary one.

691
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,960
There's nothing in the mirror.

692
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Were you scared?

693
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,040
Because after the mirror appeared,

694
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,280
Ning's voice even sounded a bit shaky.

695
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,680
No.

696
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
He was right by my side the whole time.

697
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Luckily, I anticipated this.

698
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,080
I figured that mirror would show up.

699
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,560
Why do you always say my bro Ning is scared?

700
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Is my bro Ning really that scared now?

701
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,240
Don't stand there in that outfit, sit down for a bit.

702
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
Really, am I that scary?

703
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah.

704
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,720
You hopping over to find him is even scarier.

705
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,880
No, just standing at the door like that—

706
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,560
As soon as they open it, they'll see you right away.

707
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,760
There's something here in the middle.

708
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,320
This is a—

709
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,960
Bed.

710
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,080
No, it's a doll.

711
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,920
It has legs.

712
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,160
There are legs here.

713
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,480
Who is this?

714
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,640
That's not one of us.

715
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
Shouldn't we go help?

716
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Open the door, can you open it?

717
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,320
They're inside.

718
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,040
I heard something.

719
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,160
Wait for them.

720
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,120
That platform is too high.

721
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,960
You two need to help.

722
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,440
Okay.

723
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
Otherwise, they can't get down.

724
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,440
Let's wait for them here.

725
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
But let's not make any noise.

726
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Let's stay quiet.

727
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,120
Are we trying to scare them?

728
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't.

729
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
Don't scare them.

730
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,360
Stop scaring them.

731
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
They're already pretty scared.

732
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,040
Close the door.

733
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
Let them explore on their own.

734
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm working with this person right now.

735
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,360
We need a close-up of what's in our hands.

736
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Right hand, over there.

737
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,280
Sorry.

738
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,840
You're so fake.

739
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,520
I give up.

740
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Just need a close-up?

741
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,520
Should I give up or say I love it?

742
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
Say it again.

743
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
We're done filming, teacher.

744
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
Let's do another one.

745
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,120
Even the teacher can't get enough shots.

746
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,560
His camera got startled by you.

747
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,280
It can't focus.

748
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,000
Come here quickly, we're filming a heart for you.

749
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,840
Go ahead.

750
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,040
Why are you acting like this toward your sister now?

751
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,480
Hurry up.

752
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,360
Gucci perfume.

753
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
You didn't even bring a bottle for your sister.

754
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
I'll bring it.

755
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
In such a big square in Shanghai,

756
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
there's such a huge banner.

757
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,040
He asked me to go take a photo and check in.

758
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,640
Is that even fair?

759
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,640
Like this, don't move.

760
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,280
We have to do it this way.

761
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:22,720
Right.

762
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah.

763
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,520
You're smart.

764
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,520
Can you stick it on?

765
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,280
My face is burning.

766
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,600
Why arrange this kind of scene?

767
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
Do we need to reshoot the fainting part?

768
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Are we done, bro?

769
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,760
My hands are sore.

770
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,600
He's nervous.

771
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,200
Let's film a bit longer.

772
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
And the back of the neck.

773
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,800
His neck or my neck?

774
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,160
It's hard to film my neck. Here.

775
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,680
You need to be a bit higher.

776
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
Is our video recording?

777
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,520
I want to interview him.

778
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
I want to interview him.

779
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
What does Flora smell like?

780
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,800
It's a sweet scent.

781
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,880
Just like you.

782
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
It's a perfect match.

783
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Why are you the one helping me up?

784
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Are you happy, Yueyue?

785
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm happy.

786
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,280
Are you tired?

787
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm exhausted.

788
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,360
Really?

789
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,160
Really.

790
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,120
This is tiring for you?

791
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,160
This isn't tiring.

792
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,040
What part is tiring for you?

793
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,120
Lying is exhausting, isn't it?

794
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,040
I understand.

795
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
I know.

796
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,360
Being an assassin is very stressful.

797
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Don't be like this.

798
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,280
She's testing you right now, I'm telling you.

799
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,160
She's testing you.

800
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
She tests everyone.

801
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm just a newcomer.

802
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,960
You don't need to mind her.

803
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,520
You don't need to mind her.

804
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
Her checking for so long is pointless.

805
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,840
Let's go to the main hall and search for evidence again.

806
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,800
Let's go.

807
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,600
Come on, let's go.

808
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,880
Go ahead, my dear.

809
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,680
I can't respond to what you said.

810
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,120
I can't respond.

811
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,040
It's enough if you catch me, not my words.

812
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,960
No need to respond to my words.

813
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Do you need to take the notebook?

814
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,640
I don't want to take the notebook anymore.

815
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,520
I'll hold it for you, dear.

816
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,000
Thank you, dear.

817
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,960
So handsome.

818
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
Do you think my husband is handsome?

819
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
You're so cruel.

820
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,720
I'm someone else's ex-boyfriend.

821
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,400
Do you think your ex-boyfriend is handsome?

822
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
I think my ex-boyfriend

823
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,400
isn't actually an ex-boyfriend.

824
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,440
We haven't broken up yet.

825
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,120
You just "died," that's all.

826
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,440
It's not like we broke up.

827
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,120
"Deceased husband"

828
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,200
You just "died".

829
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,960
It's not like you stopped loving me.

830
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,600
You just exploded, that's all.

831
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Even if you become fragments,

832
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,800
you're still her ex-boyfriend.

833
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,560
So do you still love him?

834
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,960
I've already lost my memory.

835
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,200
I can't even remember how to write the word "love" anymore.

836
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,360
But people can fall in love with the same person over and over again.

837
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
They can fall into the same river again and again.

838
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,080
That's right.

839
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,800
Is there a substitute?

840
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,480
There are substitutes.

841
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,720
There are quite a few here.

842
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,520
Quite a few substitutes.

843
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,280
Who did you just pick?

844
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,560
I promise I won't vote for you this round.

845
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,600
You just need to admit it.

846
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
Stop acting like a clown here, okay?

847
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,320
Okay.

848
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,400
So you were the killer.

849
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,040
I originally suspected Ning.

850
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,120
But now,

851
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,720
seeing you act here just makes me want to laugh.

852
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,400
I can only suspect you now.

853
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
I saw you were sick today,

854
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,120
and wanted to spare you.

855
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,080
But I never expected this.

856
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,320
You always bring trouble upon yourself.

857
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,960
Don't bother with him.

858
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
Even after seven seasons, can't we change things up a bit?

859
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,400
Seriously.

860
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,080
Really.

861
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
This is a coming-of-age detective variety show.

862
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,000
Sorry.

863
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,160
I'll never grow up.

864
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,360
You're still the same kid you used to be.

865
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,960
I used to practice with a staff.

866
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,360
A monkey staff, specifically.

867
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,960
So you're a monkey trainer?

868
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,280
You need to give me some space.

869
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,000
What should we do?

870
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,600
Use your brain.

871
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
You're still the smartest.

872
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,720
Have you seen that movie?

873
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,040
Then, bam, rush over.

874
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,680
Then the two of us should edit it a bit.

875
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,640
Start from here.

876
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,080
What are you doing?

877
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,840
Then switch positions.

878
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,280
Switch positions? Why switch?

879
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
If we switch, that means you're already dead, right?

880
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,920
After switching positions,

881
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,760
we've already passed by each other.

882
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm speechless.

883
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Then see who falls down.

884
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,080
Let's do our duel stances first.

885
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,280
I don't need a duel stance.

886
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,400
Now we're playing.

887
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
One, two, three.

888
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,680
You can't move.

889
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Just freeze and fall down.

890
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
This is so boring.

891
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,640
So boring.

892
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,160
It doesn't feel like there are any moves.

893
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,160
So what just happened

894
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
what does it mean?

895
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Does it have any meaning?

896
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,160
Your knife is still at my place.

897
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,480
So, what do you think?

898
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,120
Do you know how to use that knife?

899
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
My niece plays with it every day.

900
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,360
Your niece plays with it every day?

901
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,480
That knife is twice her height.

902
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,560
Pick

903
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,040
Hit

904
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,600
No

905
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
You're too slow. Let me help you.

906
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,840
Wait a moment, you guys—

907
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,560
Okay, go ahead, bro.

908
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
Eat less.

909
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,320
You look like a "madman" right now.

910
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,960
Do you know that?

911
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,440
Your hair is messy and your face is dirty.

912
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,480
And you're still eating.

913
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,640
There's a cold storage room next to you.

914
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,760
Didn't you know?

915
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,360
I don't feel anything.

916
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Do you feel cold?

917
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,040
Is this tasty?

918
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,080
It's a bit salty.

919
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,800
It's not just a bit salty.

920
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,480
It's salty.

921
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,040
That one is good.

922
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,720
That one is good.

923
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,320
Which one tastes better?

924
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,560
This one, right?

925
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,560
Is this crab yolk pastry?

926
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,760
This is wife cake, right?

927
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,040
I don't like sweet things.

928
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,720
This should be sweet too, right?

929
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You can eat an apple.

930
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,560
I don't eat fruit.

931
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,640
Then let those two go.

932
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,240
Let those two go.

933
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,040
Let's wait for them.

934
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,880
Let's go.

935
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,000
Do you have any in your room?

936
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Of course I have some in my room.

937
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,560
Someone like me, who loves music, chess, painting, and calligraphy,

938
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,560
Brushes.

939
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,080
Ink.

940
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,160
Does this count as ink?

941
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,760
Of course it does.

942
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,720
Paper.

943
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,240
What about an inkstone?

944
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,840
No inkstone.

945
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,960
How do you have ink without an inkstone?

946
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,280
You don't get it, do you?

947
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
Go get one from the master's room.

948
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,280
Isn't this one?

949
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,080
Shouldn't we find some proper ink?

950
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
Does that count as ink?

951
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,880
It counts.

952
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,960
Because it's prop ink.

953
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,040
I'll go take a look in the master's room.

954
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,720
I won a small folding stool from a task today.

955
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,160
I haven't even used it.

956
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm really upset, really sad.

957
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,560
So,

958
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,800
What's a "little vest"?

959
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,960
A small folding stool.

960
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,480
No, let's go.

961
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,440
That one counts.

962
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't laugh at me for acting like a "crazy person."

963
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,560
You've got pastry flakes all around your mouth too.

964
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,640
Do I look like a "crazy person"?

965
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,080
Sometimes.

966
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
When you just said my eyes were bright,

967
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
you really scared me.

968
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,120
Why are your eyes so bright?

969
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
You just said,

970
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,840
"Your eyes are so bright."

971
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,480
That's what you said.

972
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,280
I said, "Really?"

973
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,720
I didn't say,

974
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,920
"Do I look like a crazy person?"

975
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,800
I said, "Do I look like a crazy person right now?"

976
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,200
I asked her, "Do I look like a crazy person?"

977
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,120
She said, "I often think you do."

978
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,360
That's the impression you give people.

979
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,960
Really?

980
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,120
Because I...

981
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,200
want to ask if you dare

982
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,880
to be crazy in love like me.

983
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,960
How does that song go?

984
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
There's a singer later on.

985
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,880
You wouldn't ask him.

986
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,520
What?

987
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,880
When you turn around,

988
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,440
this singer...

989
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,680
What?

990
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,640
If the moon hasn't come yet...

991
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,280
This is obviously sweet.

992
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,080
Why did you say it's salty?

993
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,240
I ate the wrong one.

994
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,040
That one is salty.

995
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,480
The thing on your lips...

996
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,560
Can you take it off?

997
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,640
Girls do this on purpose.

998
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
And then like this...

999
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,400
You don't understand anything.

1000
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,960
Then Zhang Linghe, with a mouthful of sesame, said,

1001
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,840
"The thing on your lips..."

1002
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
Because he has several girlfriends,

1003
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,280
he wipes it off for each of them.

1004
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,040
After you worked together last time,

1005
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,240
after you finished working with him,

1006
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,400
did you think he was very different from what you expected?

1007
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,040
Like, before, you saw how handsome he looked,

1008
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,400
but once you played games together,

1009
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,040
he turned out like that.

1010
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,480
What are you trying to do?

1011
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,560
I want you to know your reputation.

1012
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,880
Your reputation is pretty good.

1013
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,120
Yeah, his reputation is fine.

1014
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,760
He's a really nice person.

1015
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,880
He said Bai was taken away by the "she" people.

1016
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
Look, we've said it four times.

1017
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,280
You only just heard it now.

1018
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,520
Old Bai was taken away.

1019
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,640
He was taken away.

1020
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,240
Really?

1021
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,080
Yeah.

1022
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,800
Who took him?

1023
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,320
He was taken by the "she" people.

1024
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,800
What do we do now?

1025
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
He said Bai was taken by the "she" people.

1026
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,440
Is that true?

1027
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,600
What are you guys here for?

1028
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Don't forget, you're the responsible one.

1029
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,400
I need to reflect on myself.

1030
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,600
I'm not quite myself today.

1031
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,120
Yeah.

1032
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,640
Maybe I just miss Reba too much.

1033
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,360
Why is your face all smudged?

1034
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
I really miss Reba.

1035
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Seriously?

1036
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,520
Wait, are you being serious?

1037
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,040
Does no one even care?

1038
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,360
Then why didn’t you protect him?

1039
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,160
How could I protect him?

1040
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,760
That NPC

1041
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,040
can’t move.

1042
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,800
NPCs can’t move.

1043
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,760
Then how did he get taken away?

1044
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,640
Only he can interact with us.

1045
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,720
Don’t you get it?

1046
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,320
Is he going to the bathroom?

1047
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
He’s just saying that on purpose.

1048
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,679
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

1049
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,520
He really was taken away.

1050
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,960
Would he be calmly setting this up here if that were true?

1051
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,080
You’re listening to his nonsense again.

1052
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Did you take everything?

1053
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,760
I did.

1054
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,679
I'm going to the bathroom.

1055
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,159
Tell them I got taken away.

1056
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,400
Okay.

1057
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,520
You have to run back looking really scared, alright?

1058
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,320
You have to say I did it to save you.

1059
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,719
You're even giving me a task now.

1060
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,800
I'll be quick in the bathroom.

1061
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,040
Alright.

1062
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Here he comes.

1063
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
He went to the bathroom.

1064
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,040
He's coming.

1065
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,440
He told me to tell you this.

1066
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,960
He was taken away by the bathroom... the bathro...

1067
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
He was taken by the bathroom.

1068
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,440
He was taken away by the bathroom.

1069
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
It's set up.

1070
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
And then?

1071
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,600
Should we bow to it?

1072
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,960
Look, this is...

1073
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,360
What kind of logic is this?

1074
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,960
It's all set.

1075
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,159
No.

1076
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,360
You should moo at it.

1077
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,520
Moo.

1078
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,440
You sing that song about the moon.

1079
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,640
I should sing

1080
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,320
"Two Butterflies"

1081
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,960
"Two Butterflies"

1082
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,280
How does it go again?

1083
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,720
You sing it.

1084
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:11,960
How do you sing it?

1085
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,280
Darling

1086
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Darling, fly slowly

1087
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,400
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead

1088
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,320
Is it only when you two sing

1089
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
that the secret door will open?

1090
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,840
Yes.

1091
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,360
Let's turn off the lights first.

1092
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
Everyone, close your eyes now.

1093
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,320
Murderer, go press the switch yourself.

1094
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,640
You're doing this again.

1095
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,200
Here we go again.

1096
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,280
Let's just press the one from before and go.

1097
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,880
Let's try walking through it once.

1098
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,040
No need to walk, wait a second.

1099
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,840
I also think we don't need to walk.

1100
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,520
Why do we need to walk?

1101
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,240
Why walk at all?

1102
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
Can you put down the pastry?

1103
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,200
You're getting crumbs all over yourself.

1104
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Finish your cookie first.

1105
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,920
You're getting it all over your pants.

1106
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
That pastry is really tasty.

1107
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,400
If I weren't full

1108
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,000
I'd want to eat more.

1109
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
Don't leave sticks at the scene next time.

1110
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,760
Do you know how much men love sticks?

1111
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,680
No one.

1112
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
Only him.

1113
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
You think Liu Yuning didn't play with it?

1114
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,320
He was there the whole time.

1115
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,720
Really?

1116
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah, I've been playing with it the whole time.

1117
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
Boys usually

1118
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,800
when they get a really straight stick,

1119
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,080
they just can't put it down.

1120
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
They even want to find a bundle of grass to whip it.

1121
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,760
Mainly because this stick feels just right in your hand.

1122
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
Look, it fits perfectly right here.

1123
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,320
You know?

1124
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,360
Like a dog-beating staff.

1125
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Put it to the side.

1126
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,920
Just set it aside for now.

1127
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Don't get it in the shot.

1128
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,560
It's not in the shot, it won't show up.

1129
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,280
Put it behind you.

1130
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
I get Chinese-style horror.

1131
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,520
Doesn't Chinese horror involve scratching your head?

1132
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,400
So Chinese horror is about having no expression.

1133
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
No, it's a very gentle smile.

1134
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,040
Just a slight smile.

1135
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,280
The happier you look, the scarier it is.

1136
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,080
It's like a fake smile.

1137
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,480
Your eyes don't smile, but your mouth does.

1138
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
Eyes not smiling.

1139
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,880
Like this.

1140
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,960
Do I look good like this?

1141
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
Doesn't that look kind of dumb?

1142
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,880
Like a puppet.

1143
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,000
Everyone, come on.

1144
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,000
Three, two, one.

1145
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Then the four men standing

1146
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
can turn left and right a bit.

1147
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
Turn left, turn right.

1148
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
Let's face away from her.

1149
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,480
That's it.

1150
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,840
Your fever's gone down, right?

1151
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,520
Everyone, come on, let's do another round.

1152
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,520
Okay, three, two, one.

1153
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,600
Now, the two in the middle,

1154
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,080
move a little closer to the center.

1155
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,680
The two in the middle, move a bit more toward the center.

1156
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,240
Okay, try not to lean on anything else.

1157
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Just stand up straight.

1158
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,760
Alright, here we go.

1159
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,960
Should we look more formal?

1160
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,400
A bit more formal.

1161
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,720
And you two, face each other a little.

1162
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,320
A bit more formal.

1163
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,760
What?

1164
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
You two, just a little...

1165
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,040
Face each other a bit more.

1166
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
Like this, right?

1167
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,720
Okay, that's good.

1168
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,920
Alright, that's a wrap.

1169
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,480
Thank you, everyone.

1170
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,760
Thank you.

1171
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,640
Thanks for your hard work.

1172
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,680
Fell asleep.

1173
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,200
Who is this?

1174
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,120
Who is it?

1175
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
The sun is out.

1176
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,280
No wonder I woke up.

1177
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,360
Do you know why?

1178
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,920
Why?

1179
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,360
Because I'm a sunshine boy.

1180
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,800
It's really good to get some sun.

1181
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
Sunshine boy.

1182
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Isn't that a song?

1183
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,440
Yeah.

1184
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,920
I want to eat peanuts, bro.

1185
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
Buy them.

1186
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,840
Buy whatever she wants to eat, get it for her.

1187
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,920
May wealth come from all directions.

1188
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,440
No money, but wealth will come.

1189
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,440
Wealth will come.

1190
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,560
I want this one.

1191
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Actually, both are tasty.

1192
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,040
Then you eat this one.

1193
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,720
But I can tell it's delicious, so...

1194
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,880
That's fine.

1195
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,240
Turn around and give a wave with the fan.

1196
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,560
Okay.

1197
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah, I...

1198
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,160
Feed it a little.

1199
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,400
Then it'll be friendlier to you.

1200
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,680
Okay.

1201
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,840
So detailed.

1202
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,240
Is it that detailed?

1203
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,000
Don't shout, I won't shout anymore.

1204
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Teachers.

1205
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm really afraid of shouting.

1206
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,280
It's not a Hengdian horse.

1207
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,000
If you shout at a Hengdian horse, it starts running.

1208
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,520
As soon as you say three, two, one, go, it runs.

1209
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,400
How much do you weigh?

1210
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,440
None of your business.

1211
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
You definitely don't even weigh 140.
