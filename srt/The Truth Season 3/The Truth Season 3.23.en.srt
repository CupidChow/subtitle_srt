00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,200
Yesterday

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,360
"The Classic Everflow Ship"

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,760
The manager of the Pirate Mansion

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
Tui Houlang died under mysterious circumstances

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,400
The detective team discovered

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,160
Tui Houlang was actually the former Captain Dash

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,280
Tui Qianlang

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,400
Hearing loss in both ears

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:27,960
Blurred vision

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,440
The same person

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,040
Exactly the same

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,760
But the mastermind behind these misdeeds

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,160
seems to be someone else

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,560
Meanwhile

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Tui Sanniang's treasure

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,360
is still missing

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,240
Who is Ren Weishan, the late-night visitor?

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
Tui Houlang sent me

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
Your boss is dead

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,320
There are still secrets waiting to be uncovered at the Pirate Mansion

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,560
After the initial investigation

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,800
the people involved in this case have been identified.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,160
Ba Jiaoshan is the detective for this case.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,040
What is this?

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
She is actually the culprit.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,080
Who, me?

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,640
You.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,680
After all this time

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
five people are trying to identify one detective.

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,240
Ten thirty—wait a second.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,800
Let me write that down.

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,680
What about the back? Is there anything?

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes.

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,240
Inside the storage box.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,520
Wait a moment.

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,240
Then search again.

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,120
You're amazing.

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,080
He actually knew since he was a child

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,240
what was happening on that island.

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,880
That's why he would

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,720
We all are

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,080
trying to make these people immortal.

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,560
They will

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,160
come in.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
I knew he was here.

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,720
He sat here.

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Yesterday, I saw two people.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,840
It's very likely.

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
A lot of things we do are

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,440
No.

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,720
You two are confusing everyone.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,440
There must be someone

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,120
helping one of those two.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,640
Right.

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
Okay.

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Right now, you seem a bit...

57
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,440
The flaw has been exposed.

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,720
Check it for me.

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,600
Hurry, next step.

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
He ruined this.

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,840
This is all I can say about what I found here.

62
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
You didn't find it again.

63
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
It was just where you were looking.

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm really a "beautiful fool."

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
I think there's a key point.

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
The cause of his death now—

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,640
has already been determined.

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,920
By—

69
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
He was already at—

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,160
He killed this person.

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Then cooperate with us.

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
Yes.

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,560
I think

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Is it a blank (drawing)?

75
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,360
Because

76
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,320
Wait a moment.

77
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
What does this walkie-talkie mean?

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,440
There's something inside.

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,840
What is this thing?

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,240
I want to see it first.

81
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
Something that's unfavorable to me.

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
I'll eat it right away.

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,400
That's just one possibility I'm suggesting.

84
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Is it possible that it's us?

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
He has symptoms of amnesia.

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,760
Have you taken this before?

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
If anyone has seen this,

88
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
then it must be you.

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
But there's still one thing that hasn't been resolved.

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
It's the two of us.

91
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
You four.

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,480
I've got goosebumps.

93
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,400
I have to say,

94
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,600
this photo makes me look handsome again.

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
You are

96
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
the three drawings that were just on the phone.

97
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
It's these three.

98
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
It could be you.

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,600
It's me.

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Because the three of us have already

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,200
So the three of us

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
are definitely not the culprit.

103
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,040
Because the three of us have already

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,240
Right.

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,640
So it must be He and you.

106
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Why didn't the culprit

107
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,120
was present.

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
I already knew before that I would

109
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,480
Then wouldn't I have known?

110
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
I think he

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,640
What he just said was correct.

112
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
If the culprit didn't

113
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,400
Is there any need for me to do it again

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
in another way?

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
What are you doing?

116
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
What are you guys trying to do?

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
What are you guys trying to do?

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
We still...

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,079
No.

120
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,760
Wait a second.

121
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,080
Wait a second.

122
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,080
What are you doing?

123
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,720
They're ignoring you.

124
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
There must be a hidden clue in this painting.

125
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,040
This A...

126
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
T...

127
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,400
P...

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Like this.

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,560
One, two, three, four.

130
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,440
One, two, three, four.

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
Why are there dead bodies everywhere?

132
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,880
Dead bodies everywhere.

133
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Before we start collecting evidence,

134
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
You should explain yourself first.

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,520
That's how they treat me.

136
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,440
Wait a second.

137
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,880
Then why...

138
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
Why can you two be ruled out?

139
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
If the two of us...

140
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
If we can't tell the difference, we can't be ruled out.

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,640
Why can you two...

142
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,960
be ruled out just like that?

143
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,640
This killer...

144
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,280
didn't inhale the poison.

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,760
Right?

146
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:57,880
Right?

147
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
So this killer must now...

148
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,760
After the killer committed the crime...

149
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
To cover it up perfectly...

150
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
No.

151
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
I don't think it's him.

152
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
His bag is...

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
Time-limited.

154
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,240
Five hours.

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,280
Oh no, I can't draw at all, what should I do?

156
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
They're all that kind of style.

157
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,240
Like palace style, or whatever style.

158
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
It's so hard to draw.

159
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
You make it sound like I could actually draw it.

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Can you put it on my...

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,440
neck, around my cervical spine area?

162
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,960
Can you put one there?

163
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,760
This is what I'll look like when I'm old.

164
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Oh my god, it's so hot.

165
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Sorry, everyone.

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,600
This one person is already big enough.

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,640
How did you guys even come up with

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,920
such a "vicious" little game?

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,520
The fans of all the teachers,

170
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,600
they're not like this.

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,560
It's just that my abilities are really limited.

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,520
Sorry.

173
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
I even drew myself with an oval face.

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,960
Sixteen seconds left on the countdown.

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,200
Okay.

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
Finished drawing.

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,800
Tell us about the concept behind your drawing.

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,480
It's abstract.

179
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
And then this one...

180
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Number eleven is Zhang Linghe.

181
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Number fourteen is Zhou Keyu.

182
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Number ten is Liu Yuning.

183
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
Number seven is Bai Yu.

184
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,800
This is me.

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Because I didn't participate in this episode,

186
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
I don't have a jersey.

187
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
Jin Jing.

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,480
And hers is also a dress.

189
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
Please draw a scene from since you started recording the show

190
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
of the six of you eating the best meal together.

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,840
A scene from that meal.

192
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,000
How do you even draw that?

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,640
Do you feel anything?

194
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,919
Of course I feel something, how could I not?

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
Bro, do you feel anything?

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah, I feel it.

197
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,800
Are you sure?

198
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,120
Why would I lie to you about this?

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,200
I really feel it.

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,440
Look, even my hands are shaking.

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,920
Finished drawing.

202
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,440
This meal,

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
was from that time at the factory.

204
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
We used plates to get the boxed meals.

205
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,200
And we had steamed buns that meal.

206
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,360
Eating this.

207
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
This is so tasty.

208
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,440
What is this?

209
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,720
No idea.

210
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Probably goes really well with rice.

211
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
Everyone ate pretty...

212
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
pretty well.

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
Ate a lot.

214
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
Mainly,

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
we were wolfing down the steamed buns.

216
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,640
After the buns, we ate rice.

217
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah, that meal.

218
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,280
That meal, we ate...

219
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Everyone ate pretty well, yeah.

220
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,440
Please draw the moment

221
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,400
when you were the most "brave" since joining the show.

222
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,040
The moment I was the most "brave"...

223
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,440
Okay.

224
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,280
I'm about to jump up.

225
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
This is really nerve-wracking.

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
It's not a big jump,

227
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
but it's especially nerve-wracking.

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
They said there was one time

229
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
when I protected them.

230
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,280
So I'll draw that scene.

231
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,680
This one.

232
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Okay.

233
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,560
Everyone's here.

234
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
Alright, can we turn it off now, sis?

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
Come on, let's turn it off.

236
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
After we're done, I want to use the bathroom.

237
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
What is this?

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
This was from the first episode.

239
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,160
These are two of them.

240
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,480
Did you see that?

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
These teeth are really scary.

242
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,960
That's how it is.

243
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,640
Two zombie-like ones.

244
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,360
This one is...

245
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,480
Old Bai.

246
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,280
He went over to catch them.

247
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,960
He used his hand to grab them.

248
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,280
Then these two guys were stunned.

249
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,360
The two of them went the wrong way.

250
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,560
These two guys.

251
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,280
I don't know, but it was really dark.

252
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,000
These two guys were confused.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
They went the wrong way.

254
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,640
They went in another direction.

255
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,600
But the zombies were over here.

256
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,000
And then...

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
These two little girls are...

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
Look, she has braids.

259
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Twisted braids.

260
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
There are little braids here.

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
These two hugged each other, scared out of their wits.

262
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
This is the handsome me.

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
Using my strong arms here.

264
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
I protected the two of them.

265
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,480
Standing in front of them.

266
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
This became the most "embarrassing" scene.

267
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,040
I've grown.

268
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
I've grown, definitely.

269
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,760
I need to draw

270
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,440
a scene from "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

271
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
Since we started filming,

272
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,240
this was the scene that made me sweat the most.

273
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,000
Please help me pick up the pen.

274
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
My drawing skills are limited.

275
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,840
But I've tried my best to recreate

276
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,920
that scene.

277
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
I wonder if everyone can guess it.

278
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Can you guess what it is?

279
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,040
This is

280
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
the scene of the six of us dancing.

281
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,080
It's when we all danced together in the livestream.

282
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Let me try again.

283
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,880
Yes, the dance from "Black Soil Era".

284
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,400
That was the scene that made me sweat the most.

285
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay.

286
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,800
But these six people look a bit abstract.

287
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,080
But the idea is still there.

288
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,800
Six people.

289
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
And two of them have braids,

290
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
which means they're girls.

291
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,560
And then six people,

292
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
standing in a row on stage, dancing.

293
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,560
It should be pretty recognizable, right?

294
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
Anyway, I think it's quite accurate.

295
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Let's put on the therapy device first.

296
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,520
It's so cool.

297
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
Wait a moment.

298
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
It's too big.

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
No.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
Look, my hand is already like this.

301
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,280
Look.

302
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,760
Timer starts.

303
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,200
Please draw

304
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,560
the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning".

305
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,120
Since the recording began,

306
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
what was the most team-spirited moment for you?

307
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,320
Okay.

308
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
No.

309
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,080
Okay, I'm done drawing.

310
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,600
Alright.

311
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Watch closely.

312
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,080
Everyone, what I drew here—

313
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,640
I don't know if you can guess it.

314
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,160
This is—

315
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
This is actually our—

316
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,080
the part where we escaped above the pool.

317
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,600
And this is the staircase.

318
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
This is where we went down into the pool.

319
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,880
And then—

320
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,880
And this is me and Ning.

321
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,160
And this part—

322
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Bro, is this right?

323
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Bro.

324
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,480
And then—

325
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Then, one by one,

326
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,360
we carried these people up.

327
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
One person up.

328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,360
Ready, three,

329
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,400
two, one, lift!

330
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Two people up.

331
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,120
Three people up.

332
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,160
Four people up.

333
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,440
Finally, we carried Ning up.

334
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
Everyone among us

335
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,200
was very supportive and

336
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
self-sacrificing.

337
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Everyone wanted

338
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
to save their teammates.

339
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,520
Just like that,

340
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,120
okay,

341
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
the challenge was a success.

342
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
Quick, stop!

343
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Tempting Snack Shop

344
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
Delicious Cafeteria

345
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,960
And Interesting Props Room

346
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
Which one do you want to choose?

347
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,600
Bring them all, let me see.

348
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
You pick one more.

349
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,080
You pick something different every day.

350
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,040
Who knows what's on top?

351
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
Yesterday's ones were useless.

352
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,200
You were crunching sunflower seeds yesterday.

353
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
How about the deluxe fruit platter?

354
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
I want this irresistible marinated snack.

355
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,680
I'll still choose the cafeteria.

356
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,800
Let's go with the cafeteria.

357
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
Barbecue, then.

358
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,360
Northeast Combo Meal

359
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Let's see what's available.

360
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,760
So now,

361
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,800
Props Room, Snack Shop, and Cafeteria

362
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Which one should we pick?

363
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,480
Pick the Props Room.

364
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
My hands are still itching to do something.

365
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
What do you think is flowing in my veins right now?

366
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
What's coursing through me?

367
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
It's electricity.

368
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,640
I want a weapon.

369
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
"I have a lot of guts," right?

370
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
Do you know what this is?

371
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
Wait, how do you have all these props?

372
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Feels like you have some kind of special fetish.

373
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,440
What kind of special fetish?

374
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,840
Come on, man.

375
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,360
How is this a special fetish?

376
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,560
This thing is called a "Hao Da Dan."

377
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,080
When it's dark,

378
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
each of us holds one.

379
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,680
That way, we won't lose each other.

380
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,760
We can move forward together.

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,400
I think so too.

382
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Is that really necessary?

383
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,120
What, you don't need it? Others do.

384
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,680
Who needs it?

385
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,840
Look at us.

386
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,240
We're connected in a line.

387
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,520
Do you get it?

388
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
That's what I mean.

389
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,320
This way, we won't get separated in the dark.

390
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,720
What, do we not have hands?

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,040
We still need to hold a ring?

392
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,960
That's not it.
