1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,000
So she knows she's very beautiful.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
She definitely knows.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,040
She definitely knows.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,080
She's already so beautiful.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,760
Try another pose.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,080
Squat down and scratch your head.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
No, move in a bit.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,440
What are you doing?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,360
What are you doing?

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,360
You're really squatting.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,600
Feels like we're back to the days of wearing headgear.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,320
Yeah.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,840
Right?

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,280
Yeah.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it okay now?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,560
It's fine now.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,520
Why don't we just

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,480
swing over with the wire like he just said?

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
I think that would be cooler.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,880
That would be all of it, it would go much smoother.

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,320
First, rise up.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Extreme challenge.

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,720
Then do two wire sections.

24
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,040
That would

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,400
be cool, pulling that waistline.

26
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,000
I thought the swinging you meant was

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
with our legs.

28
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,920
Swinging over like that would be cool too.

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Mine is broken.

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
The glue came off.

31
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,280
Doesn't matter.

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Yours fell off too.

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Just take it off.

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,560
What does this mean? This is a prop.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,160
So she knows she's very pretty.

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
She definitely knows.

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,200
She definitely knows.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
She's so pretty.

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,560
Yeah.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
You could say I don't know I'm pretty, maybe.

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,120
You really kind of don't know.

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,280
Let's go.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Jin Jing.

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Come on.

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Let me take a picture of you two.

46
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
You two stand in the (elevator) corner.

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
Mr. Bai Yu, let's wait here.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
I know.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,760
I just like to wander around when there's nothing to do.

50
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,600
You wrapped up filming.

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah, finished filming.

52
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
What have you been up to lately?

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
Just running around.

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,120
Running.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,840
Yeah.

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
Where are you running to?

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen.

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,080
What are you running there for?

59
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,000
Magazine shoots.

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,120
Then livestreams.

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Variety show recordings.

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
Okay.

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
But this time when I go back,

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Once I'm back in Beijing, I'll be free.

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,880
I can stay at your place for a couple of days.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, that's good.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Everyone, look over here.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Three.

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,920
Two.

70
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,560
One.

71
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
Alright, one more time, look at me.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,240
Okay.

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
All done.

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,680
Alright, everyone, change your pose.

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
Change your pose again.

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
I want you to look cooler.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Got it.

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,360
Squat down and scratch your head.

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,440
Then just squat down.

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,360
My stomach hurts.

81
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,880
That works too.

82
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,040
That's fine.

83
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
No, move in a bit.

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,320
What are you doing?

85
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,240
What are you doing?

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,240
You're really squatting.

87
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,200
That's good.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
Alright, everyone, look at me. Come on.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Now

90
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Should we put on our hats now?

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Go ahead and wear it.

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,840
What about our hairstyles?

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,360
Nothing we can do.

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,280
We have to wear them.

95
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,920
We have no choice but to wear them.

96
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm just worried about my bleeding.

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:26,840
You know what I mean.

98
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
So you especially need to wear it.

99
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
If you start bleeding for a bit,

100
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
your face will be covered in blood.

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,600
It'll all be red.

102
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,560
Still looks pretty cool.

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm speechless about this hat.

104
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,080
It's so big, it's like a helmet.

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
It is a helmet.

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
It's literally a helmet.

107
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
The back of your head is so round.

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,600
Aren't they all the same?

109
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
They're all the same.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Hers does seem especially...

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
Hers is especially round.

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,320
She has a small head.

113
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,520
It really looks like a watermelon.

114
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
You look like a newborn baby.

115
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
Your elbow hit my head again.

116
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Tighten this for me a bit.

117
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,320
How do I tighten this? I don't know how.

118
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,760
That window, the open one.

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,800
How do you do this?

120
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,440
Do what?

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,200
How do I make it tighter?

122
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
A bit tighter.

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
Tighter.

124
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,640
Wait a second.

125
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,240
Don't pinch his skin.

126
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,440
Sorry.

127
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,960
Let me see.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
This doesn't really help.

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,880
Let me see how you did it.

130
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,200
You pull this part.

131
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,080
That should work.

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,200
Feels like the days when we wore helmets.

133
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,920
Yeah.

134
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,440
Right?

135
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,880
Right.

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
Is it good now?

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,160
It's good now.

138
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
Pull the one inside, I think.

139
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Done.

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,440
Why don't we just

141
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,400
swing over with the wire like he just said?

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
I think that would be cooler.

143
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,800
That would be all of us, and it would go much smoother.

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,240
First, go up.

145
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Extreme challenge.

146
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,960
Then use two wires, in two sections.

147
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
Very cool, pull that waist line.

148
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,880
Just pull the waist line.

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
You mean pull the secondary wire, right?

150
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Yeah, pull the waist line.

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
Wait, let me see yours.

152
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Let me see yours.

153
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
No, that's not the normal way.

154
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
Normally, it's one high and one low.

155
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
Take the zipline across.

156
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,040
Like Batman, shoot a line across.

157
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Then hook onto the wall.

158
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
Slide in, through the window.

159
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,360
Go in one by one.

160
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
That's the coolest way.

161
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
I thought you meant swinging like that.

162
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
With our legs.

163
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
Swinging across would be cool too.

164
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,320
What do you mean?

165
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,680
Then you'd have to hang in midair.

166
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
You'd have to jump.

167
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Grab this and swing across.

168
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Then let go.

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
That's too dangerous, that won't work.

170
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
And you'd have to try several times, alone.

171
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

172
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,360
We should just pull a line straight across.

173
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,920
Just ride the zipline across.

174
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,600
That works.

175
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,840
I got it.

176
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,160
Later, the director, or the assistant director,

177
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,520
he'll say this is actually a film he made.

178
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
We're all actors in it.

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Thanks for our dedicated performances.

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,280
It's all very real and so on.

181
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
I think that's how it'll be.

182
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,560
It's possible.

183
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Do you think these "zombies" make sense?

184
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
This world makes sense.

185
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
I don't believe there are "zombies."

186
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,080
It makes sense.

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
So he says he's a monster.

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,040
A monster.

189
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
A monster infected by a virus.

190
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Alright, comrades,

191
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
I think we shouldn't use umbrellas.

192
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
Because even the "zombie" teacher isn't using one.

193
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,960
Stop using them.

194
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Using umbrellas looks weird.

195
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Let's all put them away.

196
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
Let's go, come on.

197
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,120
His hair...

198
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,920
What's wrong with his hair?

199
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm going to bleed.

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
You won't.

201
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,000
It's really fine.

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
If you bleed, it's on me.

203
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
You won't bleed.

204
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,320
I have experience.

205
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,960
I spray it all the time.

206
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,520
Are you sure?

207
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,960
Really.

208
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,400
Alright.

209
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Let's hide for a bit.

210
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,120
No.

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:04,960
That's not it.

212
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
Let's hide by the car, over here.

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
There are people by the car.

214
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Hide.

215
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Mine is broken.

216
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,840
What the heck?

217
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,480
Mine's broken.

218
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
The glue came off.

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,040
Doesn't matter.

220
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Let me try to stick it back for you, see if it works.

221
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,320
It probably won't stick.

222
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,840
Hold it for a bit.

223
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,320
Once it's come apart, it definitely won't stick.

224
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
If it suddenly falls, it'll hit your face.

225
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,360
Then just tear the whole thing off.

226
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,960
Tear the whole thing off.

227
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay, I'll hold it.

228
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,320
What are you doing?

229
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,400
The glue on mine came off.

230
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Can't you guys hide in a place like this—

231
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
—where there's no rain?

232
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,040
So smart.

233
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,960
Okay, now I am—

234
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,160
—the selfie guy.

235
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,520
So slow.

236
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Which entrance should we use?

237
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,280
That one.

238
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
Let's go in through that window.

239
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,320
The director is so pitiful.

240
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,840
From my perspective.

241
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Where is she going?

242
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,000
What is she doing?

243
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
She's going to risk herself.

244
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Help us!

245
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,400
Help us!

246
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,640
Is anyone there?

247
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
Let me interview you—how are you feeling right now?

248
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
How do you feel right now?

249
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,120
What?

250
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,600
What kind of feeling?

251
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,840
I got infected, I'm a bit confused.

252
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
Infected by what?

253
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,640
Why am I like this?

254
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Help me tie this, please.

255
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
You weren't bitten.

256
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
Okay, not nervous at all, you...

257
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm nervous.

258
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
This understanding of the set scenario

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,360
is still a bit lacking.

260
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,040
You're nervous?

261
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm really nervous.

262
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,080
I can't tell that you're nervous.

263
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,880
But I have to try to stay calm.

264
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
I have to try to stay calm.

265
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,200
This one's a bit too slow, isn't it?

266
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
It's really slow.

267
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,800
If it's too fast, it's dangerous.

268
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah, this definitely has to be slow.

269
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Block the rain for a bit.

270
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
It's fine.

271
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,040
She wants to give the director an umbrella.

272
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
Okay.

273
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
That's really nice.

274
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
Help us!

275
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,080
Help me!

276
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,600
Help me!

277
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,800
Help me!

278
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,360
Help me!

279
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,520
There’s equipment here.

280
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,120
Take more over, give it all to them.

281
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
This, to them.

282
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
This guy will block the door with this.

283
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,960
Right?

284
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,520
No, he won’t.

285
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,080
But I think

286
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
by the time it’s our last group,

287
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
this guy will turn into a "zombie".

288
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,800
and follow us inside.

289
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Definitely.

290
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
I thought we were supposed to climb this ladder.

291
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,280
This is even—this is way too dangerous.

292
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,480
He wouldn't dare let you climb this.

293
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
No one would dare climb this.

294
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,040
Yeah.

295
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
If your foot slips, you'll fall all the way down.

296
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
There are no "zombies" in this building.

297
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Really?

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
All the doors are locked.

299
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,680
There probably aren't any.

300
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
Maybe the place we're going to

301
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,200
is actually the lab.

302
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Isn't it?

303
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Yeah.

304
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
The "zombie" lab.

305
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,640
He said so.

306
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah, the "zombie" lab.

307
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,640
When I passed by here yesterday,

308
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
I told you about it.

309
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
I said there must be a story on the third floor today.

310
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,200
No, you didn't.

311
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
When we walked here after work,

312
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
I told you then.

313
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,200
No, you didn't.

314
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
It's fine, you never listen to me anyway.

315
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm used to it.

316
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
Our landing spot was just over there.

317
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
Over there, in the grass.

318
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,800
This one.

319
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,880
This.

320
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah.

321
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,520
We are

322
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,240
Just now, we were supposed to

323
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,920
come down from this roof, right?

324
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
It's so high.

325
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
Can't see.

326
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,480
Can't see from this side.

327
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,760
Wait a moment.

328
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,560
No.

329
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
This must be over fifty meters, right?

330
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
It's not over fifty meters.

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
No way, that's an exaggeration.

332
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,760
Isn't this fifty meters?

333
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,280
It's not fifty meters.

334
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
I think it's about

335
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,680
around fifty meters.

336
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
More than thirty, maybe thirty or forty.

337
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,720
No.

338
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,480
We're on the rooftop

339
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,160
plus an extra platform built out.

340
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,440
Right?

341
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,000
So with that added,

342
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
that's another two meters.

343
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Three.

344
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,520
That's more than two meters.

345
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,840
Then add a four-meter platform.

346
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
A platform that's four meters high.

347
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,960
At the speed those two are going,

348
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,880
the four of us would already be down there

349
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,520
and bitten to death.

350
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah.

351
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,200
We...

352
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
What's that sound, man?

353
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,680
It's nothing.

354
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,200
It's fine.

355
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,440
Yours fell off too.

356
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Just take it off.

357
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,360
Alright, just tear it off.

358
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,520
Are you okay?

359
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,400
Tear it, just pull it off.

360
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,080
Pull it off.

361
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,800
If you stick it back on,

362
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
it'll still fall off and hit your face.

363
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,080
Yeah, let's just hold it ourselves.

364
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
Let's take selfies like this.

365
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah, let's take selfies.

366
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,120
Take your selfie like this, it looks cooler.

367
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Yours fell off too, right?

368
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,360
Yeah, mine fell off.

369
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,960
They all fell off.

370
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,840
Because this strong adhesive

371
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,720
loses its stickiness when it gets wet.

372
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,160
Just take it off and hold it by hand.

373
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,200
Yours hasn't fallen off yet.

374
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,760
It hasn't fallen off yet?

375
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Yours is still on.

376
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,280
Is yours about to fall off?

377
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,200
Is it about to fall off too?

378
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Not yet.

379
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,240
No, not for a while.

380
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,760
It's pretty secure.

381
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, not anytime soon.

382
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,720
It's not scary if it hits your face, it's fine.

383
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
No, I just mean in a bit.

384
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
It fell off when we went up.

385
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Alright, next group.

386
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,960
When you were filming that

387
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
movie "Burning City" before,

388
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,400
did you practice this stuff?

389
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
Yeah, I did.

390
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,880
We went straight to the fire station to practice.

391
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
We stayed at the fire station for three days.

392
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,160
That's true.

393
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,000
Speed skating.

394
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
Exactly the same as the professionals.

395
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,080
Exactly the same as the professionals.

396
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,640
It's just that they might do it in ten seconds,

397
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
while we might need a minute.

398
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,800
Yeah, you have to

399
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
experience it.

400
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,320
This morning,

401
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,960
that person actually bit me and left a teeth mark here.

402
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,560
How did you get infected?

403
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,680
Well,

404
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
just being together was enough to get infected.

405
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,200
I got scratched.

406
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
Scratched my neck.

407
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
Okay.

408
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,240
Let’s act more realistically this afternoon.

409
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah, I was thinking the same.

410
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
Sis, will it be dark later?

411
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
How will they run if it’s dark?

412
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
I mean, will it be very dark?

413
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,160
Not very dark.

414
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,240
If it’s too dark, they’ll all fall.

415
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Just a little light.

416
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,120
A little bit of light.

417
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,840
That should be fine.

418
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
Don’t make it too bright, or we’ll feel awkward.

419
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,360
The two of us will go in.

420
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,880
Do we need to learn from the supporting actors

421
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,800
how to act like zombies?

422
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
No need.

423
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
We’re talented actors like us,

424
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
with extraordinary talent.

425
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,680
We have an amazing talent for acting as zombies.

426
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
I’m the king of zombies.

427
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,920
So I don’t need to do anything.

428
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
I’ll just stand at the back and watch.

429
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
I’ve been acting as a zombie since I was little.

430
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah, you’re the number one zombie henchman.

431
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,320
Why am I the henchman?

432
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
You’re the king of zombies.

433
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,280
Because you’re agile.

434
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,320
I’m old, weak, sick, and frail—can’t help it.

435
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,240
What happened after we came out today?

436
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,840
After we came out, we were with—

437
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,720
We came out together with Bamian Linglong.

438
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
Then Bamian Linglong—

439
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,480
On the way out, she told us—

440
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
She was about to lose consciousness.

441
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,440
Then—

442
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
We got separated from her.

443
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
How did you get separated?

444
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,320
You clearly kicked her away.

445
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Wait a minute.

446
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,680
Later, she said it was fine, she could go.

447
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
But—

448
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
She wanted to give you this letter.

449
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,360
You have to give this letter to—

450
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,800
No problem.

451
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Let him tell this story in a bit.

452
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,880
Let him tell it in his own way.

453
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Then you saw a "zombie" again.

454
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
It had a key hanging around its neck.

455
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,360
Then you—

456
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,880
Aba, come back.

457
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,560
You snatched that key for me.

458
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,480
Throw it over before you leave.

459
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Aba, come here.

460
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Aba went to—

461
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,240
He fought with the "zombie" for a long time.

462
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
He almost "died."

463
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
He threw the key to us.

464
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
Then the two of us left.

465
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
I just let her "die" here.

466
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,600
I wanted to save her at first.

467
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,760
But you stopped me in the end and said not to save her, it was useless.

468
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,480
What?

469
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,000
Alright, tell them this way later.

470
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Tell them like this.

471
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Let's see if they believe it.

472
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
But just now, this floor has already gathered

473
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
about thirty "zombies".

474
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,000
They're all mine.

475
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
My monster army.

476
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,880
I am the king of zombies.

477
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,840
So I stand at the back.

478
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
Just follow the zombies in.

479
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,760
You're the top zombie fighter.

480
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,080
So you have to rush in first.

481
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,600
In our zombie kingdom, you are

482
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,160
the number one general.

483
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
When people are speechless,

484
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
they really do laugh.

485
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
Come on, let me give you one.

486
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,720
A mini egg yolk sausage.

487
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
I just finished eating, thanks.

488
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Number one general,

489
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
remember your mission.

490
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,120
You can't talk to them.

491
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,200
I can't tear it open.

492
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,160
I can't open it either.

493
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,880
You can't talk to them, okay?

494
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,120
You can only growl.

495
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
Right, you can only bite them.

496
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,800
And you have to bite.

497
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
You have to bite.

498
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
If you want to act with more depth,

499
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,400
you can show that you

500
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
as a good teammate,

501
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,240
at the moment you bite them,

502
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,720
you suddenly

503
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,760
show your humanity again.

504
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
You restrain yourself and don't bite.

505
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,960
Hurry up.

506
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,360
This feeling of going back and forth.

507
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,640
Okay.

508
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,800
A very conflicted heart.

509
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,280
This whole scene depends on your performance.

510
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,880
Alright.

511
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Then I'm behind you.

512
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
I notice when you return to your human side,

513
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,080
when that side shows, I will

514
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,640
I will

515
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
What are you doing in this scene?

516
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm supervising you from behind.

517
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Are you the director?

518
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm not the director.

519
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,840
I said I'm

520
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm the king of monsters.

521
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay.

522
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,240
You're the number one monster henchman.

523
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,520
No, the two of us don't have

524
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
Physical attacks don't work on us.

525
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
We have no rules.

526
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,480
No, unless they

527
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Their rules only apply to lower-level monsters.

528
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,720
No.

529
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Unless they use humanity

530
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
to awaken this side of us,

531
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,320
Right.

532
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,080
the bond between brothers.

533
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,800
The message you need to tell them is

534
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,960
if they encounter the two of us,

535
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,720
we are advanced monsters.

536
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,240
And when they cast spells on us,

537
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,960
it can only be

538
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
The awakening of humanity

539
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,200
They need

540
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,320
to remind us with warmth and love

541
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,200
I need to see the tears in their eyes

542
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,240
Right, and then the two of us

543
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,800
will finally slow down

544
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,520
That's right

545
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah

546
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,240
We might even help them

547
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,320
hold back the zombie horde

548
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,880
Yeah

549
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Right, their bubble

550
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
is useless against us

551
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,440
Yeah

552
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,280
All they can do is cry and say

553
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,720
Wake up, it's us

554
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,600
We're your own people

555
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,240
Suddenly, we

556
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,800
Yeah

557
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,240
Right, you guys need to go

558
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah

559
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
We can't control it anymore

560
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,319
Soon, there will be a very touching scene

561
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,839
Yeah

562
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,480
Yeah

563
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,800
Right, let them hold back their tears, and then

564
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,359
Yeah

565
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,119
they leave

566
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,800
Then, thinking about it

567
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,720
the two of us still have some humanity left

568
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,440
So they quickly

569
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,960
come back to save us

570
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,920
from the lab

571
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,800
they take out the new medicine they've developed

572
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,280
Yeah

573
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah

574
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
and then they save you

575
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
And then I

576
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,640
rule over my zombie kingdom

577
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,680
You're just making this up, you know

578
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,960
How is it?

579
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,200
Let's go.

580
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,840
That's it, right?

581
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,400
Let's go.

582
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,760
Okay.

583
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,120
Isn't this the place?

584
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
They're unconscious, but haven't woken up yet.

585
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,640
Thank you for your hard work, teacher.

586
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,520
Thank you for your hard work.

587
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
Thanks for your effort.

588
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
This is Aguai's father, and this is...

589
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,840
This girl.

590
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Her back stretch is really impressive.

591
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
She's practicing something like Yijinjing.

592
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
Her shoulder blades must be very flexible.

593
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
Where did we come from?

594
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,880
Take the elevator down.

595
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,400
The elevator, right?

596
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,200
Take the elevator down.

597
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Let's go to the first floor.

598
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
The spot we're looking for.

599
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,480
Right.

600
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
Which one is the most comfortable to lie on?

601
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,680
This one.

602
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
I sometimes cross my legs like this too.

603
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
This is the one...

604
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,200
The lady with unbeatable flexibility.

605
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,960
Very impressive.

606
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
Thumbs up.

607
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
Chosen shoulder blades.

608
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,840
Really amazing.

609
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
You still want to play with this so much.

610
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

611
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,480
It's me again.

612
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,600
You're judging a gentleman with a petty mind.

613
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,040
No.

614
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
What you say is always right.

615
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
Since when have you been so obedient to me?

616
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
She's doing a stress test right now.

617
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,080
No.

618
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,040
When is she ever not like this?

619
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,000
This thing of yours is pretty impressive.

620
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,000
I got this from He’s place.

621
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,120
What is this?

622
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
This isn't one of those cameras, is it?

623
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
A pinhole camera.

624
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
He's been secretly filming me all along.

625
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,360
You've got some serious issues.

626
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,800
That's all of them.

627
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,920
The people we rescued.

628
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
The rescued people, got it.

629
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,680
Alright, okay.

630
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
Alright then, let's hurry back.

631
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,720
Let's hurry back.

632
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
Then they won't have to get rained on.

633
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Let's go quickly.

634
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,960
Let's hurry up and go.

635
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,200
Hurry.

636
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
Thanks for your hard work.

637
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,280
Hurry.

638
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
Thanks for your effort.

639
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,520
Thanks.

640
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,120
Sorry.

641
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
Why did you step on them?

642
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
No, I kicked them.

643
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,600
Hurry.

644
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
Hurry.

645
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,360
Are you tired today?

646
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm okay.

647
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,040
Alright then.

648
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm fine too.

649
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,960
We're equally tired.

650
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
But those two are a bit more tired.

651
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,400
They were panting for a long time.

652
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,160
She's tired too.

653
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,880
When she was running away today,

654
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
she used up a lot of energy.

655
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

656
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,520
Do you know how tired I am?

657
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
I lowered myself on the wire by myself.

658
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
I was holding on tightly with both hands.

659
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,200
When I got down,

660
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,480
my hands were shaking.

661
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,760
Actually, you could have let go.

662
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,200
I was too scared, I couldn't let go.

663
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
You lowered yourself on the wire by yourself?

664
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
No, she was just hanging on the wire.

665
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,360
She was lowered down.

666
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I know.

667
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,320
But as it was lowering,

668
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,440
I was holding on for dear life.

669
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah, that's what she did.

670
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,320
You were just practicing that.

671
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,840
Just practicing that.

672
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,520
Got it.

673
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
It's just anaerobic exercise.

674
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,920
She was so desperate.

675
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,840
Seriously.

676
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,600
Aren't you usually scared of hanging on wires?

677
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,760
I've never hung on wires before.

678
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,840
No wonder

679
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,800
You should have said so earlier

680
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,960
Do you know what made me feel most hopeless?

681
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
I thought it had been a really long time

682
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,960
You all told me not to be afraid

683
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
It's already a third done

684
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Who said that?

685
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,280
He said it

686
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,880
He said it

687
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,320
Actually, at that time

688
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,160
It wasn't even a third yet

689
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
It was only a fifth

690
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,960
That's right

691
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
A third done

692
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,640
No, why is there still a third left?

693
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,280
At that time, you were very strong in our eyes

694
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Welcome

695
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,280
This time, Dilraba gave me a task

696
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
Do you know what it is?

697
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
To protect you

698
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
To take care of you

699
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
She's really nice

700
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,040
Really, she's great

701
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
We just need to wake him up

702
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,560
He'll do mouth-to-mouth on his own

703
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes, that's right

704
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
The guys didn't hang out for nothing

705
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,400
You should go for her

706
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
Just pretend to go for it

707
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,880
But don't wake me up

708
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,040
How did you fall asleep like this?

709
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Three, two, one, go

710
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,800
Who are you?

711
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
These are the lines we say together

712
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,120
Wake me up first

713
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,560
I think we need to rehearse this scene

714
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,200
I used to play with sticks

715
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Monkey staff tricks

716
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,360
So you're a monkey trainer?

717
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,200
Crazy in love like me

718
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,040
How does that song go?

719
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,800
There's a singer in the back

720
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,920
Can't you ask him?

721
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,800
What?

722
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,040
When you turn around, what about the singer?

723
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,520
If the moon hasn't come yet

724
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,880
Can you take that thing off your lips?

725
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,000
Girls designed all this on purpose

726
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,920
And then like this, like this
