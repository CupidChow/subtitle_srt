1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,640
This "sword" is cool.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,400
Check this out, bro.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,200
That's a lighter.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Mine's just a plastic case, bro.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,400
This is my little pet.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,480
Is it heavy?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,920
It's a bit heavy.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,280
Can you hold it for me?

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,800
No.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,560
Touch it.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,200
It's not a big deal.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,560
No, no.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,520
What's the head?

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
What do you mean, "no"?

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
Ke, dance king, what are you dancing?

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Dance king, what are you doing, dance king?

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
We're all following you, dance king.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Hurry up and introduce yourself.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm Jin Shangbao.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Do you have any special abilities?

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
Me? I just radiate charm.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
I make others fall in love with me.

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,560
I think today's NPC teachers

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,400
if any of them try to scare us,

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,160
they'd better watch out.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
Because we all brought our "weapons" today.

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,120
Actually, everyone can

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
put their "weapons"

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,040
to the side now.

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,520
No way.

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
No way.

32
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
How could that work?

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,480
Even if it's uncomfortable, I have to keep it with me.

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,760
What do you want to do to us?

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,800
Doing those dances behind our backs.

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
It wasn't me.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,320
That was my double.

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,360
Hello.

39
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,440
What's this?

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,800
A pet.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,800
A pet.

42
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,640
Is it from the show?

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
It's He Chongchong's pet.

44
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,080
Yes, it's a herbivore.

45
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,000
It doesn't bite.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Don't run.

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,840
You can hold it by the neck, like this.

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,560
You're not afraid of this?

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm not afraid.

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,520
I raised one of these for a show before.

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
It's fine, it doesn't bite.

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,320
But when you touch it,

53
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,760
you'll feel a strange sensation.

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,920
It's pretty warm.

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes, that's normal for a cold-blooded animal.

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,360
Are you afraid of this?

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,680
Look at this.

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,600
It won't bite, right?

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
It will, it does bite.

60
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,199
Don't.

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Everyone has a "gun".

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,280
That's really nice.

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,920
You have a "sword".

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,320
I have one here too.

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,720
A "sword".

66
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Can it be drawn out?

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes, it can.

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,880
But it's very tight.

69
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,600
He sealed it on purpose, really tight.

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,480
This "sword" is cool.

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,120
Check out mine.

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
That's a lighter.

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Mine's just a plastic case, man.

74
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
You all have pretty complete gear.

75
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
He has both a "sword" and a "gun".

76
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm the only one with just this.

77
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
This isn't real too, is it?

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,320
Why is your "sword" so low quality?

79
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,680
You call this low quality?

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Look at someone else's "sword".

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
This one's made of iron.

82
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
It's real, try pulling it out.

83
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
Then why is mine like this?

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Yours is (cartoon).

85
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,680
This one's pretty good.

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
Your outfit is from that...

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
That Dragon Quest one.

88
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Really.

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,520
This is cool, this one.

90
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
What's so cool about it?

91
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,000
Looks like Napoleon.

92
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
You look so cool.

93
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,760
Aren't you afraid of this?

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,040
It's fine, it won't bite.

95
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,280
What should I do?

96
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
What's this? Whose is it?

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Hold it like this.

98
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
Hold the back like this, grab this part.

99
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
It's fine, just hold it like this.

100
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Hurry, give it to Jin Jing.

101
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,400
She likes it.

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,000
A bit more handsome.

103
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,040
Walk from the side door to the main entrance.

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Walk in a cool way.

105
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,840
So cool.

106
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,560
So cool.

107
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,040
Bro, do you have pneumothorax?

108
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,680
I have pneumothorax.

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
And I've had several surgeries.

110
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,760
I won't say anything about you anymore.

111
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
One, two, three, four, five.

112
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,320
I have it too.

113
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
I've had five surgeries.

114
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Six times.

115
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,800
Really?

116
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah, six times in total.

117
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,040
I saw in that report

118
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,520
It said a lot of celebrities have it too.

119
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
You were mentioned in it.

120
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,760
I was there.

121
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
I'll find you a chair.

122
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,160
I won't let you get tired anymore.

123
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
It's fine, no worries.

124
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Today I'm going to pound his chest.

125
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Do you have it too?

126
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
Yes, I do.

127
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
Why does it happen?

128
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
Pneumothorax usually happens to tall, thin people.

129
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
Yes, to thin people.

130
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,200
Your internal organs

131
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
aren't as well developed or robust.

132
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
They're relatively thin.

133
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,520
It's hard to say.

134
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
Yeah, it's hard to say.

135
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
How the lung bulla suddenly bursts,

136
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,320
and air gets in.

137
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,240
But what's really dramatic is—

138
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,600
What's really dramatic about it?

139
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,640
When you get pneumothorax,

140
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,120
it's like air gets in

141
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,640
and compresses your whole lung.

142
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Then if you move, it can rupture.

143
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it because you're thin?

144
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
Yes, thin people are more likely to get it.

145
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,960
It's just that your development

146
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
isn't as robust as others.

147
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,320
So it's easier to get.

148
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
Is it too late to gain weight now?

149
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,160
It's too late.

150
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
So if you exercise too much now,

151
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,920
will anything happen?

152
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,400
It's fine.

153
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,920
Like singing and stuff,

154
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,640
it's fine.

155
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
You had it when you were little, right?

156
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Yeah, pneumothorax.

157
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,720
It's not like exerting yourself will definitely trigger it.

158
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
It's actually just a sudden force.

159
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
I won't say anything to you anymore.

160
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,880
It's okay, you can say it.

161
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
I won't say it, I feel bad for you.

162
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
I was stunned when I saw your name.

163
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
I almost cried.

164
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Really.

165
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Are there chairs at the venue?

166
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,400
I'm falling apart.

167
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,360
Really.

168
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Hello, everyone.

169
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,000
Hi.

170
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
Long time no see, I missed you so much.

171
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,680
You look great.

172
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Thank you, we both look great.

173
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm a bit less good-looking than you.

174
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Your contacts look really cool today.

175
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,200
That's nice.

176
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,840
Are you guys wearing wigs?

177
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Wig.

178
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,400
Is this one too?

179
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
It's real hair. I was actually thinking...

180
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
The back is a wig.

181
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,880
The back is a wig.

182
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,360
The front is my own hair.

183
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920
I was planning to wear a wig.

184
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
But then I thought about it.

185
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,240
It would be uncomfortable to wear it all day.

186
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
So I ended up not wearing it.

187
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,520
Yeah.

188
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
This is enough.

189
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Yeah, I was going for that Caribbean style.

190
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,200
Wouldn't that clash with hers?

191
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,960
Hers is red.

192
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,280
But mine is just the regular one.

193
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,640
Yeah.

194
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,480
You're not planning to carry it around all day, are you?

195
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
No, I'll put it away in a bit.

196
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
We look like bandits.

197
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,200
This path is a bit rough.

198
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
Where are we going?

199
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
I don't know either.

200
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
It's a beautiful, sunny day.

201
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
There's a light drizzle.

202
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,320
And there's fog.

203
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
There's a bit of mist, too.

204
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
So, the two of us are...

205
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Just guarding the door.

206
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,760
We're the doorkeepers.

207
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,680
We really do look like doorkeepers.

208
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Kind of.

209
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Where's your invitation?

210
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,120
My invitation is in my pocket.

211
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,240
How about it?

212
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't.

213
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,080
Stop.

214
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,720
Try it.

215
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,880
No, I'm really scared of this.

216
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,320
Just try it.

217
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
This is my little pet.

218
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,680
It's warm, right?

219
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,800
No way.

220
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,640
It feels like a snake.

221
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't move.

222
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,920
Is it heavy?

223
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,760
Not really.

224
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,280
It's a bit heavy, help me hold it.

225
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,760
Don't.

226
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,920
Touch it.

227
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Give it a stroke.

228
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,240
No, I feel a bit...

229
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,800
Just stroke it.

230
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
It feels a bit strange.

231
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
Touch

232
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
Touch, come here

233
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
I've already touched it

234
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,280
Touch like this

235
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, touch it

236
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Don't

237
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,720
That's enough

238
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Where's our friend?

239
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,360
Who's next?

240
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,640
The next one is coming

241
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
I want to put my pet on him

242
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,800
But where to?

243
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,960
Walk along the stone path

244
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
Where people walk, a path is made

245
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Went the wrong way

246
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
Went the wrong way

247
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,280
So annoying

248
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
What a beautiful place

249
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
There are two handsome guys

250
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
Your "lover"

251
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,040
I don't know her

252
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,400
I don't know her

253
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,440
Who goes there?

254
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
Who am I?

255
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
I am the most beautiful woman in the world

256
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,720
Respond

257
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
I can't respond

258
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,640
After filming variety shows for so long, just one line

259
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,360
Here comes another one

260
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,640
This is the most beautiful woman in the world

261
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,680
So beautiful, so fragrant

262
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,720
Red hair

263
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
She hasn't even arrived yet

264
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,520
And you can already smell her fairy-like scent

265
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,600
And you can already smell her fairy-like scent

266
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,240
Want to take the "gun"

267
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,960
Want to take the "gun"

268
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,280
I admit it.

269
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
Hello, everyone.

270
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
Hello.

271
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,640
Who are you?

272
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Hello, everyone.

273
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,919
This is real.

274
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,360
This is real.

275
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,840
Yes.

276
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Give it a touch.

277
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,880
You're really brave.

278
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,360
Look at the others.

279
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
Hello, everyone. My name is

280
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,400
Ba Jiaoshan.

281
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Ba Jiaoshan.

282
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
I am a folk singer.

283
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,520
And I am twenty-three years old this year.

284
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,640
I am very proud and also very kind.

285
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
Wait, it’s not on.

286
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,880
Fake blowing—your mouth hasn’t even touched it yet.

287
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
Did you blow this?

288
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,320
It can make a different sound every time.

289
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Why isn’t there a cow sound?

290
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,920
There is a cow sound.

291
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,160
This one.

292
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,080
You do a cow sound.

293
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,640
They’re calling you.

294
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,000
They’re calling you.

295
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm calling you.

296
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Hello, handsome.

297
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,200
Come over and join us.

298
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Brother.

299
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,800
They're all beautiful women.

300
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
All beautiful women.

301
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,360
Okay.

302
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
There are both Chinese and Western beauties.

303
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,440
I forgot to introduce myself.

304
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,160
Wait a moment, let me introduce myself first.

305
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
Hurry up, introduce yourself.

306
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
I am...

307
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm Jin Shangbao.

308
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,200
Because I'm too beautiful,

309
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,960
I've threatened Ba Jiaoshan's position.

310
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,480
Now she's holding me at gunpoint.

311
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you have any special abilities?

312
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,240
I just radiate charm.

313
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
And make others fall in love with me.

314
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,440
That's real.

315
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,920
Yes.

316
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
That's my character setting.

317
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,480
Introduce yourself.

318
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,680
Hello everyone, I am...

319
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
After drawing on white paper, I draw on black paper.

320
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,200
After drawing on black paper, I draw on white paper again.

321
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm a rising artist.

322
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,160
Hello everyone, no matter how many difficulties I face,

323
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm He Chongchong, who insists on raising pet bugs.

324
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,880
This is my pet, Chongchong.

325
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait.

326
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,280
Don't.

327
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,600
Here comes another handsome guy.

328
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Hello, everyone.

329
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
This distinguished gentleman.

330
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,480
Hello.

331
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,440
What do you mean by "distinguished gentleman"?

332
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
He's a really distinguished older brother.

333
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Right?

334
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,360
Right.

335
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,040
Okay.

336
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,960
Is your beard real?

337
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:44,840
Yes.

338
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,280
Come on, distinguished gentleman, stand here.

339
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,040
We're going to "execute" you.

340
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,960
You want me to stand in the center, right?

341
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,440
Yes.

342
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
A real beard.

343
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,240
Yes.

344
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,160
Tell us who you are.

345
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
You want me to introduce myself?

346
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,840
Yes.

347
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,400
Introduce yourself.

348
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,840
You guys are done being awkward, right?

349
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Yes, the awkwardness is over.

350
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
We're not awkward at all.

351
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
Yes, we're doing great.

352
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,600
Everyone is gradually finding their place.

353
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,320
You think you're the only one who has it?

354
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,680
Put the "gun" down.

355
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,520
There was just a sound.

356
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
Everyone is up so early.

357
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,720
Okay.

358
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
It's only five thirty.

359
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Everyone is already up.

360
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,640
That's great.

361
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm Tui Houlang.

362
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm the manager of this residence.

363
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,360
Alright.

364
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,920
So,

365
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,200
in order for everyone

366
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,720
to get a better impression of each other,

367
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,000
let's do a simple self-introduction again.

368
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,800
How about it?

369
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,240
Sure.

370
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
Let's start with my staff member, Ning Reception.

371
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,800
Go ahead.

372
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,280
No problem.

373
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,440
He's your staff member?

374
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,720
Yes.

375
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
You look more like the staff member.

376
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,400
Like this.

377
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,520
I have a small suggestion.

378
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,200
The space is a bit cramped.

379
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Let's just stay under this roof.

380
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,840
Let's not go outside, okay?

381
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
It's drizzling outside.

382
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Ning, come over.

383
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,520
Come over here.

384
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,880
Let's stand in a line, okay?

385
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
You're wearing press-on nails.

386
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,760
You're so trendy.

387
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,080
Those are real nail extensions.

388
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,520
No, I'll take them off later and stick them on you.

389
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,680
Standing between you tall people,

390
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
I look...

391
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
I don't have any lifts.

392
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,600
No.

393
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,760
What is it?

394
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,200
Does it change color?

395
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
No, it's just a regular one.

396
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,400
It closed its eyes.

397
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
It can't listen anymore.

398
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,520
Wake up, time to work.

399
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,960
What does it usually eat?

400
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,720
It usually eats grass.

401
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,160
Just like you.

402
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,840
Like me?

403
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
It usually eats grass.

404
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
Should we put the little pet bug...

405
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
I'll put it in the box first.

406
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,560
Okay.

407
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,600
Stay there.

408
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,160
What's wrong?

409
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
Why are you suddenly looking at me?

410
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,720
It's nothing.

411
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
What's the matter?

412
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,680
Do you have something you want to say to me?

413
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Just say it.

414
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,920
I think you're nice.

415
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,960
You seem like an old friend.

416
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
Shall we get ready to start?

417
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Okay.

418
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,600
So, to make it easier for me to demonstrate,

419
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,440
everyone, please move a little over there.

420
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,600
Such a big move?

421
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
What, are you going to show a big move?

422
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,400
You're not going to dress as a woman, are you?

423
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
It's very simple.

424
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,240
Everyone, watch closely.

425
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
Five, six, seven, go!

426
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

427
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,240
Pirate Mansion welcomes you.

428
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,120
Don't give up, don't give up.

429
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,960
San Niang's treasure is in the sea.

430
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Don't be delicate, don't be delicate.

431
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
No cheating during the ceremony.

432
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,800
No cheating during the ceremony.

433
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,880
Don't sigh, don't sigh.

434
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,080
If you persist to the end, miracles can happen.

435
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,560
This is Bajiaoshan's favorite thing.

436
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,640
Awkward.

437
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
How is everyone doing?

438
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Okay, I'll lead everyone from the front.

439
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,920
Let's do it again.

440
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,080
Come on, everyone.

441
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,560
Come on.

442
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Here.

443
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,200
How are you here? You ran all the way over there.

444
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,120
You were just standing in the middle, come quickly.

445
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
Here.

446
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
You stand in the middle.

447
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,120
Step a bit forward.

448
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,040
I don't have any space left.

449
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,480
Go for it.

450
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,040
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

451
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,680
Pirate Mansion welcomes you.

452
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't give up, don't give up.

453
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,880
San Niang's treasure is in the sea.

454
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,360
Don't be delicate, don't be delicate.

455
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,880
No cheating during the ceremony.

456
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,320
Don't sigh, don't sigh.

457
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
If you persist to the end, miracles can happen.

458
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
Last little pose.

459
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
How is it?

460
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,200
Perfect.

461
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,080
I'm sure everyone has learned it.

462
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,720
Come on, everyone, let's do it once.

463
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
Let me take a look.

464
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,680
I can't memorize it at all, what should I do?

465
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,360
It's okay, we have the dance king here.

466
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,880
With the dance king here,

467
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
it's not a big deal.

468
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,800
Come on.

469
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,520
Let's go.

470
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,080
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

471
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
What? What?

472
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,200
No.

473
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,440
No.

474
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
San Niang's treasure

475
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
is in the sea.

476
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,160
No.

477
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,440
No.

478
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,120
What, what, what, no!

479
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,280
If you persist to the end, miracles can happen.

480
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,720
The last little pose.

481
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,080
Hey dance king, what are you dancing?

482
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
Dance king, what are you doing? Dance king!

483
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
We're all following you, dance king.

484
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,760
Very good.

485
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,080
Treasure appreciation.

486
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,120
What do you think of the four boys' dancing?

487
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
I didn't see clearly.

488
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,880
I want them to dance one by one.

489
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,720
Did you forget about me?

490
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,160
He doesn't have to dance unless it's for free.

491
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,040
Why?

492
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,560
I won't let you get tired again.

493
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,200
It's okay.

494
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Because he has a pneumothorax.

495
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,400
I saw it in the news.

496
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
When I came across it, I started crying.

497
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,920
My good brother.

498
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,480
So he wasn't slacking off on the show.

499
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,200
He just isn't in good health.

500
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
If anyone calls him lazy again, they'll have to deal with me.

501
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
But I was the one who said it the most.

502
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,160
That's why I think he dances the best.

503
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
He doesn't have to dance anymore.

504
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,200
But...

505
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,240
The remaining three.

506
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Give me a good group dance.

507
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,360
Okay.

508
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,680
We'll listen to you today, alright?

509
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,840
We'll do as you say, come on.

510
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,000
Come on.

511
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,080
Five, six, seven, go!

512
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

513
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,760
Pirate Mansion welcomes you.

514
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,120
Don't give up, don't give up.

515
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
San Niang's treasure.

516
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
Is in the sea.

517
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,720
Don't be delicate, don't be delicate.

518
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,040
No cheating during the ceremony.

519
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,280
Don't sigh, don't sigh.

520
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,360
If you persist to the end, miracles will happen.

521
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
There are miracles.

522
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,920
Dance King, you really are...

523
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,360
You...

524
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,200
Really good.

525
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Really good.

526
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,560
Really good.

527
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Really good.

528
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,040
Really bad.

529
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,520
I want to ask Tui Sanlang something.

530
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,560
Why did you choose

531
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,080
They're called

532
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
Tui Houlang.

533
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,720
Tui Sanlang.

534
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
His ancestor was called

535
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,480
Tui Sanniang.

536
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
How did you end up choosing us?

537
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,560
How did I end up choosing you?

538
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,160
Right.

539
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,480
It's all about good looks.

540
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Ranking by appearance.

541
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
Ba Jiaoshan.

542
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Of the four men today, who do you think

543
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,480
is the best?

544
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,760
I think you're the best.

545
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm just average.

546
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,400
I really am just average.

547
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,800
You really are just average.

548
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,920
I really am just average.

549
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,480
That's the truth.

550
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Okay.

551
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Everyone, follow me.

552
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay.

553
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,280
Let's go.

554
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,280
Come on.

555
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,760
Come on.

556
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
Watch your step, it's a bit slippery.

557
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,560
Alright.

558
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,400
Just tell me, is it scary or not?

559
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,360
I think

560
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,640
today's NPC teachers

561
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,480
if any of them try to scare us,

562
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,160
they'd better be careful.

563
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Because we all came with "weapons."

564
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Why does it smell like roasted sweet potatoes?

565
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,520
It really does.

566
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Yeah, it does.

567
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
The first exhibit is roasted sweet potatoes.

568
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,880
Roasted sweet potatoes.

569
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,960
Roasting around the stove.

570
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,520
It's called stove-side tea roasting.

571
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,880
That's what I said.

572
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
Brewing tea by the stove.

573
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,760
Brewing tea.

574
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Roasting tea.

575
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,240
It's really cozy.

576
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
Come on.

577
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Bro, sit in the middle, bro.

578
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,720
You two sit here.

579
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
My sword is too complicated.

580
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll sit on the edge.

581
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,840
Like this.

582
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,680
Actually, everyone can put their weapons

583
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,440
down beside them.

584
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,000
No way.

585
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,520
That's not okay.

586
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
Would that work?

587
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,080
Even if it's uncomfortable, I have to keep it with me.

588
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,680
What are you planning to do to us?

589
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
It's nothing.

590
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,480
Support the younger generation

591
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,440
I want to make a complaint

592
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
Your reception here

593
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
burned all the peanuts you roasted for us

594
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
and that orange is burnt too

595
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,680
and you even said it was on purpose

596
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,240
No, it's crispy outside and tender inside

597
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,000
Even after Bajiaoshan pointed it out

598
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,680
you said I did it on purpose

599
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,200
Why did you roast every single one like this?

600
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
That's exactly how I wanted them

601
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,200
From a scientific perspective

602
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
the outside is supposed to be like this

603
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,240
It all tastes burnt, and you call that scientific?

604
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
Just take all of these out

605
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
That one is roasted really well

606
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,920
That sweet potato

607
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,640
Do you want to eat it?

608
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,440
I’m not eating it right now

609
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
But this should taste really good

610
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
It's hot

611
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,440
It's fine

612
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
It's a bit hot

613
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,880
Is this how you eat it?

614
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,560
Yes

615
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Yes

616
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,160
Is it roasted in sections?

617
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Don’t eat the whole thing

618
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Can’t you eat it piece by piece?

619
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,520
No

620
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
It has a different flavor, right?

621
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,080
Smoky flavor

622
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,440
Smoked orange

623
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,160
It’s like drinking orange soup

624
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,680
Right

625
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,760
That’s what smoky flavor is like

626
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
It's exactly six o'clock now.

627
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
It's six o'clock.

628
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,000
The ceremony officially begins.

629
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,640
The first person, please go in.

630
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
"Weapons."

631
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,200
Put them down.

632
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Your show has finished airing.

633
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,240
Yeah.

634
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,320
What do you mean?

635
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:41,720
Nothing.

636
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,560
I want to ask him how it feels to kiss so many times.

637
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm used to it.

638
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm used to it.

639
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
I wish I had that habit too.

640
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
I've never filmed a kissing scene.

641
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,880
I haven't.

642
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,800
I've never taken a kissing scene before.

643
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
Do you want to?

644
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
Act it out with me.

645
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,680
You two add a scene for me here today.

646
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
Let you experience it.

647
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
I can add a scene for everyone.

648
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Of course, you two are the closest.

649
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,280
He's easy to talk to.

650
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,240
We might not agree.

651
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,520
Listen to the sounds inside.

652
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,280
It's very quiet.

653
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I don't think he'll make any sound.

654
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
My heart is already racing.

655
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,640
No.

656
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,600
No.

657
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,160
You respond to everything.

658
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,480
I said my heart is already racing.

659
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,360
You said no.

660
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,920
I meant it won't be scary inside.

661
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,120
That's what I meant.

662
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,400
How do you know it won't be scary?

663
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,240
How do you know it won't be scary?

664
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Are you scared? Did you ask about it?

665
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,520
No.

666
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
There must be something inside.

667
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,480
Yeah, there must be something.

668
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Or the ground shakes.

669
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
That's it.

670
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
I don't think it's that high-tech.

671
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,400
Not necessarily.

672
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
Last time there was even a big swimming pool.

673
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,000
Last time.

674
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't think it's that high-tech.

675
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,920
It just means it's probably a bit dark inside.

676
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,600
Let me tell you.

677
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,520
Be careful.

678
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
When you go in later,

679
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,360
ten sets of armor might fall out.

680
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,920
As soon as you come out,

681
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,960
it's really scary.

682
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,080
All your nail polish will be gone.

683
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,920
Something like a "murder" happened inside.

684
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,960
This could be a clue.

685
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,440
Very likely.

686
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,680
Key prop

687
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,240
Are you hiding poison in your nail?

688
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,840
If you put it that way,

689
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,720
I'll take it off right now.

690
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,840
I can take it off immediately.

691
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,120
Can you give me a thumb?

692
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,280
I want one too.

693
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,040
Sure.

694
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,200
This can be removed instantly, right?

695
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,120
It's just glue.

696
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
Does it still stick?

697
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Yes, it does.

698
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
Your nail is so big.

699
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,520
That's so strange.

700
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,760
It fits well.

701
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,240
It actually looks pretty good.

702
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,560
It's fine.

703
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,960
The nail Liu Yuning gave me.

704
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,720
Okay.

705
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,200
Alright.

706
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Which one is official, teacher?

707
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,120
I don't want to be in the same photo as her.

708
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,680
I can't appear in the same photo as her.

709
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,400
I was just about to say, it feels a bit out of place.

710
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
She's not following me around every day.

711
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
When she brings me soup.

712
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
Make us look like twin sisters in the photo.

713
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,560
If we don't look alike, it's your responsibility.

714
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,800
My legal team will come after you.

715
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,040
It's fine.

716
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,560
He'll give it to you later.

717
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,000
He'll duplicate her face for you.

718
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,600
There are so many jokes.

719
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,400
This is so long.

720
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,080
Even he walks this far.

721
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,760
Yeah.

722
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
It's been fifteen minutes, as I said.

723
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,320
Maybe he's committing a crime in there.

724
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
He's always this slow.

725
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, that's a problem.

726
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,800
Oh no, another one of my nails came off.

727
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,680
It fell off again.

728
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Stop using the lamp, stop working.

729
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,800
Cure the glue with the lamp before sticking it back on.

730
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,120
It might catch fire in a bit.

731
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,840
It won't.

732
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
Do you want nail polish?

733
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,160
I can give it to you during the break.

734
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,240
Just apply it directly, right?

735
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:35,880
This one.

736
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,160
This kind.

737
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,840
It's pretty.

738
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,720
I want to put it on.

739
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,200
Give it to me.

740
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Okay.

741
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,320
Is it easy to remove?

742
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,160
It's just nail polish.

743
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,720
Get the nail polish remover when you go back.

744
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,400
Alright.

745
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,520
Give it to me, don't give it to him.

746
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
The lamp is making me sleepy.

747
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,200
First, it can make your face oily.

748
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Second, it can make you sleepy.

749
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,400
Could it really be...

750
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
...everyone's time of committing the act?

751
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,360
It's possible.

752
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Draw on white paper.

753
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,920
Draw on white paper.

754
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,000
But we don't have a clock.

755
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,080
How do you calculate the time then?

756
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,200
Your lips are so red.

757
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Why are they so red?

758
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
What turned red?

759
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,600
His lips are really red.

760
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,560
He's young, born in the 2000s.

761
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,000
Think about it.

762
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,040
It's normal to have a bit of color.

763
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Wait, let me check if it's lipstick.

764
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,520
What are you doing?

765
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,240
She's listening.

766
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,040
She's performing.

767
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
You look prettier from a distance.

768
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,200
What do you mean?

769
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Do I not look good up close?

770
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680
No, you just look more three-dimensional from afar.

771
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,240
You can go in now.

772
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,160
I...

773
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm going in.

774
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,840
It's my turn. Bye.

775
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,440
Bye.

776
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,040
Good luck.

777
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I just want to see if her nose ring is still there.

778
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
That's it.

779
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
Pulling noses, letting people pull noses.

780
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
You're the third one, right?

781
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,920
Yeah.

782
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Are you ready?

783
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,360
Is there anything you want to say to me?

784
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
What if there's a kissing scene inside?

785
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm going now.

786
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,200
You two are really too much.

787
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,280
Do you think bringing this "weapon" in

788
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,880
will be useful?

789
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,280
But it could be the tool used in the crime.

790
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
The real culprit

791
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
might have hidden the "weapon" in their clothes.

792
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,120
That's right.

793
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,080
What do you mean?

794
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,600
You mean today's key clue

795
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,360
is in the clothes?

796
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,640
Yes.

797
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,520
Then should we all take off our clothes?

798
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,680
Wait a second.

799
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,400
When people are most scared,

800
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,440
the three most helpless words they say are

801
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,360
Who would wait for you?

802
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,440
Yeah.

803
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,160
If you can't catch up, that's it.

804
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,560
That's right.

805
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,920
Do you have any alcohol?

806
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,520
Tell me your story.

807
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,800
I can't breathe.

808
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,680
My collar is too tight.

809
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,880
Take off the collar.

810
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
It's your waist that's too tight.

811
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,280
My waist is just this slim, it's not tight.

812
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,320
If you don't believe me, come measure it.

813
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,800
Are you afraid of me?

814
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,720
Why are you so afraid of me?

815
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of you.

816
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,080
Then sit a little closer.

817
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,200
He doesn't even dare look you in the eye.

818
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
He's afraid he'll fall for you in an instant.

819
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
No.

820
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,640
Do you know this feeling?

821
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,320
It's easy to fall for someone.

822
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,480
When you look at someone like that,

823
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,000
I know.

824
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,600
It's very charming.

825
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,960
You really made me laugh.

826
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,040
We have the same kind of eyes.

827
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,320
Both of us have those charming eyes.

828
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,040
She can't keep up with your conversation.

829
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,800
No.

830
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,640
This is my usual way of chatting with him.

831
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,080
What do you know?

832
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,760
She did it on purpose.

833
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
That's how she is with me.

834
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,720
Because I'm more of the aggressive type.

835
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,480
She needs to hold back a little.

836
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,680
You two are like this—

837
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,360
Reserved.

838
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,080
She needs to let go.

839
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,680
Right.

840
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
It's like acting together.

841
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,800
You get it?

842
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,560
It's like dancing.

843
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,120
There's a lot of skill involved.

844
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,400
Inside, people are screaming.

845
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
We're laughing out loud over here.

846
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,840
You'll be the one crying soon.

847
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,480
Still laughing?

848
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,080
You have experience filming kiss scenes.

849
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,160
Teach me.

850
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,560
How do you create so much chemistry on the spot?

851
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,160
After we wrap up.

852
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,760
Teach me after work.

853
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm so nervous.

854
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
This show dares to talk about anything.

855
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,880
You guys really are—

856
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,040
Mainly because of those two.

857
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,000
Did you watch those clips of him?

858
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Yeah, I watched them.

859
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,320
Are you jealous?

860
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I am.

861
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Other people film kissing scenes too, what's there to be jealous of?

862
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,320
Not as many as you, though.

863
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,680
Do you know what I said to him?

864
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,200
I said, "Your sister is really worried about you."

865
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,680
You kiss so much every day.

866
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,040
It does seem like a lot.

867
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,520
If he's filming a modern drama like this,

868
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,600
there are definitely going to be a lot of kissing scenes in romance dramas.

869
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,200
Really.

870
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,960
I don't know.

871
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
Don't you kiss when you're in a relationship?

872
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,760
I don't know.

873
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
I've only acted in modern skits.

874
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm really curious.

875
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,120
When you act in these romance scenes,

876
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,280
what's your mental process?

877
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,720
Do you have to fall in love with the other person?

878
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,960
You fell in love with them?

879
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Now I'm upset.

880
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
Do you forget about it after filming?

881
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,320
I can get in and out of character anytime.

882
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,280
That makes me feel better.

883
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Are you talking about love, or...

884
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,400
Do you just need to bring up certain emotions?

885
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,040
Which emotions do you use?

886
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,280
Happy ones, or sad ones?

887
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,840
Tears.

888
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,760
Tears.

889
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
When you need to cry,

890
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,960
how do you do it?

891
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah, how do you make yourself cry?

892
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,880
All kinds of methods.

893
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Eye drops and tear sticks.

894
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
I used to have no problem at all.

895
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,720
But you know,

896
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,280
there will be a moment

897
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
when you get completely stuck.

898
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,640
It happens, it really does.

899
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,680
I got stuck that night.

900
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,120
I was stuck on set for forty minutes.

901
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,320
Before, I could just keep my eyes open.

902
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,000
And then wait until

903
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
some natural tears would come out.

904
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,920
That would trigger the emotional part.

905
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,040
But that night,

906
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,120
I stared so hard my eyes almost popped out.

907
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,000
But nothing happened.

908
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,600
I felt so helpless.

909
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Later, I realized

910
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,080
it was because that night

911
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,280
I hadn't drunk any water at all.

912
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,640
Plus, I had four or five heat packs on me.

913
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,720
They dried me out completely.

914
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,680
Go ahead.

915
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Sorry, I can't record that.

916
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,600
Because right now we're having some

917
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,760
artistic discussions.

918
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,600
Okay, stop.

919
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,200
Let her go in first.

920
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,880
Alright, come on.

921
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,280
No.

922
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,440
I have to.

923
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,240
Because discussions about art and career

924
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,440
are the most important things to me.

925
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,640
So I can skip recording this part for now.

926
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
You can do that?

927
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,440
Then you go back.

928
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,640
That's too scary.

929
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,440
Go ahead.

930
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:07,920
Good luck.

931
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I really can't handle it.

932
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,960
You have to be careful.

933
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,680
Good luck.

934
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,120
It's okay.

935
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm going.

936
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,160
If it's really scary inside,

937
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,600
just scream and we'll know.

938
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,080
Listen to her voice.

939
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,800
She should be pretty brave, right?

940
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,560
Her.

941
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,280
She can't do it.

942
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,680
She can't, she really can't.

943
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,280
She's very timid.

944
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,760
She's even more timid than Ba.

945
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
Ba would

946
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,000
Ba would tough it out.

947
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
No, she's just pretending to be tough.

948
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,160
She uses that kind of anger

949
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,720
to get rid of her fear.

950
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,280
Just come on.

951
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,520
"Kill" me.

952
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,960
I'll fight you.

953
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,960
Why does she look so happy?

954
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah, she seems really excited.

955
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,040
Is it because that "ghost" is handsome?

956
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
The "ghost" is handsome, right?

957
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,760
I think so too.

958
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,000
It's like a "vampire" type.

959
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,480
The Western kind.

960
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,320
Wearing colored contact lenses.

961
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,520
I really can't stand this.

962
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,280
They must have run into him.

963
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,560
Don't move.

964
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,440
It seems she ran into Ba.

965
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,080
She said, "Don't touch me."

966
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,200
She loves roasted sweet potatoes so much.

967
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,280
Try it, it's actually pretty good.

968
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I can smell it, it smells great.

969
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,040
But my hands aren't free.

970
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,120
This sweet potato is roasted well.

971
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
It's sizzling and oozing oil.

972
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,320
That's not oil.

973
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,480
That should be the sugar.

974
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,480
It's very high in sugar.

975
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,840
So...

976
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,160
Why won't the door open?

977
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,080
Look at the two of them now.

978
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,400
They're together right now.

979
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,800
You can hear both of their voices.

980
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
The three of us are a bit nervous.

981
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
Are you the culprit?

982
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,320
You can take a wild guess who it is today.

983
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,280
It's not me.

984
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,960
I think he's the most likely.

985
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,560
Why?

986
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,440
Because he's an employee here.

987
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,680
No way, man.

988
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,760
Ba Jiaoshan is also an employee here.

989
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,880
She isn't.

990
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,320
She is.

991
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,200
She's a resident singer here.

992
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
Resident singer.

993
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Then she's invited.

994
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,280
Maybe you're being exploited by the boss.

995
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,160
Are you the butler type?

996
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I mean, all year round.

997
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,240
I just handle reception, all year round.

998
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,280
Yeah, exploited by the boss all year round.

999
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,320
But let me tell you,

1000
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,440
My story hasn't come out yet.

1001
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,280
Don't guess yet.

1002
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,800
There's a movie called "And Then There Were None."

1003
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,480
Have you seen it?

1004
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:08,720
Maybe.

1005
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
It's about a host.

1006
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,920
He invites a lot of people over.

1007
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,600
But actually, to the people he invited,

1008
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,280
he's wronged every single one of them.

1009
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,320
And in the end, the host

1010
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,760
gets killed by the people he invited.

1011
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,520
It's always like this.

1012
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,480
A lot of Detective Conan episodes are like this.

1013
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,440
What's this?

1014
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,200
Taro.

1015
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
You must be really hungry.

1016
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,120
This isn't as tasty as sweet potato.

1017
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Try it.

1018
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,200
I didn't have breakfast.

1019
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,640
I haven't eaten.

1020
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,320
Time to eat, it's mealtime.

1021
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,320
That's a bit much.

1022
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,960
And why is she already over there?

1023
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,480
She should go in and turn right, right?

1024
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,000
Are you scared?

1025
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,280
Of course.

1026
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,040
Just right now.

1027
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,400
There's no point in being scared ahead of time.

1028
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
He has a passive skill.

1029
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
He just said, "I have a passive skill."

1030
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,040
When he's acting alone,

1031
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,000
his courage increases.

1032
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,160
But when we're all together,

1033
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,680
like when Bai is here,

1034
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,200
when he has someone to rely on,

1035
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,920
he gets scared.

1036
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,080
Yeah, he allows himself to be scared.

1037
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,520
But when he has to face things alone,

1038
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,640
in this cruel world,

1039
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,680
his adrenaline kicks in.

1040
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,480
I might just pee myself.

1041
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,200
Honestly, I want to go to the bathroom right now.

1042
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,920
Remember last time,

1043
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,320
he went in there by himself.

1044
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,120
That door.

1045
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,000
You went alone in the end.

1046
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,720
That one was okay, actually.

1047
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
But it's different when you're alone.

1048
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,280
I knew there were no NPCs in that one.

1049
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,840
I'm really scared someone will suddenly jump out.

1050
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,920
That's what I'm afraid of.

1051
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,480
If I know there won't be anyone inside,

1052
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,720
then I feel a bit better.

1053
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
But the way they screamed...

1054
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,920
Someone must have interacted with you two.

1055
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:30,800
Yeah.

1056
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,200
No, don't.

1057
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,840
Because I said it.

1058
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,680
I think her scream was out of real fear.

1059
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,720
It doesn't really sound like the killer.

1060
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Like someone actually committing the crime.

1061
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,960
No, not at this point.

1062
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,280
Actually, if it were the killer,

1063
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,880
they might not be committing the crime right now.

1064
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,040
Maybe at the end, when things turn around,

1065
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,080
she could be faking all of this.

1066
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,640
It could be the same, actually.

1067
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,360
From a dramatic logic perspective,

1068
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,120
it all makes sense.

1069
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,040
Is this a chase?

1070
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
That's way too miserable, the way they're screaming.

1071
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
They're screaming so miserably.

1072
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
This is a chase.

1073
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
This segment could be an entire episode.

1074
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,200
Don't move.

1075
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,600
Don't move.

1076
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
Don't move, they're definitely being chased.

1077
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,240
Why are they singing folk songs now?

1078
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,920
They're trying to boost their courage.

1079
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,520
In this darkness

1080
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,920
I wrote an original song

1081
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,840
It's kind of like, for example

1082
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,200
Let me give an example

1083
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,520
This show switches like this

1084
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,680
They're yelling over there

1085
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm warning you all

1086
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
We're over there

1087
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,440
We're roasting tea over there, very relaxed

1088
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,160
And over there

1089
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,760
Here we're eating roasted sweet potatoes

1090
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,240
Laughing so hard

1091
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,120
Alright, I'm leaving

1092
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Careful, watch your fingernail, bro

1093
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,280
It'll definitely be gone when it comes out

1094
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,120
Did you put away the "gun" in your hand?

1095
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,800
He's very brave

1096
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,480
Your shoes are pretty cool

1097
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,600
Dance kings wear shoes like these

1098
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,280
Breakdance king

1099
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,560
The 1980s

1100
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,400
This segment

1101
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
Feels like sitting on pins and needles

1102
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
The first one to go in must feel like sitting on pins and needles

1103
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,360
How could that be

1104
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,240
We've been here for ages

1105
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,960
This round is tough.

1106
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,640
Also,

1107
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,720
I feel like today’s culprit

1108
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,800
must be someone really skilled.

1109
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,440
If there’s a blind bet round,

1110
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,840
I’d bet on Jin.

1111
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,280
Jin, right?

1112
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,560
Ning and Bai.

1113
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,080
Bai, I don’t think it’s possible this round.

1114
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
It definitely can’t be him.

1115
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,400
Not necessarily.

1116
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,360
What if a different card comes up?

1117
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,520
Besides, it’s easy to spot Bai as the culprit.

1118
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,040
Why?

1119
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,800
He’s pretty hyped up today.

1120
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,760
No, we still need to watch further.

1121
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,880
But Jin and Ba,

1122
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,080
I really can’t tell with them.

1123
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
Ba is truly impossible to read.

1124
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,360
Ba is really too hard.

1125
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,320
Has Jin ever been the culprit on this show?

1126
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,440
Hasn’t been the culprit yet.

1127
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, she has.

1128
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,040
The episode with Ba.

1129
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,880
The Black Swan episode, right.

1130
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,640
Yes, she was the culprit.

1131
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,920
She was really hard to spot.

1132
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
No, she had flaws too.

1133
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,040
What flaws did she have that episode?

1134
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,040
She just wasn’t as energetic.

1135
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,880
She gets nervous.

1136
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,920
But you really can't tell.

1137
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,639
Ning.

1138
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,000
Actually, it's a bit hard to tell too.

1139
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
Because when Ning plays the good guy,

1140
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,560
he always seems like the culprit.

1141
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,800
Yeah, that's true.

1142
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
Because he leads the pace too much.

1143
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,239
Yeah, he's really good at leading the pace.

1144
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,280
He's always the one guiding everyone.

1145
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,440
So he acts like this when he's a good guy.

1146
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,600
And he acts the same when he's the bad guy.

1147
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
So if he's the bad guy,

1148
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,480
and still leads our pace,

1149
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,040
then it's really hard to figure him out.

1150
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,239
So what is he really?

1151
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,760
He is...

1152
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,120
When he's the good guy, he tends to lead the pace.

1153
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,280
If one day he stops leading the pace,

1154
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,440
then we need to watch out for him.

1155
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,719
It's all messed up.

1156
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,560
This won't explode, right?

1157
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,520
It's not popcorn.

1158
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,760
Does popcorn pop peanuts?

1159
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,239
No, right?

1160
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Popcorn is made from corn.

1161
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,080
Popcorn pops peanuts...

1162
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,000
Ning hasn't said a word.

1163
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,520
I told you.

1164
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,600
His passive skill is being brave alone.

1165
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't think so.

1166
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,560
I think he's suspicious.

1167
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,920
So you really think this round

1168
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,160
is our final

1169
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,600
round for figuring out the crime time tonight?

1170
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,360
Not necessarily.

1171
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,240
This might just be the beginning.

1172
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,040
Not necessarily.

1173
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,440
Let's go.

1174
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,880
Let's go in and see what's going on.

1175
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,280
Are you ready?

1176
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,960
No need to prepare.

1177
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,760
Wait, who’s knocking?

1178
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,760
Don’t move.

1179
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,040
Make a bowl of noodles.

1180
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
These spicy noodles are really hot.

1181
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,440
The chili in your mouth is biting you.

1182
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
Tasty.

1183
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,680
He’s in this season’s show now.

1184
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,640
Acting like a dad everywhere.

1185
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,960
You’re the only one who hasn’t done it.

1186
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,800
I haven’t.

1187
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,440
Soon.

1188
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,640
No, just having a younger brother is enough.

1189
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,280
I’m used to being a foster father.

1190
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,640
There’s no need for that.

1191
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,480
I survived.

1192
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,640
Don’t worry, you can’t escape.

1193
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,600
No.

1194
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,840
You definitely can’t get away.
