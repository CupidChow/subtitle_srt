1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,880
Hello to all the new residents of Tui Town.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,680
I am Jin Jing.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
I was here around this time last year.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,320
This city may look peaceful on the surface,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,920
but there are hidden currents beneath.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,360
All kinds of rules circulate here.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,320
Whenever the music box plays,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,800
something incredible happens.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,360
All of this deeply fascinates me.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520
So I decided to settle down here

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,280
and search for the truth.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,720
But after moving here,

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,960
things started getting stranger and stranger.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,240
There’s also the frequent appearance of fog,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,960
and occasional sounds of explosions.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,720
Could it be my charm

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,120
that’s disrupting the magnetic field here?

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
This time, I’m planning to join

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,680
the He Li Mo Jin Yu Detective Group

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,320
and go investigate together with everyone

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
what’s hidden in the fog of Tui City

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
and what secrets it truly holds.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
All the media friends present here,

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,200
and all the viewers watching online,

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,000
hello everyone.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Welcome to all the residents of Tui Town,

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,120
no, I mean the new residents of Tui City moving in,

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,000
and welcome back to our longtime residents.

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,280
Let’s hear some response.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,720
Thank you.

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,520
Very supportive.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,440
I almost forgot to introduce myself.

33
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,920
My name is Cui Shaoyang.

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,320
I represent Tencent Video

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
and the third season of "Let’s Start Reasoning".
This is the press conference

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
which starts now.

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,480
Also,

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,800
I am "Cui Shaoyin".

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,840
I represent
the third season of "Let’s Start Reasoning".

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,360
This press conference
officially begins.

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,760
Alright.

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
As everyone can see,

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,200
our city has been experiencing heavy fog lately.

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
Every time this fog appears,

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,320
it means a new incident will occur.

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
It happens randomly.

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
But everyone, please don't panic.

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,480
All of this is normal in our city.

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,000
To help new residents get to know the city better,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
we've decided to hold

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,800
the Tencent Video "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

52
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,520
City of Mysteries Press Conference.

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
We'll reveal to everyone

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,440
the city's strange and mysterious stories.

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
Thanks to the 200 million users who love

56
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,160
our exclusive sponsor, Tongcheng Travel.

57
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,600
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3,

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,120
it's time to uncover the truth.

59
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Together with the unstoppable Tongcheng Travel,

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
let's set off with high energy.

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Now, let's welcome

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,120
the Herlimojinyu Detective Team

63
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,320
to the stage.

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Today we have a very slim friend with us.

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,480
He has also come to the scene.

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,480
Let's first invite our He Li Mo Jin Yu

67
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
to say hello to everyone.

68
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,040
Hello everyone, we are

69
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,640
the He Li Mo Jin Yu Detective Team.

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,440
Welcome, everyone.
Hello, everyone.

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,760
Alright, let's welcome everyone.

72
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Let's also start with Zhang Linghe.

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's introduce ourselves one by one.

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,200
Okay.

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Hello everyone, I'm Bai Yu.

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,800
And I'm from Tui City.

77
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
A relaxed wild man.

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Also the "giant tank" of Tui City.

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
But if you ask who the star of Tui City is,

80
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
I think it still has to be someone who works in the field.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Someone who excels in their profession.

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,320
Zhang Linghe.

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
That's a bit humblebrag.

84
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,720
No.
It's the truth.

85
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Alright, now our Bai Yu.

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
Hello everyone, I am

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Dilraba.

88
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,280
I've unlocked countless language systems in Push City.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
But the one I admire most is still Bai Yu.

90
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
Because when it's dark,

91
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,120
he never gets scared into making meme faces.

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,960
Alright, let's welcome Dilraba.

93
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,160
Hello everyone, I'm Jin Jing.

94
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,200
In the whole detective team,

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm the most charming one.

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
And I hope that next time

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
we won't treat Dilraba

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,760
as a toy for us extroverts.

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Hello everyone.

100
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,400
What, "hello everyone"? Right.

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Next.

102
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Hello everyone, I'm Liu Yuning.

103
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
My arm span is super long.

104
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,000
I can hug anything in one go.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Especially when it's beautiful and startled in the dark,

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,640
like Jin Jing, who's like a little deer.

107
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,080
Sneaking in personal stuff.

108
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Alright, next.

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Linghe.

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,080
All the secrets in Detective City

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,839
can't escape my charming eyes.

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,880
But if we're just talking about ability,

113
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,880
both Bai Yu and I can't match Liu Yuning.

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,440
Finally, let me introduce someone to everyone.

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
This is Zhou Keyu beside me.

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
He is our dispatched reporter from Tui City.

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
He is also the language artist of Tui City.

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,320
And today, coincidentally,

120
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,360
because of our Tui City’s

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
Tui City Oddities,

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
he needs to go out for an interview.

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
So I hope there will be a chance here

124
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,080
to meet everyone again next time.

125
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Thank you all.

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
Alright, thank you everyone.

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,080
And thank you to our Helimo Jinyu as well.

128
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
Would you like to introduce yourselves to everyone?

129
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,760
Because there are many new residents.

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
Our Helimo Jinyu,

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,080
where does this name come from?

132
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,520
What is the reason?

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Last season, it was He Li Mo Yu.

134
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,760
This season,

135
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,920
Jin Jing joined our

136
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
big family.

137
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,480
So now it's He Li Mo Jin Yu.

138
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Oh, that's how it is.

139
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
What about Zhou Keyu?

140
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Are you naturally quiet?

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,840
A real introvert.

143
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
Got it.

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,880
A bit shy.

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,760
Alright.

146
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
So, recently,

147
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
strange news keeps coming out in Tui City.

148
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
To help our new residents

149
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
get to know Tui City better,

150
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
we are about to launch

151
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
the "Born in the Mist" series of reports,

152
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,480
to uncover the truth beneath the mist together.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
In recent years, there have been a series of incidents in Tui City

154
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,160
that have sparked heated discussions among residents.

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,320
Some people have returned to nature,

156
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,400
some have become toys for extroverts,

157
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,320
some have dazzled everyone on the red carpet,

158
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,040
some have installed a voice switch on a lamp,

159
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
some have discovered the truth through taking a pulse,

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
and some have had their mouths "poisoned."

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,120
So, behind these seemingly bizarre events,

162
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,480
what kind of truth is actually hidden?

163
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,080
Now, let's move on to the first segment:

164
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
A new investigation into Tui City's strange stories.

165
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Alright, thank you all for your support.

166
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,080
The rules are actually very simple.

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,520
One member of the detective team

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,160
will come forward to draw a question card.

169
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
They will reveal the name of the person involved in the news.

170
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
and tell everyone.

171
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,680
The other four detective team members

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,120
will have one minute to ask questions.

173
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,840
They must deduce the full event described on the card.

174
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,080
The person who drew the card can give hints.

175
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,720
After the one-minute countdown,

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,040
the person whose guess is closest to the truth will win.

177
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
We have also collected in advance

178
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
some ideas from our media friends.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,880
We made a surprise event punishment blind box

180
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,440
and a "Good Luck in the Detective Market" box.

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
This reward blind box

182
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,160
as you can all see,

183
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,560
is right on the right side of our stage.

184
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Any member of the detective team who guesses correctly

185
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,560
can draw a lucky reward from the box.

186
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
If no one guesses correctly,

187
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,160
the person who drew the question will receive a surprise penalty.

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,640
If anyone has questions about these rules,

189
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,160
feel free to ask.

190
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Understood.

191
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
So there are both penalties and rewards, right?

192
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,320
That's right.
Okay.

193
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Got it.

194
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
Alright, let's have the staff

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
bring up the question cards.

196
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,880
Okay.

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,000
For this, we also need He Li and Mo Jinyu

198
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,240
to choose one person to come and draw a question card.

199
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Sister, you go ahead. Sister.

200
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,360
Where are you going? Stay here with me.

201
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,080
Where are you going?
I'm going back.

202
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
A little lost.

203
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,560
Come, please.

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,280
I'll choose one.

205
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,160
Here.

206
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Here's a question card for you.

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay.

208
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,480
The four of you need to discuss your strategy.

209
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,440
Figure out how to follow her guidance

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
and guess the news event.

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,640
Alright.
And you,

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Jin Jing,
can only tell them

213
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
the two names involved in this news story.

214
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
But I can use gestures, right?

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,360
Of course.
Okay.

216
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,520
How you guide them is up to you.
Alright.

217
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,800
It's your responsibility.

218
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
Zhang Linghe.

219
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Has it started?

220
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Zhou Keyu.

221
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
In that case,

222
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
let's start the one-minute countdown.

223
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Got it.
Stand a bit lower.

224
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,560
Right.
What?

225
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,560
Zhang Linghe.

226
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Red carpet.

227
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
Stand a bit lower.

228
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,600
When taking photos.
Zhou Keyu.

229
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you see that?
That one.

230
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
First day taking photos and walking the red carpet.

231
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,840
Then he said, "Stand a bit lower."

232
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
Stand a bit lower.

233
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,840
Otherwise, I won't be in the frame.

234
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
Zhou Keyu is half a head taller than me.

235
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,280
That's right.

236
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
So what is the complete answer?

237
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,760
The complete one.
Yes, the complete answer.

238
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,800
Complete.

239
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Zhang Linghe, Zhou Keyu.

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
When Zhang Linghe takes photos,

241
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,960
he asks Zhou Keyu to squat down a bit.

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,600
Congratulations to Zhang Linghe for answering correctly.

243
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,080
Right?

244
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,600
This is actually also

245
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,520
So does he get the prize or do I?

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
Of course, he gets the prize.

247
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,520
He guessed it right.

248
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,880
His prize

249
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,480
is basically a reward for your whole group.

250
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,840
Okay.

251
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,160
You can tell
the group

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
really understands each other well.

253
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,280
That was really fast.

254
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
It feels like even a minute

255
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
was more than enough.

256
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,760
Now let's invite Zhang Linghe

257
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,679
to draw for our Lucky Push event.

258
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,760
Just draw one, right?

259
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,960
That's right.
Okay.

260
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,840
What is it?
You read it out loud.

261
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,400
Get from the other members

262
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,320
Get from others

263
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Three compliments from each member

264
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
Each member has to give me three compliments.

265
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
Then Zhang Linghe, you stand in the middle.

266
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,080
Since you're going to receive compliments,

267
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,800
you come stand in the middle.
I'm accepting compliments.

268
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
I'll stand in the middle.
Okay.

269
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,480
You call them one by one.

270
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
Whoever you want to compliment you, will compliment you.

271
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,720
Then let's go in order.

272
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,280
Jin Jing goes first.
Tall.

273
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,600
Big.
Handsome.

274
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Tall, big, handsome. Okay.

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,120
How do we explain this "Zhang Dashuai"?

276
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
Tall, big, handsome.

277
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,600
Zhang Dashuai.

278
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
I thought it was a new nickname.

279
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
Tall means tall.

280
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
Big means

281
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,960
having a big build.

282
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,040
big earlobes.

283
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
Handsome means good-looking.

284
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,040
Okay.
Got it.

285
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,600
Handsome

286
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,760
Tall

287
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Big

288
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
There are no other words, right?

289
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,760
It means

290
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,920
just handsome, tall, and big

291
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,560
Handsome, tall, big. Okay.

292
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,960
Handsome, tall, big

293
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,280
We can't change the combination anymore

294
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,200
Give me something new
Thank you

295
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Tall, handsome, big.

296
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Whoever wants to do this job can do it.

297
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
I can't do it anymore.

298
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
Permutation and combination.

299
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Big, tall, handsome.

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,480
Big, tall, and handsome.

301
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,120
It feels like an ice cream, I think.

302
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,360
Okay.
Got it then.

303
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Then summarize it yourself.

304
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
These three advantages.

305
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
It's being tall, big, and handsome.

306
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,360
Okay.

307
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay.

308
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Good looks, tall height.

309
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
Since it's so simple,

310
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
Does anyone want to do another round?

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,960
Let's do it.
Let's do one.

312
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,280
Let's have someone else draw a question card.

313
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,680
Okay.

314
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,800
You do it.

315
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,080
Go ahead.
You do it.

316
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Let two girls come up, and we'll guess.

317
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Okay.

318
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm ready. You need to give me a signal.

319
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
This one's a bit hard.

320
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,480
Dilraba.

321
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
One minute countdown starts now.

322
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,520
Dilraba, Liu Yuning, Jin Jing.

323
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,160
Dilraba, Liu Yuning.

324
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,160
Jin Jing.

325
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
In the behind-the-scenes, it's just the two of us.

326
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,160
The three of us kept discussing the plot.

327
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,480
Talking about those two.

328
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,520
Liu Yuning and Dilraba must have

329
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
argued intensely.

330
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
They must have debated fiercely about who the culprit is.

331
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,360
The argument was really heated.

332
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
There's one more person.

333
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,000
What is Jin Jing doing?

334
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Dilraba, Jin Jing, Liu Yuning

335
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
They must be arguing fiercely.

336
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:10,800
No.
That's very close.

337
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,880
Try again.

338
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,600
Debating fiercely.
Dilraba, Liu Yuning

339
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Jin Jing

340
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Confused.
Looking completely confused.

341
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,760
No.

342
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,800
Jin Jing
Looking totally baffled.

343
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Caught in the middle.

344
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,520
Right.
Let's say it all together.

345
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Dilraba

346
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Dilraba and Liu Yuning are arguing fiercely.

347
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,880
Jin Jing is caught in the middle.

348
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
Congratulations, you answered correctly.

349
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,240
That was really close.

350
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,400
Pretty much.

351
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
When this question first came up,

352
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Dilraba seemed to respond without even thinking.

353
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She understood it right away.
Yes, she got it.

354
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
Because it happened just yesterday, right?

355
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
So could you help us

356
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
review exactly what happened that day?

357
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
Can you recall that iconic moment without giving spoilers?

358
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes.
I'm really hateful.

359
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,240
No camera caught it at all.

360
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm really ridiculous.

361
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,480
Luckily, no camera caught it.

362
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes, that's right.
The three of us.

363
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
Actually, that recording has already

364
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
that part has already finished.

365
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,520
We walked toward the lounge.

366
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
And the three of us were still tirelessly

367
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
You and I

368
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,280
having a passionate debate.

369
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,480
As for what the result will be

370
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,840
at that time,

371
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
you can watch the show to find out.

372
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,040
That's right.

373
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,000
So, for those who answered correctly this round,

374
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,640
Dilraba

375
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,080
we can also draw one

376
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,440
Lucky Card from Tuishi.

377
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,920
Go ahead.

378
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll draw for her.

379
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,560
What is it?

380
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
Pick someone

381
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
to sing a line of praise for you.

382
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,920
Pick someone

383
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,720
to sing a line of praise for you.

384
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,720
I choose my one and only sister to sing for me.

385
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,880
Use your angry voice.

386
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,760
Sister

387
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,680
I'm coming.

388
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Let me perform a song for everyone.

389
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
Let me perform a song for everyone.

390
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,600
Dililili

391
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,280
Dililili Reba

392
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Dililili Dililili Reba

393
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,880
Dilireba

394
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Thank you.

395
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,280
That was nice.

396
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,320
What does Zhou Keyu think?

397
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,800
Zhou Keyu says nothing, just keeps smiling.

398
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,040
Okay.

399
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,440
Now that we've heard the response from the person involved in the story,

400
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,800
I believe both new and old residents

401
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,560
now have some understanding of this year's Tui City

402
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
after this initial introduction.

403
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,560
Just now,

404
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,240
our field reporter Zhou Keyu

405
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,520
sent us five news reports.

406
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,680
Next, let's welcome He Li Mo Jinyu

407
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,120
to take us into the "Six Minutes in Tui City" segment.

408
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,800
to bring us the latest strange news.

409
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,680
Come on.

410
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,360
Pass the props.

411
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,000
I have some news here, five stories in total.

412
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,680
First, let each member of the detective team draw one.

413
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,240
Then, as members of the Detective Team,

414
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,160
everyone can first get familiar with the news.

415
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,640
Later, using your own style,

416
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,360
for us,

417
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,760
report the news to our new residents.

418
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,680
What do you need to tell everyone?

419
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,160
Among these five news stories,

420
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,640
one is a fake news story.

421
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
After everyone finishes reporting,

422
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
we will invite the new residents in the audience

423
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
to judge by asking questions within a six-minute time limit

424
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
who actually reported the fake news.

425
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,360
Does everyone understand?

426
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
This is what you will be doing in a moment.

427
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,840
Figure out among the six of us

428
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
who is telling the fake news.

429
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,520
Yes.
Okay.

430
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,800
Out of these five people, one is fake.

431
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
So, is everyone

432
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,840
now

433
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,000
familiar with your own news story?

434
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes, we are.
Then let's go in order.
Okay.

435
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,560
Alright.
Good.
Zhang Linghe.

436
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,080
I'll go first.
Okay.

437
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,400
Special City News.

438
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,960
It turns out there is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor hidden in the city.

439
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,560
His pulse-taking skills are exceptional.

440
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
He only needs to gently feel the pulse

441
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,480
to determine the cause of the illness.

442
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,960
As the doctor's reputation grows,

443
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,440
patients come in an endless stream.

444
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,800
His schedule is fully booked.

445
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,480
A patient named Zhou comes after hearing of his fame.

446
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,040
He seeks the master's help to cure his sharp tongue.

447
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
A patient named Liu also comes for treatment.

448
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,560
He wants the doctor to help him

449
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,840
with his timidity.

450
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
However,

451
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,400
because so many people are seeking consultations,

452
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
former patient Jin now finds it

453
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,800
even harder to get a follow-up appointment.

454
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
Everyone might have some guesses.

455
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
Next, let's hear from Bai Yu.

456
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,640
Recently, in a bustling district of the city,

457
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,120
an eye-catching incident occurred.

458
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,320
Several extremely good-looking individuals

459
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,920
gathered on the street.

460
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,480
It is suspected that a secret organization appeared.

461
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,920
According to eyewitness accounts,

462
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,280
the group's movements were mysterious,

463
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,400
with a hint of mockery,

464
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
a touch of indifference, and a bit of nonchalance.

465
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,640
Rumor has it

466
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,280
that the purpose of their visit

467
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,760
was to pull off something big at a countryside inn.

468
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,240
This sudden incident

469
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,880
has drawn the attention of local residents

470
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,840
and sparked widespread speculation.

471
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,280
Alright, now let's hear from Reba.

472
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Dear viewers,

473
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
this is a breaking news report.

474
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
Recently,
a large-scale

475
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,480
themed castle construction project in Tui City

476
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
has begun.

477
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,560
Construction started in the middle of a busy road.

478
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,640
It is rumored that a princess will move in soon.

479
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,040
This project

480
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,080
was designed and built by Tui City's master of aesthetics.

481
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,800
Director Jin is overseeing the construction.

482
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,520
After several minutes of intense work,

483
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,640
the main structure of the building has already taken shape.

484
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
Such an astonishing construction speed

485
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,720
has attracted the attention of many Tui City residents.

486
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,760
This feels like a radio station.

487
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,640
A professional voice.

488
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,360
I need to show some skills too.

489
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
So are you going to use your "angry voice"?

490
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
A female celebrity makes her red carpet comeback after giving birth.

491
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
Why does that sound a bit off?

492
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,960
It's you.

493
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,080
Her beauty caused people to faint.

494
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,880
Early 2025.

495
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
A two-character-named actress returns after childbirth.

496
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
Wearing a gorgeous evening gown.

497
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,760
Attending the Tuiguang Awards.

498
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,120
While appearing on the red carpet.

499
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,080
Her perfect condition amazed everyone.

500
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,240
Unexpectedly, a mass fainting incident occurred at the scene.

501
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
The audience was overwhelmed by her stunning beauty.

502
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
And collapsed.

503
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,720
According to witnesses,

504
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
Dr. Liu arrived quickly.

505
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,800
After a series of examinations,

506
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,840
It was found that there were no serious issues.

507
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,000
They regained consciousness after ten seconds.

508
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
I feel like Jin Jing is reading this news

509
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,760
to make herself sound beautiful, right?

510
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,599
This sounds a bit far-fetched.

511
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,720
Did anyone actually faint at the time?

512
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,760
Do you think this is real news?

513
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,160
Yeah.

514
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
So, is it real news or not?

515
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,720
We'll leave it to our new audience members in a bit.

516
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,359
Now, let's have Yuning report it.

517
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Special Report from Tui City

518
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,240
Tui City Meteorological Station

519
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,640
Fifth Dense Fog Warning Issued

520
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,359
According to reports, whenever the fog exceeds safe levels

521
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,880
there is always a mysterious case of lost items

522
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
According to informed sources

523
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
the personal belongings of a resident surnamed Liu

524
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,680
mysteriously disappear whenever they enter a dark area

525
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
and reappear when brought back into the light

526
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,480
After an urgent investigation by relevant Tui City departments

527
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,840
it was discovered that his belongings

528
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
were being controlled by some mysterious force

529
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,400
and were somehow linked to the city's lighting circuits

530
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,320
A resident surnamed Bai stated

531
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,040
that their similar items have never gone missing

532
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,640
Our reporters will continue to follow up on this story

533
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Thank you, Yuning

534
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,920
That concludes our five Tui City oddities

535
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,320
The report is now finished

536
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,920
Next, it's time for the new residents to ask questions

537
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
Countdown: six minutes

538
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,640
Timer starts now

539
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,240
If anyone wants to ask a question, please raise your hand

540
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
Let me ask Teacher Zhang Linghe a question.

541
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,120
First, what illness does Patient Jin have?

542
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,720
What illness does Patient Jin have?

543
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Patient Jin.

544
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
The cause of Patient Jin's previous illness.

545
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
Everyone should already know.

546
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,240
Now it is already—
She is not sick.

547
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
Patient Jin is actually good news.

548
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
And everyone already knows the good news.

549
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,400
This time, it didn’t happen.

550
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
But judging by her condition today, she seems quite well.

551
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,120
She is very beautiful.

552
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,560
She has already caused three people to faint.

553
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:28,800
Right?

554
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,160
So, when did the traditional Chinese medicine doctor come to Tui City?

555
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
The traditional Chinese medicine doctor arrived in Tui City three or four days ago.

556
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,720
He was already this famous three or four days ago.

557
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,080
Three or four days are enough for his reputation to spread.

558
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,080
What made him so popular?

559
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,880
It’s because of his—

560
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,600
Good looks.

561
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Pulse-taking skills and professional expertise.

562
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:52,880
Yes.

563
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
It’s truly breathtaking.

564
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
A whole set of consecutive moves.

565
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,440
So, I’d like to ask—

566
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,280
Are there any other new residents

567
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
who would like to ask a question?

568
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,680
Okay, please pass the microphone.

569
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,200
Hello, I'd like to ask Ms. Jin Jing a question.

570
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,880
It's about your fainting incident.

571
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
Let's review it first.

572
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
The key elements at the scene.

573
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
Such as the time and place.

574
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,160
And who was present at the scene?

575
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
The time is early 2025.

576
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,920
The place is Tuiguang Xiaoshang.

577
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,240
The person is a two-character actress at her most stunning.

578
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,720
And everyone who was mesmerized.

579
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I'd like to ask again,

580
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
to review this fainting incident.

581
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,600
What exactly was the scene like at the time?

582
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,480
Specifically, it was because

583
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
the two-character actress's charm was overwhelmingly intense.

584
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,280
It overwhelmed everyone present.

585
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,640
Her aura was simply too powerful.

586
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,040
But people lacked the stamina and composure to withstand it.

587
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,200
So they all fainted.

588
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Who were the ones who fainted?

589
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,400
Everyone.

590
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,480
A bunch
Yes

591
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't even know their names
None of them brought their ID cards

592
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Are there any other residents who want to ask questions?

593
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,920
Okay, please pass it along

594
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Excuse me

595
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I’d like to ask Teacher Reba

596
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,400
You just mentioned

597
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
that this castle was built

598
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
in the middle of a busy road with traffic

599
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Yes

600
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
May I ask during which period?

601
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
Were there no cars passing by then?

602
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Because a princess is moving in,

603
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,080
they started construction

604
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,680
right in the middle of a busy road.

605
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,200
This sparked a lot of discussion.

606
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,840
Let me ask Director Jin,

607
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,960
what method did you use?

608
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,560
How was it built in just a few minutes?

609
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,520
Because she is a very skilled master.

610
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,040
Director Jin,

611
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,360
so her few minutes

612
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,560
are like several months for others.

613
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
That's impressive.

614
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,720
So she used just a few minutes

615
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,440
to energize the whole scene.

616
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,000
Then she got everyone to follow her instructions.

617
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,640
Because she really has that ability.

618
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,400
Alright.

619
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
Okay, are there any more questions?

620
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,360
Please pass the microphone.

621
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,960
Hello, I have a question for Liu Yuning.

622
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,800
This resident surnamed Liu,

623
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,480
what exactly did he lose?

624
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
It is something

625
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,040
that can't be touched.

626
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
How many times has it been lost?

627
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,720
He already said it.

628
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,880
Every time he loses the light,

629
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,480
this thing disappears.

630
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,240
But on the other hand,

631
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Bai Yu has never lost this thing.

632
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,040
Then why do residents with the surname Bai

633
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
never lose these things?
Because he

634
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,760
doesn't have

635
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,000
anything to lose.
Nothing to lose.

636
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,080
Alright.

637
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
Now, our next resident with a question

638
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,560
would like to ask Teacher Bai Yu

639
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
about the details of this mysterious incident—

640
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,280
specifically, where and when did it happen?

641
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,400
Very loud and clear.

642
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
The specific time it happened

643
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,840
was a few days ago, right?

644
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
I don't remember exactly when a few days ago.

645
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,040
And the location is

646
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,640
suspected to be in a busy district.

647
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,840
In a bustling district of Tui City.

648
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,560
At that time, I guess I was just like,

649
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,600
I had also heard about it.

650
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,720
It was a group of really cool people.

651
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,440
And then, what else...

652
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,200
They were holding some things in their hands.

653
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
Standing there, not sure what they were doing.

654
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,800
Anyway, they just looked really cool.

655
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,480
All of these sound like fake news.

656
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay.

657
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,520
So, does anyone else have questions?

658
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
Our time is almost up.

659
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,680
Alright, our six minutes are up.

660
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
So in a moment,

661
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,160
our new residents in the audience

662
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,000
will have to judge based on the five answers just given

663
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,520
and make a decision.

664
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,880
Each person can only vote once, okay?

665
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,960
Are you ready?

666
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,840
We'll start with Ling He and go in order.

667
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,040
If you think Ling He reported fake news,

668
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,760
please raise your hand.

669
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:38,840
Okay.

670
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,360
Not a single one.

671
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,920
Then, if you think Bai Yu

672
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
reported fake news,
please raise your hand.

673
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,000
One vote.

674
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
If you think Reba reported fake news,

675
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,000
please raise your hand.

676
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,400
How many
Raise it higher

677
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,480
One, two, three

678
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,560
Four, five, six

679
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
Eleven people

680
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,880
Twelve people

681
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,440
I really want to be elected

682
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
It seems being pretty is also a crime

683
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,560
Those who think what Jin Jing said is fake news

684
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,240
please raise your hand

685
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,880
One, two, three, four

686
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Five
There are five votes

687
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,480
Are you watching the "Tui Guang Xiao Shang"?

688
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,880
There are five votes

689
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,880
So now

690
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,720
These four people don't trust your looks

691
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
They're questioning this point

692
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,120
Right
Okay

693
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,600
So those who think Yuning gave the fake report

694
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,240
please raise your hand

695
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,000
One vote

696
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,480
Is it really that believable? Is it true?

697
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,120
Innocent

698
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,360
Alright

699
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,520
Now that everyone has finished voting

700
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,840
Our Reba has the most votes

701
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,000
So the person who actually reported the fake news

702
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Who is it?

703
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,640
Now please step forward boldly

704
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,240
Mine is the real fake news.

705
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,880
You guessed wrong, didn't you?

706
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,160
Everyone will lose.

707
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,240
In my news report,

708
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
most of it is actually true.

709
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,520
But the last three patients who came for consultation

710
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,480
were actually fabricated.

711
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,640
The patients with the surnames Zhou and Liu

712
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,160
didn't come for consultation at all.

713
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,320
Only the patient surnamed Jin came for a follow-up.

714
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,360
I also checked her pulse.

715
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,840
The traditional Chinese medicine doctor also checked her pulse.

716
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
She is very healthy.

717
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,360
And then the patient surnamed Liu

718
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,000
said this time

719
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,560
that he will never have the symptom of timidity again.

720
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,440
This time, he is definitely

721
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,520
the "Iron Titan" of our team.

722
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,400
That's me, that's right.

723
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,320
Am I "iron" now?

724
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,480
Am I the "Iron Titan" now?

725
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,560
Pure "iron" now, buddy.

726
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,040
A few days ago,

727
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,880
did everyone think he was the "Iron Titan"?

728
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,600
Not bad.

729
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,760
Not bad, there's improvement.
Not bad.

730
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
So, our top-voted Reba,

731
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
why don't you tell us what happened back then?

732
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Because what I have is real news.

733
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,080
On the day we walked the red carpet,

734
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,120
since there was a live broadcast,

735
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
I awkwardly dug out a "castle" with my toes.

736
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
So it's true.

737
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,840
In the middle of a busy walkway,

738
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
they laid out a red carpet.

739
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,280
Actually, it was in front of that farmhouse.

740
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,560
Yes.

741
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,080
There were a lot of staff around.

742
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,240
And Manager Jin was directing me.

743
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,960
Telling me to walk the red carpet with my head up and chest out.

744
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,840
So this "castle"

745
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,640
was made by my toes digging into the ground.

746
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
This is real news.

747
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,360
That's right.

748
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,800
So, I want to congratulate our

749
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,000
Zhang Linghe

750
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,920
He used his own report

751
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,040
and successfully fooled everyone.

752
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,720
You also get a

753
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,480
Lucky Card for the Push City game.
This is your second time, right?

754
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,680
Draw another one.

755
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,600
Draw again.
Draw another one.
Okay.

756
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,520
Appoint someone to grant you a wish.

757
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
Appoint someone for me.

758
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,080
Appoint someone to grant a wish for me.

759
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,880
A wish card.

760
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
What wish?

761
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
It's time for some people to take action, isn't it?

762
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,240
Alright, thanks for the reminder.

763
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,560
In this episode,

764
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,600
In this season,

765
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,760
Our group has a common goal.

766
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,480
It's called

767
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Defeating the "evil force."

768
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,080
No.
There definitely is.

769
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,760
So I'm taking the lead here.

770
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm being the trailblazer here.

771
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,400
I want this "evil force"

772
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,120
to dance for us.

773
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
Or sing a song, that's fine too.

774
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,520
So who is the "evil force"?

775
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,480
The "evil force" is our

776
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Mr. Bai, Bai Yu.

777
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,400
Let's welcome our "colorful male actor."

778
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
Dancing or singing, either is fine.

779
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,800
How about a lively song and dance?

780
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,920
Right, that recent one we did—

781
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,080
No, in that recent show,

782
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,800
Which dance did you master well?

783
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Didn't we learn a bit of robot dance?

784
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,480
You can do one for us.

785
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,440
Okay, I just suddenly remembered a part.

786
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,000
You can invite your partner.

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
I'll invite my partner.

788
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,520
No.
Not me.

789
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,880
I kind of forgot that part.
But I...

790
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,120
Even though I'm not very coordinated,

791
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll still try my best to

792
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,120
recreate the dance I learned.

793
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,920
Okay.

794
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,440
Come on, let's start the music.

795
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,640
Don't we need music?

796
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,080
There's no music.

797
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,360
That kick looks familiar.

798
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
The last one is very important.

799
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Okay.

800
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,720
Are you guys doing that dance?

801
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
What did you think it was?

802
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,760
Let's do it all the way through.

803
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,840
Should we join him and dance together?

804
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,920
Come on, let's do it together.

805
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,880
You're helping me fulfill my wish.

806
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
That one, did you forget?

807
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,240
Come on.

808
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,800
Together.
Three.

809
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,400
Two.
One.

810
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Go!

811
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,760
Final pose
Three, two, one

812
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Did you understand it?

813
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,400
No.
You didn't understand it, right?

814
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
That's right.

815
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,960
If you didn't understand, go watch our main video.

816
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,840
How is it?

817
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,080
Are you satisfied with this wish?

818
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,320
What do you think?
I feel like you're very happy.

819
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
Yes, I'm very happy.

820
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,920
Alright, so the strange stories in our city of Tui

821
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,080
are always emerging one after another.

822
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,560
No sooner does one end than another begins.

823
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
Every resident of Tui City

824
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,840
could become the subject of a strange story.

825
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,960
And He Li, Mo, Jin Yu

826
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,120
the six members of the detective team are no exception.

827
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,600
Now, let's move on to

828
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,920
the "Tui City Six" segment.

829
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Let's see, in their eyes,

830
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,960
which strange stories are connected to each other.

831
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,720
As for their views on

832
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,040
how they see each other

833
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,400
what do they really think?

834
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Veteran actor.

835
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,080
He was here last season too, right?

836
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,720
Yes.

837
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,560
So on here

838
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
there are many words related to everyone.

839
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,600
Everyone can pick some.

840
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,520
Choose words for others that match their

841
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,320
performance in "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

842
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
Choose words that fit their performance.

843
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
Pick one word for each person.

844
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Then stick them on each other.

845
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,120
Don't forget

846
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,080
to stick one on our field reporter too.

847
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,040
Except for him,

848
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,240
each of us should have

849
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,320
four stickers.

850
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Alright, let's do it.

851
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
We can start choosing now.
Pick freely.

852
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Come on.

853
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,400
Except for yourself.

854
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,000
Stick it on some other people.

855
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,200
Yes.
Here, take this.

856
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,640
Just pick a sticker for everyone.

857
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
So if everyone sticks four, that means

858
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,600
If everyone sticks five, including Zhou Keyu,

859
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,640
but Zhou Keyu can't stick them for you.

860
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,560
So each of you gets four.

861
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,600
Okay.

862
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
At an age when you can't keep secrets
Is there something you want to say?

863
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,000
I kept it to myself.

864
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,720
It looks like everyone is choosing very carefully.

865
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,080
How many can each person choose?

866
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,200
Five.

867
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
You need to give one to each person.

868
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
Give one to each person.

869
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,200
One for each person.

870
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,320
Of course, you can give out more if you want.

871
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
Just give out a few more.

872
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Save a few.
There's another round coming up.

873
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,520
Can one person give two to someone?

874
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:52,960
Of course.

875
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,480
Who do you want to target?

876
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,880
Maybe you have more thoughts now.

877
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
In the new season,

878
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Alright.

879
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,760
Sure, I'll stick it on.

880
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,400
Should I stick it on the back?

881
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,840
You can stick it on the front or the back.

882
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
Is it that this sequin is hard to stick on?

883
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,760
Let me help you stick it on your back.

884
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,040
Do you still want your hair?

885
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,680
It's hard to stick.

886
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,000
If it's hard to stick,

887
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,320
why don't we just hand them to each other directly?

888
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,400
Let's all stick them on

889
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,640
Keyu, that'll be fine.

890
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
We'll just hold the rest in our hands.

891
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,800
Because our clothes are very fancy

892
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,320
and all sparkly, it's hard to stick things on.

893
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,000
This one's for you.

894
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,640
Right, if you can't stick it on, just hold it.

895
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,200
Each person takes four.

896
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,280
There will always be one person who doesn't match.

897
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,840
What should we do?

898
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,960
Ke Yu can't stick it.

899
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,280
Take five, then. Okay.

900
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
Take this, it's for you.

901
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,960
You already have four.

902
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,120
That's enough.
How come there are five?

903
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,600
There’s no way five people gave you stickers.

904
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:48,920
Maybe.

905
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
Maybe one person gave you two.

906
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
Could it be that Zhou Keyu came too?

907
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,640
I have five.

908
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,400
Maybe someone is targeting you, Zhang Linghe.

909
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,960
It’s fine, one more doesn’t matter.

910
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, one more doesn’t matter.

911
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,720
This

912
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Aren't you embarrassed not to hold this yourself?

913
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,400
Take it.

914
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,360
Do I really have to hold this for myself?

915
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,960
It's just a small favor.
I'll give it to you.

916
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll give it to you.
It's just a small favor.

917
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:12,960
Okay.

918
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,040
Okay.

919
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,600
So, have we finished choosing?

920
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,440
Finished.
Alright.

921
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,800
Done.

922
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,120
Bai Yu
I'm done choosing.

923
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,320
Finished.
I've given them all out.

924
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,440
Alright.

925
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
I just didn't stick one on Zhou Keyu.

926
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,920
Now we can see that everyone has a few on them.

927
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
There's still one more here.
It's quite a lot.

928
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,600
Alright, let's show

929
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,760
what tags everyone has received.

930
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Then starting from Zhang Linghe,

931
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,360
let's have everyone talk in order

932
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,280
about why they gave out these tags.
How about that?

933
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,440
Alright, Zhang Linghe, what did you get?

934
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,400
IE browser

935
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,080
IE browser
What is this?

936
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,720
What does it mean?
Who posted this?

937
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,640
Actually, it's just that

938
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
sometimes, for example, with some

939
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,640
when it comes to things that require precise calculation, he's really good

940
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,240
his brain is comparable to a computer

941
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,720
Got it

942
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,120
I thought it meant the IE browser is really slow

943
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,600
and not easy to use

944
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,120
Refined mind, unfinished mouth.

945
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
Refined mind, unfinished mouth.

946
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,120
This is
I put this up.

947
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,560
You gave it to me.
Yeah.
Why?

948
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,600
Actually, he's really smart.

949
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,960
But every time someone accuses him of being the "culprit,"

950
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,640
he just... you know,

951
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,560
doesn't know how to argue back.
Yeah, that's just how he is.

952
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,680
Main dancer of the group

953
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,960
I posted this one too.

954
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
Yeah, because I think in the first episode,

955
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,240
my biggest gain was learning a dance.

956
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,880
It was from him.

957
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,800
What dance? Which dance?

958
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,480
The one we just danced together.

959
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,200
Little Laozi

960
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
Who's laughing? Laughing so loudly.

961
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,600
Little Laozi

962
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,080
I posted it.

963
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,080
Actually, I mean the same as Ning.

964
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,680
Smart brain, unpolished mouth

965
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
That's Zhang Linghe.

966
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,000
Everyone can see his looks.

967
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,240
He looks like a noble young master with a strong presence.

968
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,160
A few days ago,
there was a long segment

969
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,080
where he had a monologue identifying him.
It was like, "Why is it you?"

970
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
"Why is it you?"

971
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,560
Then Zhang Linghe was over there,

972
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,200
lifting his head as the light hit him,

973
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
looking like he was about to argue back.

974
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Then he walked over and said, "It wasn't me."

975
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,120
You guys roasted me so much my rhinitis flared up.

976
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Yeah.

977
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
City Hawk-Eye.

978
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
City Hawk-Eye is...

979
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:05,920
I put that label on.
You gave it to me.
Right.

980
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,800
He's actually pretty good at judging people.

981
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,639
Really.
Sometimes, when others...

982
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,719
We talk a big game.

983
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,159
But sometimes he's really accurate.

984
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,560
But he's not always right.

985
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
Yesterday, he was especially accurate.
Yesterday.

986
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,719
Very accurate.
Yesterday, his judgment was spot on.

987
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,440
Who is the worst at judging people?

988
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,600
Who's the least accurate at judging people?

989
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
Who can't judge people well?

990
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,800
Please look forward to our main episode.

991
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,280
That's how it is.

992
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,600
We're all pretty good at judging people.

993
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,040
Small eyes have their own advantages.

994
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,440
Let's take a look at Bai Yu.

995
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,159
Bai Yu also has five tags.

996
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,440
Let's check it out.

997
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,480
What does "randomly acting out" mean?

998
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,440
Randomly acting out.

999
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,320
Me.

1000
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,159
Because

1001
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,159
It's just because

1002
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,199
Everyone will be able to see it when it's aired

1003
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,480
So let's not spoil it for now

1004
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,159
I understand what you mean

1005
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,800
You can't guess his identity at all

1006
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes

1007
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay, so who's next?

1008
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,800
Invincible

1009
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,960
Invincible Wreck-It King? Why?

1010
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,520
Prop Wrecking King

1011
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
I gave him that name

1012
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,200
I don't think I broke anything though

1013
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
What title should we give him?
Just

1014
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,000
What was it called again?
Invincible Wreck

1015
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,400
It's just that thing of his
Bai Dapao

1016
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,240
Bai Dapao, right.

1017
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,480
Yeah, he hasn't started blasting yet.

1018
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,160
There will probably be a segment for that later.

1019
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,880
I remember in the last season,

1020
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
it was already pretty obvious.

1021
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah.
I don't agree with that.

1022
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,160
No.

1023
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,440
I won't do that this season.

1024
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Every time he comes across
a door that won't open,

1025
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
he says, "Break it open, break it open."

1026
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,000
This needs to be blown up.

1027
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,720
We need to solve the puzzle.

1028
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,880
He says, "No, break it open."

1029
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,320
That's it.

1030
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,960
I've changed.

1031
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,600
He has changed.
Changed.

1032
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,160
He’s become more destructive.

1033
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,920
No.

1034
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,360
Okay, what about the next one?

1035
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,520
Mood stabilizer.

1036
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,520
This one is—

1037
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,920
I put that label on him.

1038
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,200
Really?

1039
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
He’s way too stable.

1040
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Stable destruction.

1041
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,360
No matter how you call him, there’s no way—

1042
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
—to get him to stand up from that chair.

1043
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
Right.

1044
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,240
Honestly, what I think is most impressive about him is—

1045
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,760
We have about a dozen different scenes.

1046
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
I’m not exaggerating, right?

1047
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
He can always, in every scene,

1048
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,760
find a stool just for himself.

1049
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,200
Yes.

1050
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,600
You’re biased against me.

1051
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,520
That day, there was a whole row of stools.

1052
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,120
Just a row of stools, and I was sitting there.

1053
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,400
How did you even find a stool here?

1054
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,320
I told you, look ahead.

1055
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
There’s a whole row of stools over there.

1056
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,320
No, it’s because, for example—

1057
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,960
—for example, when we’re doing reasoning sessions,

1058
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,120
we prepare little stools around us.

1059
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,400
We all sit in a circle on the little stools.

1060
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,080
Then, while we’re chatting, he just leaves.

1061
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
He leaves, and we think—

1062
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,960
—maybe he thought of a clue.

1063
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,560
Maybe he went to get something.

1064
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,480
But he comes back pushing an office chair.

1065
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,320
Sit here.
This one is good.

1066
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,360
He's like this.

1067
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,000
He sits very steadily.

1068
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,680
He's like a stabilizer when sitting.
Yes.

1069
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
Got it.

1070
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,800
And then there's also a sapiosexual god.

1071
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,200
Who is it?
I posted this, I did.

1072
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,800
He's just a very

1073
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,800
emotionally stable person,

1074
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,320
and also very intelligent.

1075
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,200
That's the vibe.

1076
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,960
You still love him that much.

1077
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,280
Yeah.
It's always like this.

1078
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,080
I wanted to say that too.

1079
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
I thought it had already stopped.

1080
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
I thought after last night,

1081
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,320
you'd feel a bit better.
No.

1082
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm just recommending this guy to everyone.

1083
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,080
Didn't expect you'd forget again after waking up.

1084
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,560
Yeah.

1085
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Okay, there's one last one.

1086
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,680
This one is the relaxed wild man.

1087
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,520
I came up with that.
Relaxed wild man.

1088
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,160
Sounds good.

1089
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,680
He's just super relaxed over there,

1090
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:58,920
being wild,

1091
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,960
acting like a wild man.

1092
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,480
Yes, acting as a wild person in a very relaxed way.

1093
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,280
Okay, that's fine.
Understood.

1094
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,560
There's actually quite a contradiction in this person.

1095
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
Sometimes the emotions are stable, and then suddenly...

1096
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,720
...there's a strong sense of contrast.

1097
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,160
Yes, very contrasting.

1098
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,280
And then our Reba got

1099
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,440
four tags.

1100
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,920
Gossip enthusiast.

1101
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
This, this one is from me.

1102
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,600
I put it on.

1103
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,280
Yes, that's her.

1104
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,480
She especially loves watching those little drama scenes.

1105
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,440
Those melodramatic shows.

1106
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,800
Every time we finish acting something out,

1107
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
we have to tell Reba about it.

1108
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,520
To talk about it, right?

1109
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,880
Like kneeling on the chair or something.

1110
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,680
I can't imagine it, I have to see it.

1111
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,040
Just like that.

1112
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
And then the second one.

1113
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
Stylist's muse.

1114
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
That one was from me.

1115
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,880
Every time Reba's styling is absolutely stunning.

1116
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,280
Yes.

1117
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,960
And last time,

1118
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,760
didn't that even trend online?

1119
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,480
Wasn't it that, that blonde hair?

1120
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,680
That's the one you mentioned.

1121
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
The one you imitated of hers.

1122
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,440
The blue eyeshadow?

1123
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,920
I went back and tried to imitate it.
Which of her looks hasn't trended online?

1124
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,120
Blonde hair.

1125
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,960
It's the one who was bouncing in front of me.

1126
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,200
She really

1127
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,120
She really knows she's a princess.

1128
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,040
I couldn't get out of that trending topic.

1129
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,800
And in her original video,

1130
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
she walked like this.

1131
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
Maybe my imitation wasn't very accurate.

1132
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
After I finished watching,

1133
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
I kept standing in front of the mirror,

1134
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,120
wondering how to dance it,

1135
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,000
and how to capture that feeling in my dance.

1136
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay

1137
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,120
The third one is

1138
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,640
"Subtle live-action abstraction"

1139
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,480
Why?

1140
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,840
Because I think

1141
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,960
this is one of her tricks.

1142
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,360
She has fooled us with it many times.

1143
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes.

1144
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,760
She’s really good at performing "subtle live-action abstraction."

1145
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,400
This is a move she uses in certain roles.

1146
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,520
It's a trick she often employs.

1147
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
And every time, she manages to fool us.

1148
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
She can abstract things to the point that

1149
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
Saying some really strange things

1150
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,840
also creates a strong sense of contrast.

1151
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,360
Actually, each of us has a contrasting side.

1152
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,520
I can't give too many spoilers.

1153
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,200
But it's just a little quirky in real life.

1154
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,640
Looking forward to the main show, as always.

1155
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,600
The last one.

1156
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,760
Ctrl V

1157
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,120
Master of imitation

1158
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
This is my label for her.

1159
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,800
Because she can imitate so many

1160
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,680
different ways of speaking.

1161
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,720
She imitates them really well.

1162
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,320
And she can do it after hearing it just once.

1163
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,280
Yes.

1164
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
So when she was reading the news just now,

1165
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,520
I really thought it sounded professional.

1166
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,960
Yes.
Now, our next person.

1167
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,360
What about the labels for Jin Jing?

1168
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,920
Alright, the first tag.

1169
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,040
Unconventional thinking.

1170
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,520
Who put this on?
Who tagged me with this?

1171
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,040
I guess everyone wanted to tag it.

1172
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,720
But there’s only one.

1173
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,040
I think I was the one who put it on.

1174
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,200
And that’s because of her.

1175
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,320
With her joining us this season,

1176
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
the whole way our story unfolds

1177
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,280
not only gained a lot of new threads,

1178
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,600
but also a lot of jokes.

1179
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,280
The funny parts, yes.

1180
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,560
This really hits my sense of humor.

1181
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760
It’s me.

1182
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,480
Because every time she

1183
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,400
no matter what she says, I just want to laugh.

1184
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,960
Because she really is funny.

1185
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,600
Actually, it’s not just me.

1186
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,760
Everyone laughs.

1187
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,120
Yes.

1188
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,320
Right, so it really livens up

1189
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,520
the atmosphere on set.

1190
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,400
Because sometimes, yes,

1191
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,560
sometimes everyone gets really nervous.

1192
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,320
Sometimes when we’re reasoning things out,
Yeah.

1193
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,480
we really need someone like that.

1194
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,840
The god in charge of the CCD.

1195
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,400
What does CCD mean?

1196
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,440
CCD, that thing.

1197
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,840
The camera.
The one from yesterday.

1198
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,200
That camera.
Camera.

1199
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,160
Yeah, I gave him one before.

1200
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
An amazing photo.

1201
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,640
With your cooperation.

1202
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:10,840
Right.

1203
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,040
Your real appearance.

1204
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,160
The team allowed it to be posted.

1205
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,080
Okay.

1206
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,240
Sure, no problem at all.

1207
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,680
If you post it, the team will sue you, I'm telling you.

1208
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Alright, we're looking forward to that amazing photo.

1209
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,120
Okay.

1210
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,400
There's another one.

1211
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,000
The zero-frame starter master.

1212
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That's my title for her.

1213
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,880
Sometimes, when we're on site,

1214
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,440
and our reasoning hits an awkward point,

1215
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
she'll suddenly jump in and wake us up.

1216
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,480
Just like she did yesterday.

1217
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,680
She snapped us out of that post-meal drowsiness.

1218
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,440
Completely woke us up.

1219
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,400
Changed the mood, changed the atmosphere.

1220
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,720
Yeah.
That's right.

1221
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,280
Zero-frame starter means

1222
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,600
I wasn't prepared at all.

1223
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Not on guard at all.
We were eating.

1224
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,880
She suddenly stood up.

1225
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
You little "culprits."

1226
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
There's absolutely no wind-up.

1227
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,080
Yeah.
I think it's pretty—

1228
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,360
That's actually pretty good.
It's fun.

1229
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,480
So let's take a look

1230
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,800
at the labels associated with Liu Yuning.

1231
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,000
Looks so miserable after the lights are off.

1232
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,200
I put this up.

1233
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
It wasn't from me.

1234
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,200
Then what are you trying to say?

1235
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,840
I want to say

1236
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,960
His luck isn't that bad this time, right?

1237
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,320
Yes.

1238
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,120
But it's okay, it's fine.
It's a bit better this time.

1239
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,200
Right.

1240
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,680
Actually, this time there weren't as many

1241
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,560
moments that make you feel unlucky.

1242
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,640
So it's actually not too bad.

1243
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,040
But I'm really looking forward to the next few episodes.

1244
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,720
Okay.

1245
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,800
There will be this expression.

1246
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,960
Like a growth arc.

1247
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah, I think this time after you turned on the light,

1248
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,680
you still looked pretty unlucky.

1249
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,400
No, you can't say that.

1250
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,680
Who made him so unlucky?

1251
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,960
Let's just look forward to the main episode.

1252
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,480
This is the best bro in the show.

1253
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,400
I gave it, bro.
You should give it.

1254
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,080
The best bro.
You should give it.

1255
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,600
The best bro.

1256
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,760
Don't be fooled by this kind of thing.

1257
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,160
No.

1258
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,480
I mean, this is his way of apologizing.

1259
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,960
You get it, right?

1260
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,320
Why are you still speaking up for him?

1261
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,840
This isn't to apologize.

1262
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,360
This is how I truly feel.

1263
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,640
Okay.

1264
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,320
I'll take it as a compliment.

1265
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,360
The key is to get involved.
You gave this to me, right?

1266
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,840
I did.

1267
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,080
The key is to get involved.

1268
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,440
I just want these four words

1269
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
to wake you up.

1270
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,600
Okay.

1271
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,480
Don’t be fooled by so-called “top drivers.”

1272
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,280
Don’t let them mislead you.

1273
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,840
You need to see some people’s true colors.

1274
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,240
That makes sense.
Alright.

1275
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,280
From today on, we stand united against a common enemy.

1276
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,640
How about it?
That’s the spirit.

1277
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,640
Famous meme creator in Tuishi

1278
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,440
Meme creator

1279
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,120
I think this was supposed to be for someone else.

1280
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,560
I've held onto this for too long.

1281
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,160
Sorry.
It's a bit too hot to handle.

1282
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,440
It's hot to handle.

1283
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,360
Yeah, I should've given it to someone else earlier, but I didn't.

1284
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
What do you think—

1285
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,720
Who do you think is the best meme creator?

1286
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,680
Actually, everyone has it.

1287
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,040
Yes.
I thought only Jin Jing had it.

1288
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,960
Because she might stand out a bit more.

1289
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,360
But actually, everyone else has it too.

1290
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,240
Like that dance just now.
It was amazing, let me tell you.

1291
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,640
Yeah.
Right.

1292
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,920
Our Lao Bai's relaxed vibe,

1293
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,760
and Reba's little quirky moments,

1294
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,040
Right?
A bit quirky.

1295
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,720
That quirky feeling.
And then,

1296
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,960
Jin Jing,

1297
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,840
and even our younger brother's "sharp tongue,"

1298
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,080
all of these

1299
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,720
can create a lot of trending moments.

1300
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,760
This character in our team,

1301
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,320
so this label

1302
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,760
should belong to our He Li Mo Jin Yu.

1303
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,120
That's right.
Yes.

1304
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,200
Okay.
So we

1305
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,320
The last one.
There's one more.

1306
00:42:59,640 --> 00:42:59,960
This is

1307
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,560
an ultimate detail-oriented person.

1308
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,200
After playing these past few days,

1309
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,080
I really have a whole new impression of you,

1310
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,440
Ning.

1311
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,520
I found that you are actually very meticulous,

1312
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,760
and really good at reasoning.

1313
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,320
Your biggest strength

1314
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,840
is your attention to detail.

1315
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,720
But your biggest weakness is also

1316
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
getting stuck in those details

1317
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,360
and not being able to break free.

1318
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,000
I really want to

1319
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,240
Alright, thank you to all five of you.

1320
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
Now we can also see

1321
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,320
that on Zhou Keyu

1322
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
there are actually some labels as well.

1323
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,440
Yes.

1324
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,920
Everyone, feel free to pick one or two and talk about them.

1325
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,280
Who put this one on?

1326
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,560
At the age where you can't keep things to yourself.

1327
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,280
Sometimes, he

1328
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,400
as soon as he thinks of something,

1329
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,720
he will

1330
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,120
"Bro, let me tell you—"

1331
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,840
He'll be like that.
That's so accurate.

1332
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
So true.

1333
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,480
But today, he managed to keep it in.

1334
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:43,760
Yeah.

1335
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,920
What else?

1336
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,520
Which one of you put them up?
The "quitting drum" signs.

1337
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,920
Who put up the "quitting drum" signs?
The "quitting drum" signs.

1338
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,440
Who put them up?

1339
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,520
I didn't put them up.

1340
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,320
Then it must have been me.

1341
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,120
No.
Because he wasn't here.

1342
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,920
So I put up a few more.

1343
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,120
Right.

1344
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,720
Sometimes he can be really...

1345
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,760
...really sure about something.

1346
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,400
Like that day, the two of us...

1347
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,600
The three of us.

1348
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
When the two of us were suspecting you.

1349
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,600
At first, he...

1350
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,800
...was absolutely suspicious of you.

1351
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,440
But then he started to doubt himself.

1352
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,080
He was really confident at first.

1353
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,880
Then he started doubting himself.

1354
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,040
He ended up doubting himself again.

1355
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,120
I put up the "big foodie" sign.

1356
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,320
He really can eat.

1357
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,640
And you have the nerve to talk about others?

1358
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm the same.

1359
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,360
The two of us are...

1360
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,680
...the big foodies of our group.

1361
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:23,840
Yeah.
You two are.

1362
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,360
He came up with a great term for it.

1363
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,720
What is it?

1364
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,320
"Moo-moo eating."

1365
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,200
What else?

1366
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,360
I posted this one too.

1367
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,880
He licked his lips and got "poisoned" by himself.

1368
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:35,960
He's kind of...

1369
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,920
He gives off that innocent, childlike vibe.

1370
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,160
Right?

1371
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,720
Innocent words from a child.

1372
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,760
He's a bit like that—innocent and unfiltered.

1373
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,400
Sometimes his words can be pretty "sharp."

1374
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,680
What else?

1375
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,520
Wall tester

1376
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,880
Whenever we have something

1377
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,440
that's really hard to climb or exhausting,

1378
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:50,920
yes,
he's the one who goes.

1379
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,240
Right.

1380
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,600
For example, if there's a place that's especially hard to climb,

1381
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,120
to get some clue or something,

1382
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,280
he'll just rush over on his own.

1383
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,240
Exactly.

1384
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,160
I thought he was a new member of the demolition team.

1385
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,440
He also takes part in it.

1386
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,680
The judge of the deduction group.

1387
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
I gave him the judge label.

1388
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,720
Because I think sometimes

1389
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,200
he really can bring up

1390
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,040
points that others might have missed.

1391
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,880
And then

1392
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,280
help everyone break out of

1393
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,880
the current popular line of thinking

1394
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,520
or rut.

1395
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,160
Then, in another way,

1396
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,440
think about a different outcome

1397
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,400
and another possibility.
Right.

1398
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,200
Got it.

1399
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
There's also a deduction perpetual motion machine.

1400
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes.

1401
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,600
Right, just full of energy.

1402
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,200
Young.
Yeah.

1403
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,600
Eating while deducing, that kind of vibe.

1404
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:31,720
Okay.

1405
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,160
Since you admire these qualities in others,

1406
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,760
why not have them yourself?

1407
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,320
Because I'm old now, give me a break.

1408
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,520
So everyone can see

1409
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,080
that each of us now has our own label.

1410
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,800
This season,

1411
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,280
our detective team has been upgraded to

1412
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,360
Heli Mo Jinyu.

1413
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,880
So this team,

1414
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
what does it look like in your eyes?

1415
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,320
Everyone, pick a word.

1416
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,920
Let's stick it on our team board.

1417
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,720
How about it?

1418
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,920
Everyone picks a board.

1419
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,360
What does that mean?

1420
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,880
There's a team board behind us.

1421
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,120
Each of us picks a word.

1422
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,160
Stick it on the Heli Mo Jinyu team board.

1423
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,000
Stick it on the back, right?

1424
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,520
Yes, the way you see this team.

1425
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:03,680
This one.

1426
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,000
I'll flip it over.

1427
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,440
Okay.

1428
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,520
Yes.

1429
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,560
Come on.

1430
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:14,840
Everyone, please stick it on.

1431
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,040
Let's take it one at a time.

1432
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,520
Human bullet screen machine.

1433
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,520
Who posted it?
I posted it.

1434
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,000
Because I think

1435
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,880
I feel like when people watch our show,

1436
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,360
they probably have a lot they want to express,

1437
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,920
a lot they want to say, and lots of trending jokes,

1438
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,440
or some fun highlights.

1439
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,040
So there should be a lot of comments on the screen.

1440
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,320
It seems really exciting.

1441
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,160
And it's even overwhelming to my eyes.

1442
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah, throughout our whole show,

1443
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,040
it seems like we usually look very

1444
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,000
outgoing, right?
Introverted.

1445
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,280
We're all pretty introverted, right?

1446
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,440
Being introverted means not liking to talk.

1447
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,720
But during the whole show,

1448
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,640
we just keep talking
and talking.

1449
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,160
When I went home yesterday, my tongue was numb.

1450
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,400
Really?
Yeah, that kind of feeling.
Yeah, exactly.

1451
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,400
Yes.

1452
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,200
I'm actually really loud.

1453
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,080
I thought it was the kind where, after turning off the lights,

1454
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,000
it would still be noisy.

1455
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,080
That kind happens too.

1456
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,560
There might even be some screaming or something.

1457
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,280
It can get so loud that even strong evidence appears.

1458
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:09,680
Doesn't matter, just argue first.

1459
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,160
Argue first, right.

1460
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,080
Everyone, look forward to it.

1461
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,120
And it's very easy on my eyes.

1462
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,520
That's widely acknowledged.
I posted it, yes.

1463
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,760
Everyone gets this.

1464
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,360
Yeah, those who know, know.

1465
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,840
Especially Teacher Jin.

1466
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,120
That's a toy for extroverts.

1467
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,000
I posted it.

1468
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,200
In our group,

1469
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,120
it seems like we're really loud.

1470
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,320
But there are actually a lot of introverts.

1471
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,560
Yeah.
Right?

1472
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,720
Except for Jin Jing.

1473
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,200
I feel like everyone else is an introvert.

1474
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,560
Really?

1475
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,920
You're an introvert too.

1476
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,000
Actually, yes.

1477
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,400
Yes.

1478
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,040
Me, Ning, and Keyu

1479
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,960
are all introverts.

1480
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,280
You know, the three of us are all Capricorns.

1481
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,200
Why do we...
Yeah.

1482
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,560
Our personalities...

1483
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,240
Each region nurtures its own people.

1484
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,320
Yes.
That's right.

1485
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,400
We introverts

1486
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,920
were all played by two extroverts

1487
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,200
right in the palm of their hands.

1488
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,320
Otherwise, we wouldn't have managed to get a three-bedroom apartment.

1489
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,240
Exactly.

1490
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,600
And there's one last thing.

1491
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,080
It made me laugh for no reason.

1492
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,640
This one.
Yeah.

1493
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,040
It always makes me laugh inexplicably.

1494
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,560
Who made you laugh for no reason?

1495
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,320
This show did.

1496
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,360
Hearing your words

1497
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,080
is even better than hearing a good speech.

1498
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,120
Alright.

1499
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,160
So we've finished putting on all the labels.

1500
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,720
After a series of

1501
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,200
mysterious news reports,

1502
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,360
I believe the new residents

1503
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,040
now have some understanding of our city.

1504
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,320
Everyone probably has a lot of questions for Heli and Mo Jinyu

1505
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,600
that they'd like to ask.

1506
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,840
Next is the final segment.

1507
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,480
We'll hand the microphone

1508
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,040
to the new residents here.

1509
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,720
If anyone has questions for the detective team,

1510
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,280
feel free to raise your hand and ask.

1511
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,320
Come on.

1512
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,880
Let's give the microphone to her first.

1513
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,800
Can someone pass the microphone?

1514
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,840
Okay, please go ahead.

1515
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,280
Then I'll ask everyone from He Li Mo Jin Yu.

1516
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,160
Now that everyone is gathered this time,

1517
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,360
who do you all think has changed the most?

1518
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,840
Who has changed the most?

1519
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Liu Yuning.
Liu Yuning, yes.

1520
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,720
That's right.

1521
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,200
Because it seems like he's not afraid anymore.

1522
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,960
Because we...

1523
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,400
Can I say this?

1524
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,880
Because he has...

1525
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,400
He used to always follow behind me.

1526
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,080
But this time,

1527
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,280
he stood in front of me.

1528
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,400
Who says only those in the spotlight are heroes?

1529
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,920
Right?

1530
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,680
Thank you.

1531
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,480
You're welcome.

1532
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,320
Is there anyone else who would like to ask a question?

1533
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,680
Here, take the microphone.

1534
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,480
Excuse me,

1535
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,480
this question is for everyone.

1536
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,080
I just felt

1537
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,480
some of your team spirit.

1538
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,600
So for this season,

1539
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,280
I'm curious about each of you—

1540
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,720
in this show,

1541
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,960
what is your respective role?

1542
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,800
I heard there are some small changes.

1543
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,160
Will there be

1544
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,840
any new role assignments this season?

1545
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,960
We can start

1546
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,160
with Zhang Linghe.

1547
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,000
Starting with me?

1548
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,320
I've been called on.

1549
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,120
Sorry.

1550
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,520
What was my role last season?

1551
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,480
Last season
Nightingale

1552
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,760
Looks, I guess
Yeah, Nightingale

1553
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,600
Nightingale role
Really?

1554
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,400
You were in charge of singing, right?

1555
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,240
I forgot, I think so, yeah

1556
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
So how many tags did you have last season?

1557
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,080
Mobile karaoke room, town's Nightingale

1558
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,440
"Occasional Crazy Guy," decibel generator

1559
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,520
These four

1560
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,600
Then this season

1561
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,880
I'll try to be the calm one

1562
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,960
So calm now
Being the calm one means

1563
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,560
I think you have the reasoning role

1564
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,240
Of course

1565
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,640
You in that...

1566
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,800
Alright, then I'll be the reasoning one

1567
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,400
Okay.

1568
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,560
I'll take this title.

1569
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,280
Alright.

1570
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,440
What about Mr. Bai Yu?

1571
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,320
Here's the thing, because

1572
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,320
I think our team is too strong.

1573
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,840
So strong that it's a little scary.

1574
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,960
So I need to

1575
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,560
make our team look a bit less strong.

1576
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,000
So I'll just

1577
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,360
be the one holding everyone back.

1578
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,000
So humble.

1579
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,640
I'll slow everyone down a bit.

1580
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,920
So you all won't seem so unbeatable.

1581
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,560
Well, you are holding someone back anyway.

1582
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,280
Okay, Reba.

1583
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,760
This time, I kind of want to be

1584
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,320
Maybe the one in charge of contrast.

1585
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,480
The contrast role.

1586
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,520
What kind of contrast are we talking about?

1587
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,640
Maybe it's because of this.

1588
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,120
If everyone watches the first and second episodes,

1589
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,000
you should be able to see

1590
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,200
where the contrast lies.

1591
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
So I want to be someone

1592
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,680
that people can't figure out.

1593
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,880
No one can tell what kind of role I really am.

1594
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,440
I'm hard to read.

1595
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,160
Alright, Teacher Jin Jing.

1596
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,120
She's the "mystery" role.

1597
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,840
You summed it up for her.
Yes.

1598
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
The "fog" role.

1599
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,920
A woman shrouded in mystery.

1600
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,240
Seems like she's charmed you too.

1601
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:16,960
Now it's your turn.

1602
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,280
She charmed me a long time ago.

1603
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,760
She has me completely captivated.

1604
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:19,960
Okay.

1605
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,320
As for me,

1606
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,840
what kind of role am I?

1607
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,480
It's hard to talk about myself.

1608
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,360
You can do it.

1609
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,600
Start by introducing yourself right from the beginning.

1610
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,960
So many roles to play.

1611
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,480
Your looks are the least noteworthy thing about you.

1612
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:31,920
On one hand,

1613
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,200
Right, let's not talk about looks anymore.

1614
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,400
Because I'm pretty tired

1615
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,760
of everyone labeling me that way.

1616
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,320
Yes.

1617
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,520
Then I'll just...

1618
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,600
You summarize it for me.

1619
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,120
My mind just went blank, I can't think of anything.

1620
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,680
I think she seems like the one who sets the mood,

1621
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,800
but actually...

1622
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,760
Exactly, right?
The mood maker.

1623
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,880
That's what it is.

1624
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,480
Yes.
No.

1625
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,640
Then I'm the mood maker.

1626
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,520
Actually, throughout the whole reasoning process,

1627
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,040
whether it's managing the situation or this,

1628
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,360
she's really impressive, her

1629
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,160
logic skills.
She's the logic expert.

1630
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,480
The way she circles around and finally

1631
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,520
Yes, I thought of that too.

1632
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,040
Very impressive.

1633
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,440
And her best quality is

1634
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,000
that she doesn't get distracted by others.

1635
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,080
She may seem distracted,

1636
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,280
but in her heart,

1637
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,080
she sticks to herself.
She really sticks to her own ideas.

1638
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,320
That's right.
Exactly.

1639
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,840
And you just mentioned managing the situation,

1640
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,880
I'm not managing the situation.

1641
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,280
I just want to control you.

1642
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,680
But I can't.

1643
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,000
Alright.

1644
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,560
Okay.

1645
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:20,880
Alright then.

1646
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,600
Now it's Liu Yuning's turn.

1647
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,840
I think I am...

1648
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,880
I know what you are.
Go ahead.

1649
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,080
You're the one who always takes control.

1650
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,720
What do you mean?

1651
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,480
Like, if you want to say something,

1652
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,640
you absolutely have to say it.

1653
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,720
Everyone has to listen.

1654
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
We all get drawn into your logic.

1655
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,520
You literally take control of us.

1656
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,960
Is that true?
Yes.

1657
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,680
The problem is, you didn't control us this time.

1658
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,480
Yeah, I think that's exactly what I am.

1659
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,240
Just someone who acts like a brick.

1660
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,640
I go wherever I'm needed.

1661
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,400
I fill in every gap.

1662
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,840
You don't have to go wherever you're needed.

1663
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,200
You are—

1664
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,440
What am I?

1665
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,640
This season, Liu Yuning

1666
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,160
has to take on the role of an "Iron Titan"

1667
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,240
Yes, that's absolutely right

1668
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,720
Okay

1669
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,760
Charge into battle!

1670
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:01,920
Alright.
Zhao Zilong of Changshan

1671
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,400
The embodiment of courage
Alright, embodiment of courage.

1672
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,120
Bravery through and through.

1673
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,680
That's right.

1674
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,280
Then we

1675
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,640
It's just that you all have too many skills.

1676
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,320
Let's look forward to this season. Thank you.

1677
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,640
Amazing, this season is really

1678
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,120
She can cover my shift.

1679
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,160
Are there any more questions?

1680
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,800
I want to ask Dilraba

1681
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,360
about this familiar group later on

1682
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,440
Does it give you a sense of security?

1683
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,320
Earlier, I saw a

1684
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,760
video everyone made that was quite abstract.

1685
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,960
They were all very cute.

1686
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,240
I also want to ask

1687
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,720
about the third season of "Start Reasoning"

1688
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,920
How did they convince you?

1689
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,560
Thank you.

1690
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,560
That was because I saw it online

1691
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,200
I saw similar videos

1692
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,800
So actually, it wasn't

1693
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,880
the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning" that convinced me

1694
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,880
I just thought it seemed pretty fun myself

1695
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,720
And maybe because when people see some

1696
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,520
dry, just-talking content

1697
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,360
they might not be very interested

1698
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,760
in watching our show

1699
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,960
So I wanted to use this ID

1700
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,360
or rather, to give everyone

1701
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,920
some recommendations to watch our show

1702
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,960
in some short videos

1703
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,080
and add a bit of novelty

1704
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,920
so people can be interested

1705
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,840
And if you ask why I came

1706
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,000
it's because I thought last season

1707
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,720
was actually a lot of fun

1708
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,920
And even though I'm a bit slow

1709
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,640
a lot of the time

1710
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,800
I can't really keep up with the logic

1711
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,520
but I still had a great time

1712
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,960
and everyone got along really well

1713
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,480
so I came back for the third season

1714
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,120
Do we have any more questions to ask?

1715
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,480
Okay.

1716
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,560
Go ahead.
May I ask,

1717
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,280
I’d like to ask Zhang Linghe,

1718
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,520
Everyone jokes that

1719
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,480
after Jin Jing’s child is born,

1720
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,360
the first thing Zhang Linghe will say is,

1721
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,880
“Come solve this problem.”

1722
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,480
So in the future, will there be a chance

1723
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,960
for you to help your little nephew with homework or something like that?

1724
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,520
I think Jin Jing's child

1725
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,880
if he could talk,

1726
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,640
the first thing he'd say definitely wouldn't be this.

1727
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,960
Definitely not.

1728
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,240
I would never say this to her child.

1729
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,680
I would definitely make up for the red envelope first.

1730
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
You can do math problems anytime.

1731
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,080
But the red envelope has to come first.
You didn't give it, right?

1732
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,520
My child, hurry up and start talking.

1733
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,920
The first thing Jin Jing says when she sees me is,

1734
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,200
"Where's your red envelope?"

1735
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,400
The reward is a set of "Five Years Gaokao, Three Years Simulation" books.

1736
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,800
Yes, I definitely need to make up for it.

1737
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,120
Okay.

1738
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,480
Alright.

1739
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,200
I’d like to ask Liu Yuning.

1740
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,640
I heard you watched it ten times.

1741
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,120
"Detective Conan"

1742
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,680
You know all the cases inside out.

1743
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,800
So why in the last season

1744
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,240
didn't you get the Detective Star of the Town?

1745
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,440
And this season,

1746
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,080
are you confident you’ll get the Detective Star of the City?

1747
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,560
Don’t get your hopes up.

1748
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,280
This season, I

1749
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,840
have a chance.
Bro, there’s a chance.

1750
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,000
A good chance.

1751
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,600
Go back and watch it ten more times.

1752
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,040
Go back and cram ten more times.

1753
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,800
Yes.
Yes, that’s right.

1754
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,000
Go back and work harder.
Let’s wait and see.

1755
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:31,960
Okay.

1756
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,360
Does anyone else have questions?

1757
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:33,600
Go ahead.

1758
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,720
I’d like to ask Bai Yu.

1759
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,840
Everyone says you’re a wild person.

1760
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,360
A relaxed wild man.

1761
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,840
Do you have anything to say about that?

1762
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,960
About this label.

1763
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,040
Well said.

1764
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,160
Yeah, being a bit wild is pretty good.

1765
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,600
And just now, during that interaction,

1766
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,440
it felt like Liu Yuning really loves you.

1767
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,720
No matter what you do to him,

1768
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,960
he still loves you very much.

1769
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,880
I love him a lot too.
I really love him.

1770
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,320
Yeah, I'm really curious.

1771
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,640
What exactly did you do to him

1772
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,480
to make him so completely captivated by you?

1773
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,320
No.
It's not that serious, right.

1774
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,760
We're good friends in private too.

1775
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,520
Sometimes it's just a feeling.

1776
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,720
Okay.
There's no reason for it.

1777
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,000
No reason.

1778
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:05,640
It just doesn't come out.

1779
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,480
That sense of trust between us.

1780
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,040
You know?

1781
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:15,840
No.

1782
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,280
It's just that we're actually good friends in private.

1783
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,480
Sometimes when we're together,

1784
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,800
we chat, have meals, things like that.

1785
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,680
So we talk quite a lot.

1786
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,440
Yes, in private.

1787
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,680
A camaraderie.

1788
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,160
Yes, of course.

1789
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Alright, are there any more questions?

1790
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,720
Let's ask a question.

1791
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,560
I'd like to ask our reasoning expert.

1792
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,400
Teacher Jin Jing,

1793
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
this time, as a newcomer,

1794
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,120
joining He Li Mo Jin Yu,

1795
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,720
did you do any preparation before filming?

1796
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,840
How can you become

1797
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,760
the one who hits the same comedic notes as Reba

1798
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,040
and be the variety show lead?

1799
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,440
I think just being myself is enough.

1800
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,520
Even though I'm new,

1801
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,040
filming with everyone

1802
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,680
feels like being with family.

1803
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,640
But this season, really,

1804
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,120
in our first two cases,

1805
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,560
there was a moment

1806
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,520
just now, emotionally,

1807
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,960
it was truly instant, right from the start.

1808
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,160
It really felt like being a family with everyone.

1809
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,040
That was a real instant connection.

1810
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,640
There was a case, a moment,

1811
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,600
that truly made us instantly feel

1812
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,080
It's like being family.

1813
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,360
Yes.
There is that kind of feeling.

1814
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,480
That's right.

1815
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,360
Yes, the kind of sacrifice.

1816
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,640
Sacrificing for each other.

1817
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,200
And I remember before you left, you said

1818
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,400
Take care of my child.

1819
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,200
Yes.

1820
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,960
There are moments like that.

1821
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,560
That moment was quite emotional.

1822
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,000
Yes.

1823
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,600
It's pretty good.

1824
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,840
Now I'm even more looking forward to our main feature.

1825
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,400
Thank you to all the new residents for your questions.

1826
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,240
Let's first invite Heli, Mo, and Jinyu.

1827
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,280
Please stand in the center of the stage.

1828
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,800
Then let's take a group photo together, okay?

1829
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,480
Do you want to hold it up?
Don't hold it up. Give it to me.

1830
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,600
A group photo, right?

1831
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,520
Are we done filming?

1832
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,440
That was really fast.

1833
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,760
Let's thank our Herlimu Jinyu.

1834
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,600

1835
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,840

Thank you, everyone.
Goodbye.

1845
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,960
You found out.

1846
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,960
So many strange tales of Tui City.

1847
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,800
You’ve long since become a part of Tui City.

1848
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,600
Today is just the beginning of it all.

1849
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,360
We’ll meet deep within the mist.

1852
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,480
Waiting for you to join

1853
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,280
We are the new residents who just moved in

1854
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,520
In Apartment 11

1855
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,320
We'll be neighbors from now on
We can look out for each other

1856
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,760

1857

Helimo Jin Yu

1859
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,440
Because we are a family

1860
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,400
What is this thing?

1861
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,120
We're trying every way to escape now

1862
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,440
Helimo Jin Yu Detective Team

1863
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,040
Let's start reasoning

1864
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,840
Do you still remember who you are?

1865
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,320
Your mission

1866
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,280
is to find a very important person.

1867
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:05,880
I can

1868
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,120
let you be reborn

1869
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,400
and go to those places.

1870
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,360
Right now, only one has been revealed.

1871
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,360
It's the Tuitian Confectionery Factory.
You must

1872
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,240
stop him.

1873
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,960
Then let's go look for

1874
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,200
where the Tuitian Confectionery Factory is.

1875
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,160
Tui Sweet Food Factory

1876
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,480
is a factory in Tui City specializing in the production of

1877
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,920
Herimo Jinyu Candy.

1878
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,320
Its exclusive secret syrup

1879
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,280
ensures the delicious taste of the candy.

1880
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,320
At the same time, the sterile production workshop

1881
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
guarantees safety and eco-friendliness.

1882
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,920
As a result, sales have always been good.

1883
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,960
At 8 a.m. on February 25th,

1884
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,480
the employees of Tui Sweet Food Factory

1885
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,840
were each performing their duties at their posts.

1886
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,960
A strange man entered the factory.

1887
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,480
He was searching for something everywhere.

1888
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,640
He saw

1889
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,920
six very peculiar factory workers.

1890
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,880
A strange man is frightened and flees the factory.

1891
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,600
During the process,

1892
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,240
he is tripped by a pair of feet under a dust cover in the corner of the factory

1893
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,760
and falls.

1894
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,800
Looking closely,

1895
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,640
under the dust cover

1896
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,400
is the "body" of the factory owner, Tan Qian.

1897
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,720
After a preliminary investigation,

1898
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,920
the relevant people involved in the case have been identified.

1899
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,480
With a welding torch in hand, I melt iron and forge steel.

1900
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:48,880
Hello, everyone.

1901
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,440
I am a welder at Tuitian Food Factory.

1902
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,160
This room is my dormitory.

1903
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,440
This is my bed.

1904
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,280
I usually rest here.

1905
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,600
And this is my desk.

1906
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,520
There are some small ornaments I like on it.

1907
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:04,600
Yes.

1908
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,880
These.

1909
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,920
And some of my tools.

1910
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,680
This is my certificate of merit.

1911
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,320
Take a look, this is my certificate of merit.

1912
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,960
It shows that I am quite outstanding.

1913
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,720
I am

1914
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,880
the star welder of this factory.

1915
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,800
Although I haven't been at the factory for long,

1916
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,720
because of my outstanding

1917
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,560
professional skills,

1918
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,280
I've earned the boss's appreciation.

1919
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,160
There was a very suspicious person

1920
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
who ran over and found the "body."
And he didn't even stop the guy.

1921
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,360
That person isn't even from our factory.

1922
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,200
He was so suspicious, but he just

1923
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,680
I should talk about you instead.

1924
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,440
I am

1925
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,800
I'm the detective.

1926
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,240
Do your best.
Take off your shoes.

1927
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,520
Always telling others what to do.

1928
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,360
Because I am

1929
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,000
the esteemed detective.

1930
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:53,960
Look over here.

1931
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,600
Check the shelves carefully.

1932
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,520
You're so tall, you

1933
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
You need to search your workstation thoroughly.

1934
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,920
You don't have a single clue or piece of evidence.

1935
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,000
You're so clean.

1936
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,120
That's actually a bit suspicious.

1937
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,160
Why does a security guard need a computer?

1938
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,840
Of course, to monitor the cameras.

1939
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,760
You need to watch the cameras?
Isn't that for surveillance?

1940
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,120
I'm speechless.

1941
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
You, as security,

1942
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,480
are attacking your own people.

1943
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,120
Who are your own people?

1944
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,280
What did I do wrong?

1945
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,680
Why are you bullying me like this?

1946
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,720
Someone is doing this on purpose.

1947
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,320
This is our boss.

1948
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,360
Every day, she gives us

1949
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,560
When she is..., it will...

1950
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,200
Once the wires are connected, all problems are solved.

1951
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,760
I'm the outsourced electrician for Tuitian Candy Factory.

1952
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,560
That's right.

1953
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,240
What you're seeing now is me.

1954
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,400
This is where I work.

1955
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,240
My name is

1956
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,000
Because every week at our Tuitian Food Factory,

1957
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,720
I only need to work two days.

1958
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,480
So,

1959
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,760
this is also kind of

1960
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,680
a simple place for me to stay.

1961
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,240
Come, everyone, take a look.

1962
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,400
Look over here.

1963
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,240
This folding cot

1964
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,480
is where I usually rest here.

1965
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,040
And there are all kinds of

1966
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,400
equipment for electrical repairs.

1967
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,240
Anyway, as long as I'm here,

1968
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,240
all the factory's power and heating

1969
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,400
are related to me.

1970
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,400
I also hope everyone will support my work.

1971
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,280
First of all, I work at this candy factory.

1972
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:27,840
Everyone knows that.

1973
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,960
I'm the electrician here.

1974
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,480
You just talk and do nothing.

1975
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,520
You never take any real action.

1976
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,720
Did you give anything?

1977
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,040
Other people brought gifts.

1978
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,640
Let me tell you,

1979
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,080
this man is totally unreliable.

1980
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,920
Using this kind of flimsy cardboard

1981
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,360
they try to fool us girls

1982
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,960
with flimsy cardboard

1983
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,400
At least others give out a cup

1984
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,960
Alright

1985
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,240
Hello, everyone

1986
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,680
I am "Just Need Eight Parts Sweet"

1987
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,600
which means I can be super sweet with just eight parts sugar

1988
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,200
And today

1989
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,160
we've come to my workshop

1990
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,280
I'm going to give everyone a simple

1991
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,000
tour of my room

1992
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,880
and introduce my work environment

1993
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,480
First, there's this bag of candy

1994
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,720
This bag of candy is my daily work

1995
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,200
What I need to do is

1996
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,080
have our staff

1997
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,440
hand me this net bag

1998
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,880
I'll put these Herlimojinyu candies in

1999
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,560
and put them all into the net bag

2000
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,960
then

2001
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,200
toss it

2002
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,600
and send it out like this

2003
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,840
This is my very simple daily routine

2004
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,440
It's a rather monotonous job.

2005
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,680
I just sit here.

2006
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,960
And this is what I do every day.

2007
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,640
These are the candies I need to package.

2008
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,720
This is the place

2009
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,040
After I finish delivering these candies,

2010
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,080
I need to go find more bags.

2011
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,280
Those bags are over there.

2012
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,440
Then I take these candies

2013
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,680
and put them into the packaging bags one by one.

2014
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,680
Then I wait for the next batch to arrive.

2015
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,720
This is the work I have to do.

2016
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,760
My name is Bafentang

2017
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,520
I'm twenty years old this year

2018
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,680
I'm a candy packer at the candy factory

2019
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,720
There's a password

2020
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,960
The password is

2021
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,440
Really

2022
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,560
Really

2023
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:06,520
You

2024
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,720
You're very suspicious

2025
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,080
It says on it

2026
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,680
Right

2027
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,080
Wait, you're even scarier.

2028
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,360
Really?

2029
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,760
There was a woman yelling nonstop.

2030
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,760
Turns out it was her.

2031
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,480
She's right on your poster.

2032
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,040
Right there.

2033
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,280
There's one right across.

2034
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,320
Opposite the entrance.

2035
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,280
Yeah, the white sign.

2036
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,400
Yes, right across.

2037
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,200
There's another one.

2038
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,840
It might be in this box.

2039
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,840
That's all.

2040
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,240
All set.

2041
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,640
Delicious food is always ready.

2042
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,200
I never hesitate when serving food.

2043
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,240
I'm the head chef of the Tuitian Food Factory cafeteria.

2044
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,640
This is my family's heirloom kitchen knife.

2045
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,440
With it,

2046
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,320
every shredded scallion will look more like a scallion.

2047
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,000
Every slice of ginger will look more like ginger.

2048
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,880
That's my special menu up there.

2049
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,400
Please read it yourselves.

2050
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,960
This is my loving pot.

2051
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,320
If you eat my food, you're one of mine.

2052
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,600
This is my secret peanut oil.

2053
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,800
Every peanut is personally handled by me.

2054
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,960
With love and care.

2055
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,280
Life isn't like plain water.

2056
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,360
But you still need to drink some water.

2057
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,880
Dear, come to my cafeteria for some water.

2058
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,600
My soup is just like water.

2059
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,760
The two of you are at the factory.

2060
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,960
You know.

2061
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,440
You're no longer part of this story.

2062
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,960
How could you do this?

2063
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,040
So what?

2064
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,480
No matter what my identity is,

2065
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,719
as a citizen,

2066
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,120
if I am a consumer,

2067
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,920
if I get deceived,

2068
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,200
I will defend my rights.

2069
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,080
I put on my "black mink coat"

2070
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,400
and sneak in.

2071
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,560
Tell me why.

2072
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,120
Why?

2073
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,000
So it was you.

2074
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,240
Except for the two detectives,

2075
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,840
who can question me,

2076
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,240
no one else should even think about interrogating me.

2077
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,400
Alright.

2078
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,840
Can you do it or not?

2079
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,520
Don't you think I look really energetic like this?

2080
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,600
You noticed.
So, I was...

2081
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,280
You did it to save yourself.
So...

2082
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,120
She might also...

2083
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,280
So, different circles have different overlaps.

2084
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,640
Always inside.

2085
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,400
So, in my heart...

2086
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,920
It feels rather heavy.

2087
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,520
Hello everyone, I'm the king of the cement piles.

2088
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,560
I'm the best at moving bricks and unloading goods.

2089
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,440
I'm from the Tuitian Food Factory.

2090
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,600
I'm both a cement worker and a loader.

2091
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,520
Today, I'll take everyone...

2092
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,360
to take a look at my dormitory.

2093
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,600
As the strongest at Tuitian Food Factory...

2094
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,480
and the most...

2095
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,520
A cultured man

2096
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,600
You can tell just by looking at my dorm room

2097
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
It's full of a sense of strength

2098
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,760
and masculine hormones

2099
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,880
What do you think of this doll?

2100
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,000
Isn't it really strong?

2101
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,480
That's my physique

2102
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:23,960
That's right

2103
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,920
There are also some pieces of exercise equipment

2104
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,600
This is where I usually

2105
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,240
maintain my source of strength

2106
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,920
This doesn't show my business acumen

2107
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,240
But my coworkers at the factory all know

2108
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,760
I graduated from business school

2109
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,320
I also help them with some

2110
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,640
financial planning

2111
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,200
They all really admire me, that's right

2112
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,640
My name is Heniba.

2113
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,320
I'm just an ordinary employee.

2114
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,800
She's the only one I see.

2115
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,560
I send her pictures of my muscles every day.

2116
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,800
I was the one who "killed."
Let's just end it now.

2117
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,280
Then what was your motive for "killing"?

2118
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,720
You all are asking a good person like me

2119
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,920
what my motive for "killing" is?

2120
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,520
No.

2121
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,680
What are you even doing as a security guard?

2122
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,960
This person keeps coming and going.
You can't see it, can you?

2123
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,560
Meeting you.

2124
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,280
Step on what?
Wait a second.

2125
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,800
Step on what?

2126
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,000
Opened that door.

2127
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,560
You can't open the door inside.

2128
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,200
From that video.

2129
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,520
Maybe.

2130
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,360
Hello everyone, I am

2131
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,080
Ke An Kan.

2132
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,160
I am the guardian of our Tui Tian Confectionery Factory.

2133
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,840
Because I am a

2134
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,080
That's right, this is my profession.

2135
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,240
In my room,

2136
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,440
there are a lot of

2137
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,160
self-portraits on the wall.

2138
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,160
Yes, these are all me.

2139
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,560
Of course, I can't do without this sword.

2140
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,680
This sword belongs to Dongfang Yao.

2141
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,040
Actually, on this poster, his sword is

2142
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:52,680
right here.
If you look closely,

2143
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,200
the sword in his hand
couldn't be printed out.

2144
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,000
Because the size is limited.

2145
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,320
This hero is definitely my favorite.

2146
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,720
So I also collect his weapons here.

2147
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,400
You know?

2148
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,320
It's very simple.

2149
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,560
He hired me to work here as a security guard.

2150
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,280
So I came here to protect his safety.

2151
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,760
You are just...
You just work here.

2152
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,640
And then he "died" here.

2153
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,640
I can vote now.

2154
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,560
It's not that simple.

2155
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,040
It's not that simple, okay?

2156
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:23,960
Did you send this?

2157
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,200
Ke'an, look, did you send this?

2158
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,160
I don't remember this.

2159
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,560
I beat you up, and you don't remember?

2160
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,920
I remember you hitting me.
But was it because of this?

2161
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,760
You don't remember?
No.

2162
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:31,720
After you hit me, you just...

2163
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,160
No.

2164
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,480
He really did hit me.

2165
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,080
You have so little work to do,

2166
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:38,880
yet your pay is so high.

2167
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,040
I work so hard,

2168
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,280
I'm here watching every day,

2169
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,360
and you can't even catch a single person in black.

2170
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,320
What's so hard about your job?

2171
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,000
You don't do anything, you just stand there.

2172
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,920
He's the one out there in the wind and sun.

2173
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,280
That's right.

2174
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,920
Wind and sun, really?

2175
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,040
Wait a second.

2176
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,800
You go stand at the door for now.

2177
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:52,920
Why?

2178
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,120
To avoid suspicion.

2179
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,320
Alright.

2180
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,440
Golden Spoon.

2181
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,600
No need to explain any further.

2182
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:01,840
Golden Spoon.

2183
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,880
Honestly, I really suspect him now.

2184
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,160
I think you are the one.

2185
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,320
After that beating I gave you,

2186
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,040
your brain must have gotten messed up.
Let me tell you,

2187
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,680
when this person can't be sure

2188
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,480
when I'll show up today,

2189
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,920
or when I can create this chance encounter,

2190
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,760
there's one thing he can be sure of.

2191
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,720
That is,

2192
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,320
he definitely saw him.

2193
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,640
Today, little brother, give him a big merit.

2194
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:41,880
Mission card

2195
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,520
Today's game is the facial features assembly challenge

2196
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,440
Within two minutes

2197
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,680
find your own correct facial features

2198
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,040
and assemble a complete face

2199
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,720
At the same time, while assembling the facial features

2200
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,760
when you hear the word "love" in the lyrics

2201
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,960
you must make the specified (heart gesture) action

2202
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,280
If you make five mistakes in total

2203
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,800
or fail to assemble the face correctly within two minutes

2204
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,960
the challenge is considered failed

2205
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,280
Only players who pass the game

2206
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,080
can choose a reward

2207
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,560
You really can't tell at all.

2208
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,240
I really can't tell at all.

2209
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,600
This is way too hard.

2210
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:24,960
No.

2211
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,920
Do I have to match everyone correctly?

2212
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,880
Or just match one person?

2213
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,960
Match myself.

2214
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,360
Timer starts now.

2215
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,200
Match my own face.

2216
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,640
Challenge failed

2217
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,800
Does this nose look like mine?

2218
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,840
Then which one is my nose?

2219
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,600
I...

2220
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,200
I'm totally confused

2221
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,840
Okay

2222
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,160
This isn't it either, is it? Is this one?

2223
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,760
Here, you find it for me

2224
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,840
I really don't know which one

2225
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,600
Eyes—these aren't yours

2226
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,680
These eyes aren't right

2227
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:37,560
No

2228
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,560
Then...

2229
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,720
Your eyebrows are wrong too.
The eyebrows aren't right either.

2230
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,120
The one you just put on

2231
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,280
should be Daxun's eyes.

2232
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,880
Yes, that's right.

2233
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,160
That's true, my brother Daxun.

2234
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,560
It really is.

2235
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,880
Congratulations, but the challenge failed.

2236
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,400
You’ve made more than five mistakes.

2237
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:52,880
Alright.
That’s unfortunate.

2238
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,840
This time’s bonus task

2239
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,360
was not completed successfully.

2240
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,200
I really can’t recognize myself.

2241
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,280
This is pretty good.
How cute is this!

2242
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,880
Then let’s get ready to start.

2243
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,360
Wait a moment.

2244
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:05,840
Ready, set.

2245
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,600
Okay.

2246
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,160
That's not right.

2247
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,080
That's not right.

2248
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,280
Whose nose is this?

2249
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,560
Thirty seconds left.
Alright.

2250
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,520
Are you sure this is the answer?

2251
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,120
Hold on a moment.

2252
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,080
Wait.

2253
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,400
Should we continue
or confirm this answer?

2254
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,120
Wait a moment.
Let me take a look.

2255
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,760
Then let's keep playing music.

2256
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,680
Alright, let's keep playing music.

2257
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,240
Congratulations on passing the test.

2258
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,480
I still don't recognize myself.

2259
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:18,920
Ready

2260
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,760
Which nose is mine?

2261
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,200
All the noses look pretty nice, actually.

2262
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,280
Which one?

2263
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,680
But my nose is quite big too.

2264
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,040
It should be this one.

2265
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:49,800
Are you sure?

2266
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,760
I'm sure.

2267
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,400
Congratulations, you completed the challenge!

2268
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,480
Who are the others?

2269
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,520
I want Dilraba's nose.

2270
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,160
Where is it?

2271
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,440
I want to try it.

2272
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,800
Is it this one?

2273
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,480
This is Mao Buyi's nose.

2274
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,120
Look, it actually suits you.

2275
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,360
Which one is Zhang Linghe's nose?

2276
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:12,520
This one.

2277
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,040
Zhang Linghe's nose.

2278
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,720
It looks okay for now, I guess.

2279
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,760
Then I'll start the countdown.

2280
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,440
Okay.

2281
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,000
This nose is way too hard to put together.

2282
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,680
I can't find the nose.

2283
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:14,760
It's done.

2284
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,880
Congratulations, you did it.

2285
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,360
Success.

2286
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:19,720
Start

2287
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,120
Are you sure about your answer?

2288
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,200
Of course it's correct.

2289
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,840
Correct answer.

2290
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,280
There are also benefits.

2291
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,920
Benefits, hurry.

2292
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,000
There are three types of benefits in total, but you can only choose one.

2293
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,120
Let's go with the snack shop.

2294
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,080
The snack shop, the pink one.

2295
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,040
I want the pink one.

2296
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,080
Props room, cafeteria, snack shop.

2297
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,840
Let's go with the props room.

2298
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,880
So you always carry something tasty with you, right?

2299
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,080
Then I'll carry with me...

2300
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,640
A big orange family bucket.

2301
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,920
I want to eat walnuts.

2302
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,560
Because I'm Zhang Linghe's little walnut.

2303
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,360
You can eat all of them, right?

2304
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,400
Perfect.
Great choice.

2305
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,720
Let's go with this one.

2306
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,040
Unlimited refills of energy-boosting water.

2307
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,000
I want to pick one.

2308
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,360
How about an early warning device?

2309
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,040
Guess what it is.

2310
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,520
It can sense danger ahead of time.

2311
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,840
Then an alarm will go off.

2312
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,880
Why is this called an early warning device? Explain.

2313
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,920
Because you can poke the road ahead with it.

2314
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,040
When it's dark,

2315
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,720
it helps you find your way.

2316
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,880
Alright, give it to me in a bit.

2317
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,480
I'm going to use this to hit Bai Yu later.

2318
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,280
Just wait and see how I give him a good beating.
