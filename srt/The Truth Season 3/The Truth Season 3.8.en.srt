1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,160
I'll give you one.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,440
Put it in your pocket.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,360
Or just hold it in your hand.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,120
Okay.
"Wasted purchase."

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,520
I'll use this on you later.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,480
I have a "stun baton."

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,160
Your "stun baton" isn't threatening at all.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,880
I just tried it.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
Is this some kind of operating table?

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,240
It's a claw machine.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
We're like the dolls being grabbed.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,600
You two look like old dads.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,560
Take a photo.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,720
Ning.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
Like this, sit here.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,240
I might have a problem with that later.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,320
Help me fix it.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Don't forget, you're Dr. He.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,760
Quick, check my pulse.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,880
Ba, check his pulse for him.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,960
What about me?

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
You only have one pulse.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,280
She's missing two pulses.
Passed down in one line.

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,600
Give it to us.
We'll do it ourselves.

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,560
Thank you.

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,280
Our Brother Liu's one-meter-long spicy strip.

27
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,040
Isn't this a bit too long?

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,440
Brother Liu paid for it.

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,320
You guys figure it out yourselves.

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,080
Brother Liu paid for it, so Brother Liu eats it.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Elderly people twisting their waists.

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,960
So it's left and right.

33
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
On Liuxing Street.

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,640
Here comes another one.

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,400
Come and learn, buddy.

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,640
We’re ready to make our debut, everyone.

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
This is your space.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
There are a lot of people coming and going in the factory.

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
People often get switched out.

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,120
So at this stage,

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,440
you don't have a roommate for now.

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,320
And here is your bed, right here.

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,560
These are some of your welding tools.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,000
And this is your locker.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,880
And your decorations.

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,680
There's also a basketball.

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,880
You also like to play basketball in here sometimes.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
This is the one I told you about.

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
The password.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,440
Helimo Jinyutang.

51
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,120
He will deliver this bag to you.

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,040
Prepare the "Helimo Jinyutang."

53
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,760
Send it over there, and he'll pack it up.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,639
Okay.

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Then I should do it this way.

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,640
At the beginning

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,800
we can keep busy here.

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Anything is fine.
Okay.

59
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
When you're packing here

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
air will spray out from inside.

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,640
Right from this opening.

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
Then, over here

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
cockroaches will fall down.

64
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Next, we need to turn this on.

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
When the conveyor belt starts

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
there will be an electric shock.

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
We will go one by one

68
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,520
into your room.

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
So, as soon as we enter our space

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
the first thing we do is let them come in.

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:33,880
Get an electric shock.

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm planning to take that glass slipper with me.

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
It's quite interesting, a bit tacky.

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
This is your only clue.

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
Today, this is all there is to my character.

76
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,840
There's a camp bed here, right?

77
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,600
Isn't this a bit too basic?

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,640
I saw others seem to have dorms or something.

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I'll just sleep on this.

80
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
That's fine.

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
My name is Ning Dengpao.

82
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
So that's why there are so many light bulbs in the room, right?

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,240
Did I scare you?
Sorry about that.
It startled me too.

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
There are a lot of light bulbs, aren't there?

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
It's nice, you put some thought into it.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Not bad.

87
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,800
This one.

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
You can use this to protect yourself.

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,920
That's so cool.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,200
That's good.

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,600
Very nice, thank you.

92
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,360
This dorm is so fancy.

93
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
This factory is really fancy too.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,320
This is what the boys' dormitory looks like.

95
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Where is my evidence?

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
There's a tablet here.

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Support sign

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,040
What is this?

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,400
A hula hoop.

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
This is a boxing device.

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,840
Which one is my bed?
This is my bed.

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,320
Don't sleep in my spot.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Got it.

104
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,640
You guys really didn't hide this very well.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,880
I put it in.

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
Don't take it out again.

107
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Yeah, I stuffed it in a bit.

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,560
Such important evidence.

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Come.

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,360
This Miyamoto Musashi

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,520
I am invincible.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,760
I am unbeat(en).

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,440
Wait a second.

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
I can already see inside.

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
How do I get back?

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,160
I don't want to go in.

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,840
If I go in, my whole look will be messed up.

119
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm still a

120
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,240
security guard with a strong idol image.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,600
Take care of all of them.

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,120
Whoever's lying there, I'll deal with them.

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
I'll make all five of them lie down.

124
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,920
Doesn't feel like anything.
Is it scary?

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,440
Not scary.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Alright.

127
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
I knew it.

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
During the first episode (the pilot),

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,200
everyone was actually pretty natural.

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
It felt more like everyday life.

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay, okay.

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,840
But once the recording started,

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Nice, your hair looks good.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
You look great, you look like someone today.

135
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Like a Disney princess.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,440
You even wore thermal underwear inside.

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,000
Sweater.

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,160
Sweater.

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
That wool sweater.

140
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,160
All of them look like they walked out of a comic book.

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
You have the nerve to talk about us?

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,320
You're the most handsome, seriously.

143
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm just wrapped up in a down jacket.

144
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
What are we doing here now?

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Nothing, just checking IDs first.

146
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
Checking IDs.

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,160
You two are suspects today as well, right?

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,040
Those shoes of yours scream "little assassin."

149
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,480
You're not, you're the detective, right?

150
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,080
He's the detective.

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,880
Here comes Bai Yu.

152
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,520
Looking sharp.

153
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Let's go.
Inside the cafeteria.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,840
I'll give you one.

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,120
Put it in your pocket.

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Or just hold it in your hand, it's fine.

157
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,760
Okay.

158
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,560
Bai, your style is really different today.

159
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,080
You shaved your beard.

160
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,160
No, I didn't.

161
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Yesterday you had it stuck on.

162
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Yeah.

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,600
I thought it was from your last role.

164
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
It was my real beard.

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
I shaved it.

166
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Why do we have to cook again?

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,760
Forget it, it takes three hours every time.

168
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,120
A Taste of Tuishi

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
There are people in my cafeteria.

170
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
Why are there so many people in my cafeteria?

171
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
So beautiful.

172
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm looking at you.
So beautiful.

173
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,080
You look like a waitress.

174
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,600
No.

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm looking at yours.
This looks nice.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
It's the same color as your blush.

177
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,920
Yeah.

178
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
I put on this blush just for this.

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
To match the blush.

180
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,400
Yeah, this feels right, doesn't it?

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,080
Looks good.

182
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,280
What about you?
You also have this.

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,680
What are you?
A little chef.

184
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,360
Yeah.
Do you need it?

185
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,160
Here you go.
Thank you.

186
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll open it for you, and then you can take it.

187
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Just hold it in your hand.
You're so nice.

188
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,680
Yesterday when I went back,

189
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
I praised you a lot to my staff.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
All us girls were saying,

191
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Among all of you,

192
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,160
if we had to choose someone to marry,

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,960
I said I recommend Liu Yuning to everyone.

194
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,720
Why?

195
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
Because no matter when,

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,360
you always speak so gently.

197
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,679
Soft and gentle.

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,159
That spoon...

199
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Why does it look like that green popsicle?

200
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll just have a "billion" spoonfuls.

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,040
This is a very important prop.

202
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,640
This is used to kill people.

203
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,200
Really?

204
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,560
One slap and they're dead.

205
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
What are you?

206
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,280
What are you?

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,320
He's an electrician.
Machinist.

208
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,160
He's an electrician.
Electrician.

209
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,760
What are you again?

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,440
You're the cook.

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Chef—look at that little apron.

212
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,120
So you have to cook here.

213
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,640
Right.

214
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,320
What about the younger brother?

215
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,000
I think he's on his way.

216
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Let's look at him like this.

217
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
Hurry, just look at him like this.

218
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Quick.
Strike a pose.

219
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Make a cold face.

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Like, "Why are you late? Not happy."

221
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,400
Cold face, quick.

222
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,280
Come on, Bai (Yu), hurry.
Stand here.

223
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,920
When he comes in, I'll take a picture of him.

224
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,400
Is he here?
Okay, come on.

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
All players and teachers, please

226
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,400
go to your starting positions.

227
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,680
It's over.

228
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,840
Then you can't really shock me later, bro.

229
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,920
I definitely will shock you.

230
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't do that.
No.

231
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,840
You're the victim, right?

232
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,680
Later, give him artificial...

233
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,960
I'll give you mouth-to-mouth.

234
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,600
Okay.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,760
You, the security guard.
I'm telling you, you...

236
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,440
You're in your own area now, right?

237
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,640
He's here.

238
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,480
"Wasted purchase"

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll use this on you in a bit

240
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,840
I have a stun baton

241
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
Your "stun baton" isn't threatening at all.

242
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
I just tried it.

243
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,760
But its electric shock doesn't even work.

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,320
Why aren't you doing anything?

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm watching the door.

246
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm not doing anything.

247
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,760
You're acting really suspicious today.

248
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Is this edible?

249
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
No wonder it had to be kept secret—it's delicious.

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,400
My job is to work with

251
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
The candy packer gazes through the window.

252
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,120
Okay.

253
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,240
Welding

254
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,280
Welding

255
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,880
You have already left your post

256
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,280
I order you to go back

257
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,080
When we came here just now,

258
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,840
was this thing here?

259
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Yes.
Yes.

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,360
What is this for?

261
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Something from the factory.

262
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Something from the factory.

263
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,560
It's not important, right?

264
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,120
So, have you talked it out?

265
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,520
Yes, we have.
We sorted it out a while ago.

266
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,480
My sense of justice is overflowing, you know?

267
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,720
My sense of justice has always been overflowing.

268
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,040
Alright.

269
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
You need to let it out.

270
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,440
I'll let it out.

271
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,280
Later, when I ask, just answer who I am.

272
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,920
No problem.

273
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,120
This is fun.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,760
You two can sit here.
Don't worry.

275
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,600
We'll sit here.

276
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
The two of us will sit there.

277
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,520
Okay.

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,600
What does that mean?
Should I sit on your lap?

279
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,760
No, you sit on that one.

280
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,320
You sit on that one.

281
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,880
He said two people.

282
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,440
You're overthinking it.

283
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,520
You even want to sit on my lap.

284
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
Might as well sit on my head or shoulders.

285
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,960
Alright.

286
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,440
Are you cold?

287
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,040
You're wearing so little.

288
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,720
If you're cold, wear a down jacket.

289
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,120
What about thermal pants?

290
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,280
I'm already wearing thermal pants.

291
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm wearing really thick ones.
Where am I supposed to be?

292
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,040
You should be over there.

293
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,680
I stand here, right?
Right.

294
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,720
Have you lost weight again?

295
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,440
I haven't lost weight, I've gained some.

296
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,640
I've gained weight.

297
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,640
I'm a little heavier than when we were filming.

298
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
I think you're thinner than you were back then.

299
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,680
And you've lost quite a bit.

300
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,920
I don't think so.

301
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
Maybe I was just swollen from being tired back then.

302
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,840
Maybe I was exhausted during filming.

303
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
So I looked puffy.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,800
Now I'm resting.

305
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,040
I've been able to rest up.

306
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,200
So I'm in better shape now.

307
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,200
Yesterday,

308
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
it looked like your chin was almost gone.

309
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,600
Maybe it's because of the beard.

310
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,280
Your legs are really long.

311
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
The design of your shoes—

312
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
it's all bumpy, right?

313
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,520
Yeah.

314
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,840
I thought it got squished by the bed.

315
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,920
Is this some kind of operating table?

316
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,960
It's a claw machine.

317
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,640
We're like the dolls being grabbed.

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
What claw machine?

319
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
A big claw machine.

320
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,600
It really is.

321
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
You two look like old dads.

322
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,960
Take a photo.

323
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,120
Ning.

324
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Like this, sit here.

325
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,240
And then take another one.
Don't look at the camera.

326
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,920
Look somewhere else.

327
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,960
In another direction.

328
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
With a sneaky look.

329
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,520
Mr. Bai, look over there.

330
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Three, two, one.

331
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,480
I feel sleepy after eating.

332
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Go back and sleep.

333
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,080
Go out and get some fresh air.

334
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,200
Get some fresh air.

335
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
I don't want to get fresh air.

336
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,120
I'm weak. Didn't you already check my pulse?

337
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,480
Let me tell you.

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
I get sleepy after eating.

339
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,640
Check my pulse again, hurry.

340
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm really not a Chinese medicine doctor.

341
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Today's pulse is the same as yesterday's.

342
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,240
No, what if I got better today?

343
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,920
That's impossible.

344
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Absolutely not.

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
Then tell me where it is.

346
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll monitor myself every day to see if I get better.

347
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,240
Look, this bone here.

348
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
Three fingers.

349
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
Place your middle finger here.

350
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Then line up your fingers and press down one by one.

351
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,480
Reading the pulse is actually about using your three fingers.

352
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,320
At different positions, you feel the strength of the pulse.

353
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,960
How do you think my kidneys are now?

354
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,880
I can't really feel it right now.
My hand is in an awkward position.

355
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,480
Why are you doing even worse today?

356
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,960
Is your heart the only thing working well today?

357
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah, only my heart is okay today.

358
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,120
Right, your liver energy is weak too.

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
My liver isn't doing well either.

360
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
Yesterday you said my kidneys weren't good.

361
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
Now my liver isn't good either.

362
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Help me, brother.

363
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
Maybe it's just from being tired.

364
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,680
Anyway, it's just a lack of energy and blood.

365
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,720
Then you’ll have to carry me for the rest of the recording.

366
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,880
I’m low on energy and blood too.

367
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
He can’t feel my pulse anymore, what should I do?

368
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
His hands are cold.

369
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,120
I’m doomed.

370
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,920
I’m going to faint.

371
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
I’m going to faint.

372
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,920
It’s just regular candy.

373
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280
This is soft-centered candy.

374
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,560
This is the kind of candy I gave you.

375
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,000
What’s wrong?

376
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,360
I’ll try one.

377
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
I might have a problem with that later.

378
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,040
Help me fix it.

379
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,920
There really is something wrong with this.

380
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,880
Don’t forget, you’re Dr. He.

381
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,000
I’m not Dr. He.

382
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,440
Doctor He

383
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
Please check my pulse quickly.

384
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,800
He really knows how to do it.

385
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
Check his health for him.

386
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Give him a checkup.

387
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,040
There won't be any problems.

388
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,960
Why?

389
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Wait a moment.

390
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,640
Why is it there and not here?

391
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
He is very healthy.
His pulse is very steady.

392
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
Ba, check his pulse for him.

393
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,120
I don't believe it.

394
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,440
Hers is steady too.

395
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,640
Very steady.

396
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,800
That's right.
She is healthy too.

397
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,280
No kidney deficiency, no spleen deficiency.

398
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,119
She is not weak, all three pulses are steady.

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,560
What about me?

400
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
You only have one pulse.

401
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,040
You only have one pulse.
She is missing two pulses.

402
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,560
Passed down in a single line.

403
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,000
How do you know all this?

404
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,760
How do you know all this?

405
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
He acts in films.

406
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,560
He played a traditional doctor and studied seriously.

407
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
Zhou Keyu

408
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,520
Your black robe

409
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
has revealed your identity as the murderer.

410
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
Alright.

411
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,360
Just as expected.

412
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
You all look so stylish, and I look so plain.

413
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,560
I'm plain too.
What's so stylish about this?

414
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,880
It's just regular "fur."

415
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,360
Yours is obviously for filming.

416
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,720
Yeah.

417
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,840
It's from the crew.

418
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,880
Are you guys wearing thermal pants?
We'll take off our thermals in a bit.

419
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm wearing them.
You're wearing them?

420
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,520
Yeah.
They're not thick, right?

421
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
Let me recommend one to you.

422
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
I'll recommend a pair of thermals.

423
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,440
They're really thin.

424
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,120
There's also a slightly thicker version.

425
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,520
It's pretty good.

426
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,920
No, that kind is fine.

427
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,240
You can just get them anywhere online.

428
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,520
The ones I bought before were like that.

429
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,160
I wore them in Northeast China at minus 25 degrees.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
The kind with electric heating.

431
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,040
No, the electric ones aren't useful.

432
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,560
The electric ones don't always get warm.

433
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
But the ones I bought were okay.

434
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,440
Do you work out?

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.

436
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,960
I gained six kilos in three months.

437
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,440
Muscle.

438
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
You don't look like you work out at all.

439
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,080
I do.

440
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm wearing such thick clothes, and you can still tell?

441
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
You must be really buff then.
Abs?

442
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,800
Really

443
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
What are you going to do?
I'm playing the general.

444
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
Does the general have to undress?
Take off your clothes.

445
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
When is it convenient to visit the set?

446
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,640
Let's go.

447
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,280
I want to be next to you.
Come hang out in my car.

448
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,560
You're absolutely right.

449
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,520
I don't have a car yet.

450
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,480
Still don't have a car.

451
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,320
What do you mean?
Can you drive?

452
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,840
She can't drive.

453
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Then learn.

454
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
No, she has a license.
She said it yesterday.

455
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,440
She said she once went out with her husband.

456
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,120
They went out driving.

457
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,200
Other people have husbands.

458
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,480
They're so happy.
Yeah.

459
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,360
They have a driver when they go out.

460
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,240
You all have no chance now.

461
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,640
Yeah.
She has a husband.

462
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,920
Gotta keep trying.

463
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
You can get by just making do.

464
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,280
What do you mean we have no chance?

465
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,960
No chance anymore.

466
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm already married and have kids.

467
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, so you have no chance, right?

468
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
You never thought about that at all, right?

469
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,240
No.

470
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,320
Not at all.

471
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,480
So what were you thinking?

472
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,280
He said,

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,560
Why is there no chance in my life?

474
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,720
The host has collected from various online creators

475
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
the ones most frequently used by fans

476
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,880
emoticons

477
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,120
and is sharing them here with everyone

478
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,440
This part is so sudden

479
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,600
It was love at first sight

480
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,480
Top supporter

481
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,000
Top supporter
Do you remember me?

482
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,240
I remember you.
You remember me.

483
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,320
I remember you.
You still remember me.

484
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,600
I remember you.
You haven't come to my livestream for a long time.

485
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,960
You still remember me.

486
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
I've been going to other people's livestreams lately.

487
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
I've been practicing sitting down lately.

488
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,800
Come here.
Sit down.

489
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,560
You came today

490
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,800
Shouldn't you support my business a bit?

491
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,680
Of course I should.
I definitely have to, right?

492
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,920
Bro
Of course, that's how it is.

493
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,280
These must be your friends.

494
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes.

495
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,360
We're all other streamers.

496
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,160
By this top supporter lady

497
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
She's our top supporter.

498
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
My top supporter loves opening cards the most.

499
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,280
We're all male streamers.

500
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Today's offline game goes like this.

501
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,560
As long as, in the livestream,

502
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,240
you open a complete set

503
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
of emoji packs of the six teachers,

504
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
then we can

505
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,520
pick the ones we want to take with us.

506
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,040
Sound good?
Sounds good.

507
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,080
Should I open it?
Open it.

508
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,040
Open it? Then you have to place an order for me.

509
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Place an order.
Place an order, like this.

510
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Come to my livestream later.

511
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
Send me a big rocket, okay?

512
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,240
I won't send you a big rocket.
I'll send you a little turtle.

513
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
Come on, let's open it together.
Come send a little turtle.

514
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,680
Thank you.
Thank you, big sis.

515
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,160
Send six little turtles.

516
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Congratulations, everyone.

517
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
You're really lucky.

518
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,440
Welcome to my livestream as a new user.

519
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,880
Thank you, host.

520
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,640
Alright.

521
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,160
Looks pretty generous.

522
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
Only took out a few turtles.

523
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,720
Okay, let's do it.

524
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,600
Everyone opens a little.

525
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,480
Open one, right?

526
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,680
You open it.

527
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,720
Each person opens two.

528
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,440
What's this?

529
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,600
Turned you all into "red bean paste."

530
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,360
Unmatched in the world.

531
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,280
That's all me.

532
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
"Cloud Feather," right?
Yes.

533
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,760
Back then, "Cloud Feather"...

534
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
Everyone already had theirs.

535
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,040
Had it, right?

536
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
Are there any other freebies?

537
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,040
Any other freebies?
So, top supporter,

538
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,360
Remember,

539
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,160
be sure to send a big rocket in my livestream.

540
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,400
Alright.
I remember you.

541
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I'll wait for you in my next livestream.
Okay.

542
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
Alright, thank you.

543
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,640
Let's eat spicy sticks.

544
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,200
Smells so good.

545
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, the aroma's been everywhere.

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,320
We also have here today

547
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,080
lots of fans and family members.
I really want to eat some.

548
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,880
Hello.

549
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
Hi.

550
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
You're the streamer who can handle spicy food, right?

551
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,080
That's right.

552
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
This one is called the Spicy Stick Slayer.

553
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:51,960
That's her.
Spicy Live Room.

554
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,560
You two should try a challenge.

555
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Here.
I want to eat this.

556
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,560
So delicious.

557
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,520
Which one tastes better?

558
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
Since you're here, eat a bit more.

559
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,600
Give it to us.
We'll do it ourselves.

560
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,320
We can help ourselves.

561
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,040
Let's have the fans here

562
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,160
try the challenge of eating a one-meter-long spicy snack.

563
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,680
How about it?

564
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,880
Thank you.

565
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
This is Liu's one-meter-long spicy snack.

566
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,160
Liu bought it.

567
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,040
You guys figure it out.

568
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,920
Liu bought it, so Liu eats it.

569
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
This is a bit too long, isn't it?

570
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Come on, eat it. Come on.

571
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,840
How do I eat this? I don't get it.

572
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
Just start eating from here.

573
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
Okay, you two straighten it out.

574
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
Come on.

575
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,120
Yes, eat it like this. That's right.

576
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
That's quite a lot.

577
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,200
Here.

578
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,720
We split it.

579
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,280
Come on.

580
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
That's great.

581
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,960
This is delicious.

582
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,560
Right?
The spicy one is tasty.

583
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
Tomorrow morning,

584
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,600
the six of us should get in touch first.

585
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
Let's agree on a time to go to the bathroom.

586
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,960
We'll be together nearby.

587
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,000
Thank you.

588
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
Do you all love eating this much?

589
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,760
It's okay.
You're still eating?

590
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,040
Mainly, we're just hungry.

591
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,320
Teach us, please.

592
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,200
Welcome, everyone.

593
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,840
All you handsome guys and pretty girls,

594
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,360
thanks for visiting the host's livestream.

595
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,360
I'll stay a bit farther from him.
He's going to ask me to dance in a bit.

596
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,200
In the past

597
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,680
This young man

598
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,320
Your pink hair

599
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,720
is really dazzling to me

600
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,960
How about we have a challenge?

601
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay
Come on

602
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,400
Then follow the host to learn the moves first

603
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,840
Alright

604
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,080
You're hiding too far away

605
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,680
Twist a little

606
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,040
Twist three times

607
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,360
Three

608
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,160
Then do "counting soldiers"

609
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,880
Then it's so hot, fan yourself

610
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
So hot, fan yourself

611
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Then listen to the sound of the waves

612
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,560
The sound of the waves

613
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
Has everyone learned it?

614
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,320
Let's all help this young man

615
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,400
Let's dance together, okay?

616
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay

617
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,080
You can watch me dance once first

618
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Elderly people twisting their waists

619
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,800
This

620
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,000
Isn't it supposed to twist like this?

621
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,200
This is way too hard.

622
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,880
How does he...

623
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,160
He needs to lift his hips, right?
Right.

624
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,960
Like this?
No.

625
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,520
Isn't it like this?

626
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,000
Aren't my hips moving pretty well?

627
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,640
Welcome, everyone

628
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,560
to all the new fans joining the livestream

629
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,080
Are you telling the truth or making it up?

630
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
It must be fake

631
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
What I say is definitely true

632
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm here myself to clear up the rumors

633
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,680
I know all the gossip about anyone you want to hear about

634
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,960
How do you know?

635
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Me? I just

636
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,080
I have connections in the industry

637
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,840
Name someone

638
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,320
I'll tell you

639
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
That "Love Security Guard"

640
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,160
Do you know "Love Security Guard"?

641
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:42,840
Yeah

642
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Love Security Guard

643
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,720
In our circle, we say

644
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,440
If you try to throw dirt on him

645
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,040
he'll just boil that dirt water

646
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
and throw it right back at you

647
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
So that's the kind of person Love Security Guard is

648
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,480
He'll argue with anyone and anything

649
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,560
Do you guys like Love Security Guard

650
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,440
this kind of personality?

651
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
This kind of person

652
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
If you don't like him, type "2"

653
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Brother Liu just sent you a tip
If you put it that way

654
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,360
Brother Liu sent you a tip, Brother Liu

655
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,120
I have another bit of gossip to share with you

656
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
Really? I want to hear it

657
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Yes, give the streamer a like.

658
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,360
Then the streamer will tell you.

659
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,200
Okay.

660
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,920
Thank you, thank you all for the likes.
Like.

661
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,200
Actually, the love security guard

662
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,040
also loves to gossip in private.

663
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
But he doesn't gossip with people.

664
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,520
He talks with his

665
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,280
dog at home.

666
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,320
Right.

667
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,840
So I think his dog

668
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,880
must know a lot about Hengdian's

669
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
secrets.

670
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,680
I think I could go

671
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
and steal his dog for you guys.

672
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,960
Steal it over.

673
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,520
Let's go.

674
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,240
Changing room.

675
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
We'll wait for you to finish changing.

676
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,840
Fans, darlings.

677
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,400
We'll be back in a bit.
Be right back.

678
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,800
Goodbye.

679
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,320
We're going to change clothes.

680
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,840
This looks so good in the photo.

681
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,720
It actually looks pretty nice.

682
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,800
What is this?

683
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,720
It's just a computer screen shot.

684
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,480
Looks great.

685
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
The lighting looks so good.

686
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,720
Bai, come here.

687
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,200
Let's take one together.

688
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Come on.

689
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,520
Stop looking.

690
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,320
Come on.

691
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,040
Three, two...

692
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Alright, let's go.

693
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,920
This picture quality is just like those old devices.

694
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,600
Old device picture quality.
Yeah.

695
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Let's go, time to head home.

696
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm here to practice dancing.

697
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,680
I haven't danced in a long time.

698
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,360
So I

699
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
want to learn that dance.

700
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,600
Yes, that's it.

701
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,320
This thing is such a hassle.

702
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,680
No need.

703
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,560
You're so serious.

704
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,360
Hurry.

705
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,400
Are you also good at dancing?

706
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Come on, let's do it together.

707
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:50,920
Almost.

708
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,000
Sure, it's very simple.

709
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,040
What about your solo one?

710
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,000
There's nothing much to see in the solo one.

711
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,920
What's with the solo one?

712
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,520
Did you practice?

713
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,320
No, I haven't.

714
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
Right, left, left

715
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
I'll help him remember the moves in a moment.
What kind of pose is that?

716
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,960
Where are we going?

717
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,440
Let's take a set of beautiful solo shots.

718
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,880
Everyone's already started practicing.

719
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Have you learned it yet?

720
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,880
That yangge dance of yours—
That's way too easy.

721
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
Just stand in front and we'll follow your lead.

722
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,520
Let's practice together.

723
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,080
Let's spar with each other.

724
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,160
Did you practice? Go back.

725
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,800
I didn't practice.

726
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Then practice with me now.

727
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,640
I didn't practice either.

728
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
Me neither.

729
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,040
Come on.

730
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,400
Hello, we are

731
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,600
Heitu Era.

732
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,080
Two, one, go!

733
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,680
How come you're dancing so badly yourself?

734
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,440
No, bro, don't blame me.

735
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,920
Have you memorized all the moves yet?

736
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm memorizing them right now.

737
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm almost done memorizing.

738
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,360
Just like that.

739
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,400
Three, two, one, we step with the left foot first.

740
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,520
Ready, go.

741
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

742
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,720
Right, left.
No.

743
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Left, right, left, right, then to the right again.

744
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,160
That's right.
Okay.

745
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,920
So it's left, right.

746
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,160
There's still something coming from Liuxing Street.

747
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,240
Hello, everyone.
Here comes another one.

748
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,040
How do you dance?

749
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,840
Come and learn, buddy.

750
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,160
He's a born idol.

751
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
No, do some breakdancing.

752
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
Three, four.

753
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,840
What is that? Wait a second.

754
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,000
What is that?

755
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,160
It's just...

756
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,880
It's just...
It's fine, I'll stand in the back.

757
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,360
I'll stand with Ning.

758
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,600
I'm even worse.

759
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
So handsome.

760
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
So pleasing to the eye.

761
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,480
One, two, three, four.

762
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,400
Come on, I can do it.

763
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Okay, no problem.

764
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
I've learned it.

765
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,960
You picked it up that quickly?

766
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
You said it yourselves.

767
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,440
I still have my own part.

768
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,440
You're not bad at this.

769
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
Not bad. It's actually pretty simple.

770
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,880
This is yours.

771
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
This move

772
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,640
One more time. Okay.

773
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
I didn't even recognize it.

774
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Which one do you want to watch?
Come on, let's do ours.

775
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,000
Let's rehearse ours.
Do we even need to rehearse ours?

776
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,040
Ours is way too easy.

777
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,320
Really?

778
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,400
Just me.

779
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,680
Brother Bai.
It's time for the catwalk.

780
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,080
Go ahead.

781
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,640
Nine.

782
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,200
You two dance this one.

783
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,360
I'll go with that person.

784
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,920
He'll go with Bai Yu.
Bai Yu.

785
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Ba

786
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,040
Ba, so beautiful.

787
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I saw it over there just now.

788
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
You really look like that person today.

789
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,280
You really do.

790
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
"Cleopatra"

791
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
Someone in the group live was Cleopatra.

792
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,720
You've seen it, right?

793
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,200
I've seen it.

794
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,360
This transformation, right.

795
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,640
What are you doing, Zhang Linghe?

796
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm learning to dance.

797
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,520
You're dancing to this?
No, I'm dancing to the previous one.

798
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,920
You might as well do the one everyone dances together.

799
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,440
Yeah, let's practice the group one together.

800
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,280
Super beautiful golden spoon.

801
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,080
Thank you, thank you to my family.

802
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,200
Thank you, baby.

803
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,560
Thank you, XL's baby.

804
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,560
Come on.

805
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,360
You stand in front first, show them.

806
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,239
We are

807
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,920
Black Soil Era.

808
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,480
One, two, three.

809
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,639
Come on, Zhang Linghe, come on.

810
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,520
One, two, three, four.

811
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,320
Five, six, seven, eight.

812
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,000
Right, left.

813
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,000
One, two, three, go.

814
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,800
From Six Star Street, you can still hear

815
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,320
guitar playing

816
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,679
and bayan accordion music, right?

817
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,440
We're so in sync.

818
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,199
Better than X.

819
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,040
We can debut now, everyone.

820
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,360
Is it over already?

821
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,120
Not at all, it's still early.

822
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,600
We're only halfway done, half is still left.

823
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,320
Next, come on.

824
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,160
Hello, everyone.

825
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,240
We are Heitu Era.

826
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,440
Listen, playing the piano.

827
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,320
Finger

828
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,520
I'm really familiar with this now.

829
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,400
Twist

830
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,680
Butt

831
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,360
Alright, we're ready.

832
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,800
Come on.

833
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,960
How should we stand?

834
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,680
How should we stand?

835
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,920
We can just walk however, right?
Those four will follow behind.

836
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,120
Okay, let's go.

837
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,440
How about we play some background music ourselves?

838
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,920
Let's hit the beat.

839
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,520
Feels so dry.
You sing.

840
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,840
What do you want to hear? You pick one.

841
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
Is "Stay With Me" okay?

842
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,040
So slow.

843
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,440
I'm getting hyped.

844
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,600
We need a fan in front.

845
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,560
No, we need a big light behind us.

846
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,800
Right, shine a strong backlight.

847
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,080
We're not models.

848
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,800
We're actually just relaxed.

849
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,120
So how do we set the rhythm?

850
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,400
If it's this rhythm, how do we do it?

851
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,440
How do we do it?

852
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,080
Just the walking rhythm.

853
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,200
How do six people keep the same pace?

854
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,200
No, they'll slow it down in post-production.

855
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,480
Can you play another upbeat song?

856
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,160
Let me listen.
A slow song is...

857
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,440
It's the kind that can...

858
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,800
This world has...

859
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,600
This kind.

860
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,520
The kind you can step to.

861
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,440
It's just more...

862
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,680
Stronger rhythm, right?

863
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,760
Okay.

864
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,880
I'll give it a try.

865
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Search for runway.
Yeah.

866
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,120
Runway.

867
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,600
Runway background music.

868
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
Like when you see those models.

869
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
Walking with their arms not moving, right?

870
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,800
The whole haute couture.
Exactly the same.

871
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,920
We're going to walk for this brand.

872
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,720
That's right.

873
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,000
No.

874
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,200
Is she hunched over like this?

875
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,040
Yes, her hands don't move.

876
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,920
Don't look up.

877
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,720
Keep your head steady.

878
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,720
Your legs must be fast, pick up the pace.

879
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
Are we walking the runway,

880
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,240
or are we walking together?

881
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,680
The runway.

882
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Then it's the runway, that's settled.

883
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,600
I'll go first.

884
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,360
Are we really going to showcase this haute couture outfit?

885
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,320
What I mean is,
Bro, it's just that—

886
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
At the start, we stand in a line.
You're at the very front.

887
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,840
No.

888
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
You're blocking all of us.

889
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,840
After taking a couple of steps,

890
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,600
That's cool.

891
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,920
There's a bit of change, you know what I mean?

892
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,360
That works.

893
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,480
Let's go with your suggestion on this.

894
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,680
Let's do a rehearsal.

895
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It seems like we're missing one person.
If we go by that plan,

896
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,040
It doesn't matter.
No need.

897
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,480
As long as we can spread out, it's fine.

898
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,560
We just need to spread out.

899
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
One-two-three, one; one-two-three, one.

900
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,560
We don't need to split into two groups.

901
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,080
Let's all spread out at once.

902
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,840
Then walk forward side by side.

903
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,560
Spread out all at once.
I think his way—

904
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,000
Like a swarm of wasps.

905
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,560
Let's try it.

906
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,280
No need to try, just do it directly.

907
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,440
Just go for it.

908
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,040
Just do it.
Let's just do it.

909
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,040
One, two, three, go.

910
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,000
Two, two, three, go.

911
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,440
Here they come.
Right.

912
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,680
Those three go first.

913
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,880
Okay, one, two, three, go.

914
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,640
Go.

915
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,240
Go.

916
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,560
Wait, Dilraba's legs are too long.

917
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Do you feel that way?

918
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,400
Walk a bit faster.

919
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,960
Where are you going?

920
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,360
Are you going to the market?

921
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,560
What are you doing?

922
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,960
Then let's all scratch our heads, okay?

923
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,840
Everyone scratch your head.

924
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,800
Scratch your head.

925
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,240
Telling you, you're scared now.

926
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,280
You should still look confused.

927
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,640
Three, two, one.

928
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,040
Tie theirs tighter.

929
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,480
Tie mine looser.

930
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
Tie his tighter for me.

931
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,520
Brother Daning, hurry and save us!

932
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Kewuku.
Stand up.

933
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,320
Should we stand up?

934
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,360
Do we really have to stand up?

935
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,560
I'm standing up.

936
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,200
I'm up.

937
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,400
You can stand up.

938
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
Your body fat is pretty low.

939
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,400
Because when I pinch it, it's just a thin layer.

940
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,360
I was actually pretty scared at first.

941
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,160
It suddenly hurt a lot, so I jumped out.

942
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,480
So you, as a Capricorn,

943
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,520
why are you different from the two of us?

944
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,320
You two, in the dark,

945
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,920
do you also like to pinch people like this?

946
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,120
Yes, I do.

947
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,000
Actually, you can do it like this.

948
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
Take a photo with your arms crossed.

949
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,160
Right.

950
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Let's pile up together a bit.

951
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,840
Together, we're a ball of fire.

952
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,360
Apart,

953
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,280
we're just a bunch of matches.

954
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,600
Legs are 8.5 meters long.
