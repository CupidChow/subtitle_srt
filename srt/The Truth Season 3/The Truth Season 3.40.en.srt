1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,160
This game has failed.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,440
The real culprit is

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,720
from the Koban background.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,720
I am his X.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm not really from the Kerban family.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,040
The stories I told

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,360
all came from his diary

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
and what I learned from the scene.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,760
Everything I did

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,880
was to impersonate him.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
My name is Penyou.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm 23 years old.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,560
My dream is to become a director.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,760
I grew up in an orphanage.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,640
I learned early on

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,080
an important lesson about survival.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,760
Be sensible, obedient, and always say yes.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,400
Only then would people want to be friends with me.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,480
But as I got older,

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,680
I gradually became confused

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
about these kinds of relationships.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,680
On the Tuixiaoba forum,

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,240
I met Golden Circle Princess.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,400
She was lively and talkative.

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,880
Soon, our conversations

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,840
went from academics to everyday life.

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,440
I changed my forum ID

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,040
to Golden Friend.

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
Besides Golden Circle Princess,

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,480
I also met Tuihao on the forum.

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
He was someone with low self-esteem.

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,080
So I kept encouraging him to believe in himself.

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,000
I received

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
an acceptance letter from the Tuiyi directing department.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,319
I was one step closer to my dream.

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Golden Circle Princess told me

37
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880
she also got into Tuiyi.

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,000
She even got her driver's license.

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,560
She excitedly asked to meet me in the evening.

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
She said she wanted to drive me to Tiebu Mountain for a ride.

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,960
That's great!

42
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,640
I can finally meet my good friend.

43
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,360
I brought promotional flyers for Tuiyi to Tiebu Mountain.

44
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
I met Princess Jin.

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
But I didn't expect

46
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,120
that while she was driving me around,

47
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,360
an accident happened.

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
From the dark woods,

49
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
a shadowy figure suddenly appeared.

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
Jin lost control of the speed.

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,440
That person was hit by the car and fell off the cliff.

52
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Our car also went out of control.

53
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
It crashed through the guardrail

54
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
and hung on the edge of the cliff.

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,640
Jin quickly jumped out the window to save herself.

56
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,360
Just as I was calling to her for help,

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
the car rolled down the cliff.

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,080
The car body absorbed

59
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,760
part of the impact from the fall.

60
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,000
I endured the pain and crawled out of the car.

61
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Fortunately,

62
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
there was a factory nearby.

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,160
The lights were still on on the third floor.

64
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,680
Someone was probably working overtime.

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,960
I wanted to go there to find someone to call for help.

66
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840
But just as I reached the bottom of the factory building,

67
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
I passed out.

68
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,400
When I woke up again,

69
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I found myself lying on a camp bed.

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,360
A young boy was sitting by my bedside.

71
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,800
He said I had been unconscious for an entire night.

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
He was the one who saved me outside the factory.

73
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,960
Now my face and vocal cords were badly injured.

74
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
I needed to rest and recover.

75
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
Since I couldn't speak,

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
I took out my sketchbook.

77
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
I drew and wrote questions to communicate with him.

78
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,000
He said his name was Aguai.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Because his father was very strict,

80
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
he wasn't allowed to take in outsiders.

81
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,000
So he secretly hid me in his secret base.

82
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,080
Over the next period of time,

83
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Aguai and I gradually became friends.

84
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,240
I also told him what had happened to me.

85
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
I told him everything.

86
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
I suddenly fell asleep again.

87
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,960
When I woke up, I was lying in an unfamiliar room.

88
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,480
There was also a wristband on my arm.

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,360
In front of me,

90
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
stood a stern-looking middle-aged man.

91
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,920
He spoke to me harshly.

92
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
It seemed he was Aguai's father.

93
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,960
He even mistook me for Aguai.

94
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,160
But I couldn't make a sound.

95
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,240
I was weak all over.

96
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,080
I could only try to explain with awkward gestures.

97
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,760
But he just locked me in here.

98
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,960
He completely ignored me.

99
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
The next day,

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Aguai's father performed surgery on me.

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,560
Because of the painkillers for my recovery,

102
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,880
I often drifted in and out of sleep.

103
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Aguai's father rarely came by.

104
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Sometimes he would give me injections.

105
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,760
Whenever he appeared,

106
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
I would try to explain to him.

107
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,960
But Agui's father thought I was just talking nonsense.

108
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,160
He even said I was making it up to avoid getting an injection.

109
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
That I was making up all sorts of crazy stories as an excuse.

110
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
He told me to shut up.

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,560
Since I couldn't reason with Agui's father at all,

112
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,280
I could only look for a chance to escape on my own.

113
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,160
Gradually, my body healed.

114
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
After I removed the bandages, I discovered

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
that I had actually turned into Agui.

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,480
So Agui's father

117
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,200
mistook me for Agui, who had accidentally disfigured himself.

118
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,840
He even restored my appearance.

119
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Suddenly, I understood.

120
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
When Agui saved me back then,

121
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,360
it wasn't out of kindness at all.

122
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,080
It was so I could take his place

123
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
and stay trapped in this cage.

124
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,240
I treated him as a friend,

125
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
but he used me.

126
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
He sacrificed my life for his own freedom.

127
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
I must take revenge.

128
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
I wrote these words down

129
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
to constantly remind myself.

130
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
Yesterday, while looking for something,

131
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
I accidentally lifted the bed board.

132
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,560
I didn't expect the bed could turn into a ladder.

133
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
And the ladder led directly to

134
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
the secret base where I first woke up.

135
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,600
To avoid being discovered by A-Guai's dad,

136
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
I quickly put the bed and ceiling back to normal.

137
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440
In the secret base,

138
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
I found A-Guai's laptop.

139
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,160
After logging into the TuiXiaoBa forum on the computer,

140
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,760
I realized that today is April 22, 2025.

141
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
On the wall of the secret base,

142
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
I found a hole.

143
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,480
It seems A-Guai escaped from here back then.

144
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
Climbing down through the hole led to an elevator.

145
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
After climbing out,

146
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,200
I covered the hole with the original poster.

147
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,960
Then I took the elevator to the first floor.

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
The factory was already

149
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
completely different from what I remembered.

150
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,640
It looked like a grand event was about to be held.

151
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,400
Wearing a hospital gown made me stand out too much.

152
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
To hide my tracks,

153
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,000
I took the chance to steal a set of clothes when no one was around.

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
I put the hospital gown I took off

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
into a locker.

156
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
I also ran into someone.

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
After asking around, I found out

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
this place is the foot of Tiebu Mountain.

159
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
A film and television company has opened nearby.

160
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
There's also a boot camp set up next to it.

161
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,640
I saw someone

162
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
who looked exactly like me.

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
He also came here.

164
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
That was Aguai.

165
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,840
Looking at that face,

166
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
years of suppressed hatred erupted at that moment.

167
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Five years of imprisonment

168
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
were all thanks to him.

169
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,240
I want to take everything from him.

170
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Kill him and take his place.

171
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,360
To find a chance to get close to Aguai,

172
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,760
I secretly followed him.

173
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,840
I discovered that he was being controlled by Tui Baiyi, who knew his secret.

174
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
He even used this abandoned warehouse

175
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,960
to set up traps to kill people.

176
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
Aguai came near the red carpet area of the factory.

177
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
I knocked him out when he wasn't expecting it.

178
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I dragged him to the ruined hole by the first-floor elevator.

179
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,680
In Aguai's bag,

180
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,040
there was a detailed diary.

181
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,160
I learned everything that happened to him after he escaped in 2020.

182
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
All the things that happened.

183
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
He used the Tu万能 black market.

184
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,160
He bought a new identity and an admission letter to Tu艺.

185
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,960
He pretended to be an orphan to enroll at Tu艺.

186
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
He was a student in the acting department.

187
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Not only at school,

188
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
he also had a passionate romance.

189
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,040
He won the Tu艺 Star award.

190
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
He became an outstanding graduate of Tu艺.

191
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
He even became an actor.

192
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,360
I put my extra's costume on him.

193
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
And changed into his clothes.

194
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
Unexpectedly, Aguai suddenly woke up.

195
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,360
He tore off the electronic wristband from my hand.

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
I picked up a steel bar from the ruins.

197
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,360
And stabbed Aguai to death.

198
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
I destroyed his face.

199
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
I burned the notebook he carried in a metal barrel.

200
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
And also burned Aguai's bag.

201
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,120
I covered the entrance to the ruined hole

202
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
with rubble.

203
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,000
That way, no one would find Aguai's body.

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Absolutely foolproof.

205
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
I pretended to be Aguai.

206
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,800
At the makeup table where Keban used to sit,

207
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
I saw that they were supposed to gather at 12:30.

208
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,560
I took off my ring.

209
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,440
I quickly did my makeup and rushed to the meeting.

210
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,560
I told myself I saw Aguai kill someone.

211
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
But I had to hide myself well.

212
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Deal with things as they come.

213
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,280
Only then could I

214
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,400
start a new life cleanly.

215
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
This is my ring mark.

216
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,160
He already looks just like me.

217
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,840
I’m the one who let him down.

218
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
My life is almost over.

219
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,560
I can’t hurt him again.

220
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
He can’t be found out.

221
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,240
This is what I can do for you.

222
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
It’s the last thing.

223
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,200
I’m sorry.

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
I honestly have no words for you guys.

225
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Why are you doing this to me?

226
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,280
Oh no, I just licked it.

227
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Now it's stuck on there.

228
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,559
Can I pull it off with my hand?

229
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,200
There's only one left, let's just pick her.

230
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,680
And actually, I think

231
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,160
if it were someone else,

232
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
I probably wouldn't choose them.

233
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,960
But I'm a little afraid of this person.

234
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Because I'm kind of wary.

235
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
So I think it's safer to choose her.

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,960
I also want to see how she plays X.

237
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
What kind of state she'll be in.

238
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't choose X this round.

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,120
First, because there's only one.

240
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Investigator.

241
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
I didn't want to put pressure on a single investigator.

242
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,920
Because I've been the only investigator once.

243
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,840
Honestly, I felt a lot of pressure.

244
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
Second, I wanted to say

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
I wanted to try it myself.

246
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,200
To see if there's a way to successfully

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,080
change the outcome.

248
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
Make everyone believe I'm not the culprit.

249
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,280
When you guys had only one investigator before,

250
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
was he definitely X, or...

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:48,800
That round,

252
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,360
I was.

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,600
It was a bit special.

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Because if you remember that round,

255
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
everyone chose her as X.

256
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah.

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
The culprit didn't know they were the culprit.

258
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Did you forget? You even wrote me a note.

259
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,960
No, she was definitely X.

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,960
Because I believe

261
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,640
in the eyes of the killer, she

262
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
if she isn't chosen as X,

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
she's a threat.

264
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,640
I'm a little afraid of this person.

265
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,880
Because I'm rather wary.

266
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Are you X?

267
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Are you X?

268
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm not.

269
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Impossible.

270
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,760
I really am not.

271
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Impossible.

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,720
Really not.

273
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,800
I really am not.

274
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,360
Okay.

275
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
When you were before

276
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
If someone is the detective,

277
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,080
is he definitely X, or is it him?

278
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,880
Not necessarily.

279
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,840
Not necessarily, it depends on the situation.

280
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
She's so serious.

281
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,520
If she's not, then I think she

282
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah, she would act it out.

283
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,880
She wouldn't be this serious.

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
No, I really am not.

285
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,800
She is.

286
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
She's a bit serious.

287
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
You're a bit nervous, sis.

288
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
If you are, then you are. It doesn't matter.

289
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,800
It's not her.

290
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,760
You haven't done it before, right?

291
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
I've never been the detective before.

292
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,960
Then how do we judge her current behavior?

293
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,520
What I mean is, in this game,

294
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
if you're X, just admit it.

295
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
It's not a big deal.

296
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,560
So right now, whether you are or not,

297
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
we'll just assume you are.

298
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,000
Right.

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,720
Do you understand?

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,480
I understand.

301
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,400
Because the person was found in the stairwell.

302
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,160
The body.

303
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
This is different from what I remember.

304
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,480
The way he died is a bit different.

305
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,040
So,

306
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,920
I want to observe a bit more.

307
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,840
And communicate with my X again.

308
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
Because I only have one chance.

309
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,560
I want to

310
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,560
wait until we search for evidence again

311
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,440
and investigate what happened.

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
Then I'll have this conversation.

313
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,800
So, you're X today, right?

314
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm not X.

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Actually, I think today's game isn't easy to play either.

316
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Because it's really strange.

317
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
I don't know if you believe me, but I'm not X.

318
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,480
Then this game,

319
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,120
it must have a lot of setups.

320
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,720
It's not like the previous episodes anymore.

321
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
It's not that simple now.

322
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,200
There might even be a twist at the end.

323
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,640
But if you're not X,

324
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,280
then it's really hard for the culprit.

325
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,960
So there must be a special way to play for them.

326
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,360
It's basically one against five.

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
Four good guys plus one X.

328
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,680
No, not the detective.

329
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
And the detective is you.

330
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,520
It's tough for that person.

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
So there are two culprits.

332
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,520
I guessed yesterday that it would be the same.

333
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,760
So one detective has to find two culprits?

334
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,520
Aren't I still with the good guys?

335
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,920
That's true.

336
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
But what if there's a confused good guy?

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,400
But don't you think

338
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,120
don't you think if I were the detective

339
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,000
and also X,

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,840
and people think

341
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,760
I'm good at reasoning,

342
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,200
wouldn't that make it too easy for the culprit?

343
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
I have my doubts.

344
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,920
Who is in first place for the Golden Key now?

345
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
Ke Yu.

346
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,880
That's right, you're first.

347
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Then one, two, three, four.

348
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,320
We're the same.

349
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,040
The four of us are

350
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,600
second.

351
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,880
She's third.

352
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,400
She's last.

353
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,000
You have the least.

354
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,840
So you're crucial this round.

355
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
If you're X,

356
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
then you might win this round.

357
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Right, she's going to win today.

358
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm really a clown.

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm such a clown.

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,120
I don't want to win anymore, I've already given up.

361
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,520
Because I've already lost too much.

362
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,280
It's okay.

363
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,440
What you've lost, I'll help you get back today.

364
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
He wants to help you get it back.

365
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,200
That's right.

366
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
This person is coming back to kill you.

367
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,880
And someone wants to protect you.

368
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,200
Who wants to protect me?

369
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,840
The answer is obvious.

370
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,480
Then there's only one, this one.

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
Who else?

372
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
Who wants to protect me?

373
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,200
That lovesick fool.

374
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Yesterday was the killer.

375
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
Today, the killer again.

376
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
You never learn.

377
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
Just how much do you love me?

378
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Who else? Who loves me?

379
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,880
Actually, I don't love you.

380
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,600
Just kidding.

381
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll just lock in the culprit.

382
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,240
No.

383
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,000
You don't.

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,880
There's definitely something off with this logic right now.

385
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
There are some flaws in it.

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,640
Okay, I'll deduce.

387
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,120
Everyone, close your eyes.

388
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,600
Okay.

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,160
Close them.

390
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,240
The person who knocked on the wall, open your eyes secretly.

391
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
I won't say, okay?

392
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,880
I won't tell, alright?

393
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,640
Alright.

394
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Okay.

395
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,400
Only she knows.

396
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,600
Only I know.

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,720
I won't say.

398
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay, three.

399
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,040
Two.

400
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,640
One.

401
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,840
Open your eyes.

402
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,080
What does that mean?

403
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,280
So that person has already opened their eyes, right?

404
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,120
Okay.

405
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,480
Is it okay now?

406
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,560
Alright, open your eyes.

407
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,760
Is it done now?

408
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,280
No one opened their eyes.

409
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,680
No one would open them.

410
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,480
She's protecting that person, I know.

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,040
I know who it is.

412
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
Bai Yu

413
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,400
Or Liu Yuning

414
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
But not like Zhou Keyu

415
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,560
It can't be Bai Yu

416
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,160
Because he would never

417
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
let the two smartest people team up

418
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,240
That would make the game no fun

419
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
If it were Bai Yu, it really wouldn't be fun

420
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,880
I think it should be Zhang Linghe or

421
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,480
or Liu Yuning

422
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,680
If it's me and Liu Yuning, it's no fun either

423
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
He's too good at controlling the pace

424
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,520
It must be Zhang Linghe

425
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,880
Or one of Zhou Keyu

426
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,280
Zhou Keyu

427
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,480
It really is Zhou Keyu

428
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Zhou Keyu told me

429
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
He added another thing, he said

430
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,160
He wants you to say it

431
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,840
She called me.

432
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
Can you answer the phone?

433
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
I've recorded so many episodes of this show.

434
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,680
Over these two seasons,

435
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
this is the first time X Communication has let me make a call.

436
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,960
Yeah, because I have so much to say

437
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
that I want to tell you.

438
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,560
Alright.

439
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,600
Let me tell you, here's how it is with Ba in a bit.

440
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll say that I'm actually Ba's X.

441
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,240
But later I found out

442
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,120
that Ba isn't the real culprit.

443
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,440
So I kept hinting for her to jump quickly.

444
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,400
I used the "close your eyes" method.

445
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,080
With her,

446
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,320
while everyone was closing their eyes,

447
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,800
I told her to jump, but she still wouldn't (agree).

448
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,040
Because she thought

449
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,079
if she wasn't the real culprit,

450
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,400
she wouldn't have been chosen as X.

451
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,920
Since she was chosen as X,

452
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
she must be the real culprit.

453
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,839
She told me she wouldn't jump.

454
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,560
Alright, so I respected her decision.

455
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,599
That's my thought process.

456
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
Pretty detailed, right?

457
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,400
Okay, sure, if you say so.

458
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,240
But I think

459
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,640
Not everyone will fully believe these things.

460
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,079
If

461
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,640
Because after all, it's just one side of the story.

462
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
And she happened to leave right then.

463
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,119
That's too many coincidences.

464
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,960
Someone like Lao Bai will definitely be suspicious.

465
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,120
If he gets suspicious,

466
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
you'll just follow Lao Bai and go against me.

467
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,160
Don't worry about it.

468
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,280
As long as we don't

469
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
form a clear alliance, it's fine.

470
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
I get you.

471
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,120
Yeah.

472
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Okay.

473
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Alright.

474
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,920
So what I was thinking just now is

475
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,760
we don't need to

476
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
make our alliance too obvious,

477
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,920
but we also don't need to make it obvious that we're not allied.

478
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
We should just go with

479
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,640
the points everyone brings up

480
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,480
and follow their lead.

481
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,720
For example, if they want to target someone,

482
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,920
then we can decide what to do.

483
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,440
That's it—just play it by ear.

484
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,240
No need for us to start something ourselves.

485
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,320
Right.

486
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
But I might also

487
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,440
go hard against you.

488
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,800
But I'll see how things go.

489
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,840
What I want to tell you

490
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,560
is that this is the thing to be careful about.

491
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,120
What I want to tell you

492
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
is that this is the thing to be careful about.

493
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,720
It's just that

494
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
if you really go hard against me...

495
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,080
If they really bring the ticket type over,

496
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
it'll be a big problem.

497
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Because you don't know

498
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,520
what the situation will be later,

499
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,400
whether there will be

500
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,080
enough strong evidence to refute you.

501
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,120
There's no evidence at all, it's all about appearances.

502
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,960
Stop thinking of yourself as the culprit.

503
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Just treat this as

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
the script for the leading role in your next job.

505
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,760
No.

506
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,920
No, I know.

507
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
I just mean,

508
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,440
I just mean to say,

509
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,160
if you bring everyone over

510
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
and all come at me at once,

511
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,320
it might be a little risky.

512
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Because if I

513
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
if there are too many people,

514
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
I might not be able to talk my way out, you know?

515
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,000
Let me tell you, here's the thing.

516
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,520
If everyone believes I'm not X,

517
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,520
then I'll go after Zhang Linghe.

518
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,200
I'll lead the direction.

519
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,480
But if everyone is sure

520
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,400
that you are definitely X,

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,560
and that you must be the real culprit,

522
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,480
then I'll target you.

523
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,200
Because if they decide I'm X,

524
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
the person I target

525
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,880
they'll definitely think isn't the culprit.

526
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
So I'll play it by ear too, you know?

527
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
Okay, sure.

528
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
Then let's set a code word between us.

529
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,080
Because we have to vote at the end.

530
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,680
We can't communicate anymore before the vote.

531
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,560
Okay.

532
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
So if I need to vote for someone later,

533
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,000
keep your voice down.

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
if I need to vote for someone later,

535
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
I'll just say I definitely won't vote for him.

536
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,360
But I

537
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,000
in my heart

538
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520
I definitely wouldn't vote for him.

539
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,560
So you know who I voted for.

540
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,320
It must be that person.

541
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,240
Okay.

542
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,880
Alright.

543
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,480
Okay.

544
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
Then, when the time comes, you can

545
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,840
emphasize this sentence more.

546
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,760
Yes, okay.

547
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,160
Sure, okay, let's do it that way.

548
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Goodbye.

549
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,680
Okay.

550
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Perfect.

551
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
Finally, I can get a key, right?

552
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,440
I guess

553
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,920
someone opened their eyes in that game just now.

554
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
It was Aba, right?

555
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,400
Yes.

556
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,680
She was the one knocking on the wall, right?

557
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,440
Yes.

558
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,880
So she was the killer.

559
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,480
I knew she was the killer all along.

560
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,760
Because I was the X she chose for this case.

561
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,040
Hurry up and explain.

562
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,520
What were you doing yesterday at 12:15 p.m.?

563
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,760
At twelve o'clock, I

564
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,320
was

565
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,520
in the bathroom

566
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,440
taking care of my mouth.

567
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,480
You're lying, I didn't see you.

568
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
You're lying, I didn't see you.

569
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,120
You were in the bathroom too.

570
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Yes.

571
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,080
I had diarrhea from twelve to twelve thirty.

572
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't see you either.

573
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,280
Wait.

574
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,640
It's a classic either-or situation.

575
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,080
Classic either-or.

576
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,880
From twelve to twelve thirty

577
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
I was resting in the break room

578
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
I even took some time to practice my lines

579
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
I even took some time to practice my lines

580
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,520
I was in the restroom over here

581
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,960
I didn't hear you practicing your lines

582
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,440
I mean the kind of line practice where you speak quietly

583
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
I was practicing the kind where

584
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,560
the lines are like this

585
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,600
Of course you couldn't hear me

586
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
What I was practicing was

587
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160
for when I play a spy in the future

588
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,600
how to pass secret messages

589
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
From twelve to twelve thirty

590
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,520
I was filming a video for Ba at the foot of Tiebu Mountain

591
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400
You two can confirm each other's alibi

592
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,440
Ba and I can confirm each other's alibi

593
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,440
So he's already been ruled out?

594
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Yes, you've been ruled out

595
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Okay

596
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,360
This round will be our highlight

597
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,760
Liu Yuning

598
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
I've waited too long for this moment

599
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,240
Today, we'll join forces

600
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Let's catch this culprit, okay?

601
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,480
Our team will be called "Ning Jing"

602
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,360
"Ning Jing"

603
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,480
"Ning Jing"

604
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
Because Jin Pengyou was

605
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,560
in that secret room for these four years,

606
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
he actually had no contact with us

607
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,280
or with the studies at Tuizhen Art Academy.

608
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,040
Right, the studies.

609
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
He has no idea at all

610
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,280
how to be an actor.

611
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,600
And then,

612
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,480
after he came out,

613
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,400
he was already at

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
the selection competition venue.

615
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,360
So what does he need to do?

616
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,960
What does he need to do?

617
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,840
All his actions after twelve o'clock

618
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,480
must be different from before.

619
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,040
Because he got something for an actor,

620
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,640
something about what an actor should do.

621
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Like, if I go to audition for this play,

622
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,320
I just need to know how to do push-ups,

623
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,960
just need to glare with wide eyes, that's enough.

624
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,480
I want to ask,

625
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
so he never went to school,

626
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,000
he never studied acting,

627
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,920
he doesn't know how to act.

628
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,960
He's right.

629
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
Yes, the one who's here right now.

630
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
That killer, Jin's friend.

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
He has no acting talent.

632
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
He doesn't even know what an actor is supposed to do.

633
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,560
What he just said reminded me of something.

634
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,280
Go ahead.

635
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,840
It's just that we...

636
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,560
are also dealing with this personality-switching thing.

637
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,120
Let's suppose

638
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,000
after this person switches back,

639
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
they live in this new environment,

640
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,960
and interact with a new group of people.

641
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,920
Do you think this person would still choose

642
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,680
to keep in touch with people

643
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,800
who used to be close in their life,

644
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,200
and continue interacting with them?

645
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,480
For example,

646
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
let me use you as an example.

647
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,440
Suppose you're the killer.

648
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,080
Yesterday, your character was always pursuing Ba.

649
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,520
A secret crush.

650
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,200
A secret crush relationship.

651
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,680
Right, so there was still some close contact.

652
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,360
For instance,

653
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,040
before this person came back,

654
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,960
you and Ba

655
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,840
had already been in contact, right?

656
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,280
After coming back,

657
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,960
would you still choose

658
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
to keep interacting with her?

659
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,840
During this process,

660
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,160
isn't there a risk of being exposed?

661
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,680
Wait a second.

662
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,040
You know?

663
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,520
That's the point I'm trying to make.

664
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,240
Right?

665
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
You understand what I mean, right?

666
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,400
Right?

667
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,520
I was just about to mention something.

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
A very solid piece of evidence.

669
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,840
I want to point out that it's him.

670
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
Go ahead, let's hear it.

671
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Tell us, make your case for the most likely suspect.

672
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,880
Let's start with a premise.

673
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,440
Aguai took Jin Pengyou's place.

674
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,040
When he was eighteen.

675
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
He came to this world.

676
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,720
And went to school with us.

677
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,920
Right.

678
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,240
Right.

679
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
So in his previous world,

680
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,840
he was always in that room.

681
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,160
Right.

682
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,080
He doesn't know much about the outside world.

683
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,680
That's correct.

684
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,000
But his room was full of fairy tale books.

685
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,480
Yes.

686
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:29,960
Yes.

687
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,480
For example,

688
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
if I had been locked up for eighteen years,

689
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,440
and I entered society for the first time after eighteen years,

690
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
and all I had read were fairy tales,

691
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,880
what name would I give myself?

692
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,880
Prince Charming.

693
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Highlight.

694
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
Now I actually think

695
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,400
Ke is more suspicious.

696
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,640
Why?

697
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,120
What makes you say that?

698
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,320
He keeps talking about logic, but he doesn't have any.

699
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,640
Who do you think it is?

700
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,160
I think it's him.

701
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,480
Why

702
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,320
He passed by using that disguise as a woman

703
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
Then he brought this person down

704
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,320
Played a role

705
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,680
Then came back here

706
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,920
Then he dressed as a woman

707
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,480
Then he played the Skin-Changer

708
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
Then he played this role again

709
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,840
It's because he returned with a new identity

710
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,960
What kind of ghost was he before

711
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
Skin-Changer ghost

712
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,880
Right, I disguised myself as a woman

713
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,440
So he's very familiar

714
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
with this Skin-Changer lifestyle

715
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,120
In his life path

716
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,440
this keeps happening

717
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
Do you understand what I mean

718
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
Aguai is also

719
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,240
someone who lives with a fake identity

720
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,440
You've always been

721
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,280
Yes

722
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,560
The main logic today

723
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,360
is living by changing identities

724
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,760
Living by changing identities

725
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,160
It means we live in this world

726
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
with someone else's face

727
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,560
So besides my own life

728
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
my real life

729
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,120
I would definitely use this skill

730
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,120
Alright, Skin-Changer ghost, I vote for him

731
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
I also thought it was him at first

732
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,200
No

733
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,080
No, you're just twisting the facts

734
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
Why is it twisting the facts

735
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,920
The way he does things

736
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,720
is taking the blame, changing faces, pretending

737
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes

738
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
The Star of Art was won by pretending

739
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,800
Yes

740
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,600
That's not right.

741
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,840
In 2022, I said

742
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,920
I must become the Star of Deduction.

743
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,240
So that was in 2022.

744
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,120
I hadn't become the Star of Deduction yet.

745
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,720
Which year were you the Star of Deduction?

746
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,360
I was in 2022. I eliminated myself.

747
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
Directly locked onto the culprit.

748
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
I eliminated (someone).

749
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,040
I was the Star of Deduction in 2022.

750
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,440
On what date was the Star of Deduction chosen?

751
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,560
June 3rd.

752
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,080
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

753
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,960
Okay.

754
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,280
What, you locked onto me again?

755
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,240
You found the key clue and eliminated yourself.

756
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
But what about this one?

757
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,840
Wants to fall in love.

758
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,160
This one eliminated him.

759
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,080
Why?

760
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,080
Because I’ve been in a relationship with him for a long time.

761
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,840
He can't pretend he wasn't.

762
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,640
Why would he do that?

763
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
He's my lovesick fool.

764
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm the lovesick fool.

765
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
That's right.

766
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,960
What's wrong? I don't want to fall in love.

767
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm cross-dressing right now.

768
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,520
Okay.

769
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,240
Okay.

770
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Okay.

771
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,040
Today, I choose He as the real culprit.

772
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,200
A golden reputation.

773
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm voting for He.

774
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,080
The real culprit is

775
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,760
the Prince Charming.

776
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Today, my choice for the real culprit is

777
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,560
He.

778
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm casting this vote for

779
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,400
Ke.

780
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,320
This round of the game has failed.

781
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,560
The real culprit is

782
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,800
from Ke's class.

783
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,320
Let me tell you today,

784
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,520
the "dumbest" one is me.

785
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
the "baddest" one is me.

786
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Why?

787
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,840
Because I'm his X.

788
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,960
I vote for Liu Yuning.

789
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,440
Because even after all my efforts to mislead him,

790
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,560
he was still so smart

791
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,080
and firmly chose Ke.

792
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,160
In the end,

793
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,840
I could only go along with him and target Ke too,

794
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,920
just to maintain his trust in me.

795
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,040
This time, as X,

796
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,080
I think I played really well.

797
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,440
Because I directly tied my identity as X

798
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,720
to the previous person who wasn't actually the culprit,

799
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,880
binding us together.

800
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
Everyone believed I was an innocent good guy.

801
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,320
Today's MVP,

802
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,720
I was originally going to give it to myself.

803
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,880
But after turning the tide, right,

804
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,640
and guessing the last culprit,

805
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,680
I think the best player today

806
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,760
was definitely Jin Jing.

807
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,360
Yes, because she

808
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,280
from my perspective,

809
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,480
fooled me ninety-nine percent of the time.

810
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, there was only a brief moment

811
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
when I suspected she might be X,

812
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,920
but the rest of the time,

813
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,240
even though I didn't follow her lead,

814
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
I was still

815
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,800
moving forward by trusting her.

816
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
I think the MVP should be Bai.

817
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,840
It could be him, or it could be He.

818
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,960
Let's vote for both.

819
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,160
It's Bai, and also He.

820
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
First, thanks to Bai

821
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,200
for his strong support and trust.

822
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,800
Also, thanks to He

823
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,280
for stepping up at a crucial moment

824
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,600
and saving face for the men.

825
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,120
Yes.

826
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,040
No doubt, the MVP of this round

827
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,400
is me.

828
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,680
No reason.

829
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,040
I just think I performed really well.

830
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
In which part?

831
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,320
Which part?

832
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,000
I think I did great in all of them.

833
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,280
Especially in

834
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
the part where I played the monster.

835
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,440
I think I was amazing.

836
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
I think I'm the MVP this round.

837
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,600
Because if I don't say it,

838
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,680
I don't think anyone else

839
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,320
would vote for me.

840
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,840
Plus, I didn't pick X this round.

841
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Even though I'm the only one.

842
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,800
So I just feel

843
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,960
no matter what,

844
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,760
I'm the MVP.

845
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,000
Who should we pick as MVP this time?

846
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Pick

847
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,480
Bai.

848
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,640
Pick

849
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,240
Ke.

850
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,080
Forget it.

851
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,480
Pick.

852
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,520
Let's go with Jin Jing, yeah.

853
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Jin Jing really played well this time.

854
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,440
She

855
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,120
Her move was totally unexpected and decisive.

856
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,800
She claimed to be Ba's X.

857
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
None of us saw it coming.

858
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,840
That she would end up being the real culprit's X.

859
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,880
So what she said was really

860
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
something I completely believed in my heart.

861
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,240
Whenever she steered the conversation a bit,

862
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
I felt like her lead

863
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
was what everyone would follow.

864
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,360
I never expected

865
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
she was protecting her little accomplice the whole time.

866
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
But she really played well.

867
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,520
Impressive.

868
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,040
Next time, I won't let you off.
