1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,320
The truth behind Old Master Gu De's disappearance has finally come to light.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,360
It’s you.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,440
The mysterious person watching everyone from the shadows

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,680
has finally slipped up.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
After investigation,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,560
it was found that this person will act during the folk parade.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,160
They infiltrated the parade to investigate.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,600
They also encountered a mysterious woman.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,400
However, when everyone returned to the old mansion,

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,560
they witnessed a man in a black robe

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,960
take his own life in front of everyone.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,280
The villagers insisted

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,440
that he could not have committed suicide.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,280
Another bizarre murder occurred at the Gu De mansion.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,400
How is all of this connected to the mysterious person’s plot

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,720
and what is the link?

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,000
Where exactly is the mysterious person hiding?

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
New suspicions arise.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,080
The truth remains unclear.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,080
After an initial screening,

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,360
the people involved in this case have been identified.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,120
The two of us have always been together.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,760
We’ve always been together.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,360
Alright.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,240
You two investigate this matter thoroughly.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
Why are you acting like this?

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Boss

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,640
Okay

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,720
Boss, you're awesome

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Thank you

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
I just remembered something

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,280
What is it?

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,560
Yeah

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,440
Controlled another person

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,160
If the inhaler's head is hit by an external force

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Right

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
Got it, I understand

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
So after you two fell yesterday

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
With a bang

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Yeah

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,640
Yeah

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,360
It was just you two

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,360
People with vital signs can't go in

44
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,000
So we have to

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
Have fun

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,320
What's their relationship?

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,039
We're father and son.

48
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm his dad.

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,840
I'm his dad.

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm his dad.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
You're turning things upside down.

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,360
Then you guys watch.

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
I'll just go and play it.

54
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Okay.

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,880
You're not going with him?

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
This is my younger son.

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,520
Who asked?

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
He's always liked taking on things since he was little.

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,280
This is...

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
She's the purple mamba.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,680
This is...

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,880
What's that, Herba?

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,920
How do you do it?

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,080
Wait a second.

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Right, you've seen it, haven't you?

66
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
It came out at the end.

67
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
Is it as good as yesterday's?

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
If it involves...

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,600
...restoring this body,

70
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,240
the technology already existed in 1925.

71
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Yes.

72
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,840
To bring him back to life.

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Then why still...

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,280
If what I use is the original person,

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,200
if it's really the person himself,

76
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,600
Right.

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
But yesterday he said...

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
That's right, because he succeeded in replacing.

79
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,600
So actually, we...

80
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
Yes, that's actually what I meant.

81
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
So you all would feel

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,480
that you were unaware

83
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,960
and became...

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,760
Do you get it?

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,040
What's wrong?

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
Bai Yu

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Duck feet, duck wings, chicken feet

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
No money, let's go

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,440
No money, let's go

90
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
No money, let's go

91
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
A man like you

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,240
Your girlfriend goes shopping with you

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,680
And then you

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
No money, let's go

95
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,440
I want to eat this

96
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Don't save us

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,120
Lock him in

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Big bro, lock it in

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
That's too cruel

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,160
Then you guys watch

101
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll just go release it

102
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,760
Three

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,280
Two, one

104
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,160
Open

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Almost, okay, good

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
If that's the case

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Instead, I think his

108
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
suspicion isn't that strong

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,880
Why?

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Let me give a simple example

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,000
Brothers cursing and fighting each other

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
It's all out in the open

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Because I think all his conflicts

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,360
are out in the open

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Me too

116
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,800
No, you two are really hard to find

117
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
No, there's a possibility that

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Why are you joining this parade?

119
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm just bored

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
I came to the human world to have fun

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay

122
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
You also have a little hat

123
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm telling you, it's scarier if you stand inside

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
Cobra

125
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,160
Is that okay?

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
It can be opened.

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
If you turn this, you can open it.

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Do you want to open it?

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,720
There's a box.

130
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
You're really strong.

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
Isn't this just a window?

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,080
Really.

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,240
This.

134
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Let me kick it.

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Move your head away a bit.

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Okay.

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,000
I am.

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,200
Golden Hook Breaking Lotus Root

139
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,920
Is it because there's a photo of me up there?

140
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,480
Yes.

141
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,800
The one under my eye.

142
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,440
That's the one.

143
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,920
So I am.

144
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,240
Isn't that just it?

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,440
That's why I just said

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
I would definitely go look for it right away.

147
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Doesn't that mean you already...

148
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,520
I just looked over it again.

149
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,080
That chat log.

150
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,440
I think the person who most urgently wants to find this

151
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
is

152
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Give me an explanation.

153
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,160
Why did he die here?

154
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,080
We went to attend at 5:40.

155
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,840
Don't say anything.

156
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,160
He came from over there.

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,520
After he slowly walked over,

158
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
He seemed really down.

159
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
That's acceptable too.

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,480
He just edited some of his...

161
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
He just edited some of his...

162
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,080
Never mind.

163
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
Don't laugh, I actually trust you too.

164
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
Why do you trust him?

165
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,440
What about me?

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,320
You don't care.

167
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,200
I don't care either.

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,440
Her carpet is red.

169
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
Even if there's blood, you wouldn't see it.

170
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,840
If you want to pin the crime on me,

171
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,560
there's no need to rush.

172
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,640
This room doesn't have a carpet.

173
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Go and help me lift up all the carpets.

174
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,480
See if there's any crucial evidence.

175
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,920
No.

176
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
I can't stand being falsely accused like this.

177
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm going to check

178
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
the real culprit's room.

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,120
Wait a second.

180
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,280
Weren't we analyzing

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
him making and receiving calls?

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,760
Yes.

183
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Right, we made a mistake.

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
I get it now.

185
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,440
We all started from

186
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes.

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,480
Let's start from the end point.

188
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
If he goes towards

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,880
Yes.

190
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm just saying, if we want to

191
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,760
All three of us have this motive.

192
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,520
But the one who can best connect with that

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
I think it's actually what you said.

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
This sense of justice.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm done talking.

196
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,040
Darling, why is there blood on your face?

197
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
Darling.

198
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
We are husband and wife.

199
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,320
Really?

200
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Don't listen to her nonsense.

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,560
After encountering an obstacle,

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,240
it will activate the video recording function.

203
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,400
So your voice is its obstacle.

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
No, look, it's like this.

205
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,720
We need to go from here to here.

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,240
Okay, got it.

207
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,960
Then let's go.

208
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,840
This thing indicates a point.

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,520
The killer.

210
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
He has it on his cloak.

211
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,040
He must have passed through here.

212
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,800
That's right.

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,640
First point, I just said I...

214
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,720
can only rely on...

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
At this time, I still let...

216
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
Killed—do you think that's reasonable?

217
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Yes, that's right.

218
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
Welcome to the Tui City Welfare Club.

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
We've prepared several benefits.

220
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Waiting for you to claim them.

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bro, did you understand the rules?

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
I understood—failed.

223
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,160
This...

224
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,600
And then?

225
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Isn't this game a bit boring?

226
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
What else do I need to do?

227
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,800
What else needs to be done?

228
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
You won.

229
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,320
That's what it means.

230
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,400
Then I only need two, right?

231
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
None of these three can fall to the ground.

232
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
No way, I don't believe anyone can do it.

233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
Did I sing this?

234
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I sang it.

235
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,240
Where is everyone?

236
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,480
I don't want it anymore.

237
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm not eating anymore.

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,560
Whoever wants to eat can have it.

239
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
Peanuts, sunflower seeds.

240
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
What the heck?

241
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
This won't work.

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
How do you play this? This can't be played.

243
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
Not a single one can succeed, right?

244
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I feel half paralyzed, sorry.

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Are we there?

246
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
Congratulations.

247
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
Challenge completed.

248
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,040
This game isn't for just anyone.

249
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,560
Failed.

250
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,800
It already fell on the ground, right?

251
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,360
Restart the count, it doesn't count as a failure.

252
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,640
Wait a second.

253
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Hold on.

254
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,840
Wait.

255
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
My hand.

256
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
It's too sticky.

257
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,000
Do we prepare just one of these?

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,480
Or does everyone get one?

259
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Just one.

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,960
So just prepare one.

261
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,960
What do you want to eat?

262
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,600
It's not about what I want to eat.

263
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
Then I'll order this specialty rice noodles.

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,480
Shouldn't you get each of us a bowl?

265
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,680
Then three bowls.

266
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,040
Alright.

267
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay, three bowls of "Bai Sanwan."

268
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,840
Alright, okay.

269
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,840
Someone will definitely pick food, right?

270
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Forget it, I'll pick the Old Town dessert.

271
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
Cafeteria, let's go with the cafeteria.

272
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,000
Pick one.

273
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,160
Then let's go with iron spoon rice cake.

274
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Right.

275
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,160
Because I'm worried someone can't eat spicy food.

276
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,120
This one is fine, this one.

277
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,480
Okay.

278
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
What is this prop?

279
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,440
This should be a special skill.

280
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Right?

281
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Forget it, food is still better.

282
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,240
Let's get a big energy nut platter.
