1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,580
Fell asleep.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,100
Who is this?

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,020
Who is it?

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,500
The sun is out.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,180
No wonder I woke up.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,260
Do you know why?

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,820
Why?

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,260
Because I'm a sunshine boy.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,700
Getting some sun is really good.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,620
Sunshine boy.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,020
Isn't that a song?

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,340
Yeah.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,820
I want to eat peanuts, bro.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,420
Buy them.

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,740
Buy whatever she wants to eat. Go get it for her.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,820
May wealth come from all directions.

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,780
No money.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,460
I want this one.

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,300
Actually, both are tasty.

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,940
Then you eat this one.

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,620
But I can tell it's delicious, so...

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,780
That's fine.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,140
Turn around and give a wave with the fan.

24
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,460
Okay.

25
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah, I...

26
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,460
White.

27
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,060
Feed it a little.

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,300
Then it'll be friendlier to you.

29
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,580
Okay.

30
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,740
So detailed.

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,140
Is it that detailed?

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,900
Don't shout, don't shout.

33
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,700
Teachers.

34
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,540
I'm really afraid of shouting.

35
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,180
It's not a Hengdian horse.

36
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,900
If you shout at a Hengdian horse, it starts running.

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,420
Three, two, one, as soon as you start, it runs.

38
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,300
How much do you weigh?

39
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,340
None of your business.

40
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,700
You definitely don't even weigh 140.

41
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,820
Come, let's take a group photo.

42
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,940
A big group photo of the "culprits."

43
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,900
Just sit down, that's fine.

44
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,580
It's okay, whatever works.

45
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:25,820
Come on.

46
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,380
Whatever.

47
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,060
Two against one.

48
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,780
Just do whatever.

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,780
Others want to sit, but you insist on standing.

50
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,860
I don't want to, I want to squat.

51
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,700
You lie down here.

52
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,740
It's fine, no need, just like this.

53
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,020
Come on.

54
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,940
Just stand here, that's fine.

55
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,860
I'll sit.

56
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,540
No need to sit, just stand.

57
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,180
Don't, just pose properly.

58
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,700
Do it properly.

59
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,220
Okay.

60
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,180
This feels like being forced.

61
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm stuck here between these two gangs.

62
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,500
It's like wearing prison clothes.

63
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,580
That's exactly what it looks like.

64
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,740
Come on, hold him like this.

65
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,220
Just like this.

66
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,260
Our gang has arrived.

67
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,220
Your gang has arrived.

68
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Hello, everyone.

69
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,820
Come on, let's take a photo.

70
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,460
Stop messing around over there.

71
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,380
Come on, group photo.

72
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,460
We're on the same team.

73
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Those two bullied me just now.

74
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,740
They held me here.

75
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,540
Serves you right.

76
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,660
Okay.

77
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,500
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

78
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
This is the prop I won.

79
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,060
Today I have to be tied to him.

80
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,220
Why do you get to tie me up just because you won?

81
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,940
I get to pick someone to punish.

82
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,500
But I didn't lose.

83
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,620
Why are you punishing me?

84
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,860
I don't care if you lost or not, I just didn't win.

85
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,900
Ba.

86
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,540
Hello.

87
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,420
Hello.

88
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,140
Ba, you brought a small bag again.

89
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,940
There's food inside.

90
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,540
What's your name?

91
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,020
My name is Bartfulai.

92
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,380
Bartfulai.

93
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
What's wrong?

94
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,460
What do you mean?

95
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,740
So it was you.

96
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,500
Don't talk.

97
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,940
Don't talk.

98
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,140
So it was you.

99
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,820
What's up?

100
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,780
Comrades.

101
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,060
Comrades, her name is

102
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
Bartfulai.

103
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
Bartfulai.

104
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,340
What's up?

105
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,420
Bartfulai.

106
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,620
Bartfulai.

107
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,140
Aren't we going to talk over there in a bit?

108
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,900
Don't worry.

109
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,020
Let's talk over there.

110
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,460
Mysterious woman.

111
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,380
You need to hide for a while.

112
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,500
You need to hide for a while.

113
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
They asked me.

114
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,940
You're so well-behaved.

115
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,020
If they ask you, just answer.

116
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,220
They're a bit crazy today.

117
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,820
Let's go.

118
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,460
We'll catch up later.

119
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,860
Come.

120
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,460
Come.

121
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,660
Come quickly, Di.

122
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,820
Come from the back.

123
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,500
Puppy

124
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,940
She wants to bring

125
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,660
You want to bring

126
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,340
Okay

127
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,740
My fashion accessory

128
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,100
Puppy

129
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,540
Give me an explanation

130
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,340
Why did he die here

131
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,780
Fell asleep

132
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,300
Who is this

133
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
Who is it

134
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,100
It's putting all its weight on my leg now

135
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
It's sitting

136
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,700
Use a bit of strength yourself

137
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,540
Go inside and investigate

138
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:51,980
Go inside

139
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,460
Should we check his body

140
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,180
To see if there's anything

141
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,180
I'll hold the umbrella for you

142
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Something fell

143
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,500
The flower fell

144
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,940
Hairpin

145
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,020
Sorry

146
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,820
Sorry

147
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,820
I gave it a gentle pat

148
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,020
No licking

149
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,300
Good boy.

150
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,260
Just leave it here.

151
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,940
Let it stay with this.

152
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,140
Let it stay with him.

153
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,660
Such a good boy.

154
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,980
Protect him for us.

155
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,380
Don't bring him back to life.

156
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,340
It's so well-behaved, it's sleeping.

157
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,660
Take the dog and the snacks away.

158
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,220
As soon as she touches these two things,

159
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,660
So good.

160
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,100
Your paw is still on me.

161
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,340
Your paw is still on my hand.

162
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,140
Puppy.

163
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,420
It's very good, it kept sighing just now.

164
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,860
Let's go.

165
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,500
Can't we take the puppy with us?

166
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,380
It'll stay here.

167
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,700
After you finish work tonight,

168
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,020
you can rent it back to the hotel.

169
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,260
Rent it back to the hotel.

170
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Rent it for one night.

171
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,020
Rent it for one night.

172
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,980
Let's go, puppy.

173
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,700
Go.

174
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,660
It's obedient.

175
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,300
Come here.

176
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,100
Puppy.

177
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,500
Come here.

178
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,020
Let's go.

179
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,380
How about it?

180
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,060
Wait, it says you can buy tokens.

181
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,740
One token per play.

182
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,940
Look, that's fifty yuan.

183
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,100
Fifty plays, that's too many.

184
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,220
Then you could play a hundred times.

185
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,540
Fifty yuan for a hundred tokens.

186
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,740
Just buy twenty tokens.

187
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Let's get twenty.

188
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,980
Buy twenty, that's twenty yuan.

189
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,380
Right, just buy twenty yuan worth.

190
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,780
Here's the money.

191
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,580
Come on, you two.

192
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,220
Come on.

193
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,020
But I can't catch the dolls.

194
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,540
Give it a try.

195
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,260
You try to grab one.

196
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,540
Just play.

197
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,220
I can do it.

198
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,140
You can do it, can you help me catch one?

199
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,540
I'm a bit better at it.

200
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,820
Then each person gets two.

201
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,580
Each person gets two or three.

202
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,100
I'm a bit better at it.

203
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,340
You go.

204
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,500
Then you...

205
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,140
Yeah, you go.

206
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,940
I'll hold it first.

207
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,940
Look, the claw is too soft.

208
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,500
It's based on probability.

209
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,700
Maybe once every ten tries, it'll grip tightly.

210
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,500
Okay.

211
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,300
Go ahead.

212
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,900
So close.

213
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,980
Nice, very accurate.

214
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,820
It's okay.

215
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,620
There's more, try again.

216
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,180
It's accurate, but this one won't work.

217
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,580
Last three tries.

218
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,980
Almost.

219
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,820
It's almost done.

220
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Push Sweet Candy Factory.

221
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,420
This is the arcade.

222
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,340
Don't overthink it.

223
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,460
Do you believe I can get it in one try?

224
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,500
I can catch a doll.

225
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,340
I don't believe it.

226
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,300
I really don't believe it.

227
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,700
Why not grab this one?

228
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,660
You try.

229
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,820
That's one way.

230
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
I've seen this before.

231
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,340
Can't get in.

232
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,540
Really?

233
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,820
Almost.

234
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
So close.

235
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,180
Come on, keep going.

236
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,860
Try again.

237
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,700
I think this one will work.

238
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,300
This one, let's go.

239
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,060
He's going to help me catch it.

240
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,940
Get it!

241
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,820
Could this really work this time?

242
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,340
It's really possible.

243
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,300
Give it another try.

244
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,540
Let's meow together.

245
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,620
Acting cute in front of you.

246
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,860
Oh, meow meow meow meow meow.

247
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,300
What is this for?

248
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,300
This seems to be for catching small ones.

249
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
This one works too.

250
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
We can try this one.

251
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,780
Catching this one is a bit...

252
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,580
I don't want to catch this one.

253
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,460
You should catch that kind.

254
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,660
The ones lying sideways.

255
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,740
This won't work, not the left, not the right.

256
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,100
This is even worse, this won't do.

257
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,700
Let's go.

258
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,420
Alright, let's go.

259
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,100
We got nothing.

260
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,540
We wasted twenty yuan.

261
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,780
Are we out of tokens?

262
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,300
It's okay.

263
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,540
Are we out of tokens?

264
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,700
Then we have to wait for him to come save us.

265
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,660
Yeah, the card can't be in the cell, right?

266
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,260
Then let's sit for a while.

267
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,980
Go ahead and sit down.

268
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,740
Take a break.

269
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,980
No.

270
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,860
There's something.

271
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,100
There's something there.

272
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,860
We should be able to reach something.

273
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,059
Try picking it up with chopsticks.

274
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,660
That should work.

275
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,860
I don't have any here.

276
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,140
Check if there's anything in that pile of grass.

277
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,700
I don't have any here.

278
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,060
Nothing.

279
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,700
You should be able to reach the ones on your side.

280
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,420
Those two.

281
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,020
I have to throw it to you.

282
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,020
I don't want it.

283
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,340
What do you think it means that we're locked in here together?

284
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,420
It means we are...

285
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,660
One of us must be the culprit.

286
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,940
You're right.

287
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
I knew it all along.

288
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,260
One of us has a problem.

289
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,100
Like that.

290
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,260
What are you doing?

291
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,740
I'm giving it to you.

292
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,540
I'm throwing it over.

293
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
I can't pick it up with the tongs.

294
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,380
Just put it on the ground.

295
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,860
The light flashed.

296
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,980
Look, it's time to test my aim.

297
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,820
Can you reach it?

298
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes.

299
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,260
What are you doing?

300
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,340
Why aren't you behaving?

301
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,580
You dropped everything on the floor.

302
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,540
Bro.

303
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,020
We're on the same side.

304
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,660
Behave yourself.

305
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,780
Okay.

306
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,620
Restrain him.

307
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,580
Restrain him.

308
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm behaving now.

309
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,780
Let's try first and see if we can—

310
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,460
—find a way to keep it from falling on the ground.

311
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Just lift the box directly.

312
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Not really working.

313
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,980
It's heavy.

314
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,260
It's really hard to push this box.

315
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,380
I can move it, but...

316
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,060
But it's a bit difficult.

317
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,860
Look.

318
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,980
No, it's too heavy.

319
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,220
If it's a bit hard...

320
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,380
Is this a piece of cloth or a bag?

321
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,300
This should be a piece of cloth.

322
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,180
You just...

323
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,100
Let me see.

324
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,260
Yeah, cover it and drag it over.

325
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,500
You mean I take the cloth...

326
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,340
Cover it with the cloth, right?

327
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,260
Yes, cover it with the cloth.

328
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,700
Then, together with the cloth...

329
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,180
Bring it over together with this green thing.

330
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,780
Right.

331
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,620
Oh no.

332
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,700
It's fine.

333
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,180
It's right next to you.

334
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,020
Oh no, mine...

335
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,460
This thing is actually pretty useful.

336
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't rush.

337
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,060
I can push it in a bit more for you.

338
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,980
Is that okay?

339
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:23,980
It's fine.

340
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,500
What are you doing?

341
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,260
Why are you moving around again?

342
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,380
Why is it always you who moves?

343
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,900
I didn't move. I can't even move my hands.

344
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
I can't move anymore.

345
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,940
Restrain him.

346
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,460
No need.

347
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,660
Stick it out.

348
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,940
Hand over the item.

349
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,260
What item?

350
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,860
What item?

351
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,860
I don't have anything.

352
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,780
Look.

353
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,460
There's nothing.

354
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,500
What's this?

355
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,020
What is it?

356
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,460
Give it to me.

357
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,980
I don't have it.

358
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,220
Hand it over.

359
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,300
I don't have anything. That's my hand.

360
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,380
I'll restrain you again.

361
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,940
I...

362
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,740
Give it to me.

363
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,260
I'll give it to you.

364
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,740
Can you take this off too?

365
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,340
Hurry up.

366
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,980
Can everyone behave, please?

367
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,700
Okay.

368
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,660
Behaving.

369
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,260
Behaving.

370
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,100
Okay.

371
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,860
Got it.

372
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,540
Don't drop things on the floor.

373
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,620
Use two chopsticks to pick it up.

374
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,260
Use your two chopsticks to bring it over.

375
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,700
Right.

376
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,780
Okay, take your hand out.

377
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,220
Let me try first.

378
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,260
Say it again.

379
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,580
Don't put things on the floor.

380
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,540
On the floor, right.

381
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,060
I'll set this up first.

382
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,100
I still need to follow your lead.

383
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,180
That's right.

384
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,540
Don't rush, let me adjust the position first.

385
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,700
I need to make it easier for you to grab too.

386
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,420
I can't be the only one picking it up.

387
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,140
The length is enough.

388
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,740
The length is fine.

389
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Like this, I'll bring it over to you.

390
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,980
Can you grab it from above and below?

391
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,060
Sure, I have no problem.

392
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,620
But you need to hold it steady.

393
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,420
It's a bit hard.

394
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,140
You...

395
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,660
It's a bit difficult.

396
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,780
Like this.

397
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,860
But how are you grabbing it?

398
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,420
Hold it steady.

399
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,860
Don't let go yet.

400
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,820
Don't knock it off.

401
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,460
You guys are being too dishonest.

402
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,660
Give him another measure.

403
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,260
Yes.

404
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,340
What's going on with you guys?

405
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,140
I already said it.

406
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,900
Don't drop my things on the floor.

407
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,820
Okay, big brother.

408
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,580
I just fell asleep, what's going on?

409
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,900
It fell by itself.

410
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,060
Say hello to sister-in-law.

411
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,660
Behave yourself.

412
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,260
Okay.

413
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,540
Hello, big brother, hello, sister-in-law.

414
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,980
Big brother, you look really cool.

415
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,540
Big brother.

416
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,100
I think we're about to succeed.

417
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,340
We still have to clamp it.

418
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,420
I can't put it on top.

419
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,940
Because putting it on top is too unstable.

420
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,660
What are you arguing about?

421
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,620
Time to eat.

422
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,700
Time to eat.

423
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,340
They're eating.

424
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,260
What is going on with you all?

425
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,500
I told you, you can't drop things on the ground.

426
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,860
It's too hard.

427
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,100
How did the mask fall off?

428
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
It didn't fall, I put it on.

429
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,220
I put it on.

430
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,500
It's too hard.

431
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,340
Bro, aren't you going to eat?

432
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,500
Bro, go eat.

433
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
It's too hard.

434
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,220
You'll get too skinny if you don't eat.

435
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,860
Bro.

436
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,460
Sister-in-law is calling you home for dinner.

437
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,900
Dinner's not ready yet.

438
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,100
Okay.

439
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Everyone, behave yourselves.

440
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,820
Keep watch.

441
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,980
Yes.

442
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,940
The sun is out.

443
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,740
No wonder I woke up.

444
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,820
The sun is out, really.

445
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,860
Do you know why?

446
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,340
Why?

447
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,620
Because I'm a sunny boy.

448
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,580
It feels so nice to sit in the sun for a while.

449
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,060
It's really good to get some sun.

450
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
Sunbathing is great.

451
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,820
Yeah, I like sunbathing too.

452
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,900
It's really nice.

453
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,180
After sunbathing, I feel like

454
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,580
I've become awesome.

455
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeah.

456
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,180
I've turned into a sunny boy.

457
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,140
Right.

458
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,460
Sunny boy.

459
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,660
Isn't that a song?

460
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,500
Yeah.

461
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Mushrooms.

462
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,780
Mushrooms.

463
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,220
Little mushrooms.

464
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,380
Will eating these make you sick?

465
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,180
Yes.

466
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,940
Probably.

467
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,420
If you eat them, you'll turn into Ba.

468
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,780
Hurry up and get it for me.

469
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,860
Are we going back to prison now?

470
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,380
No.

471
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,500
Go back.

472
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,980
Go back to that big mansion.

473
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,420
You go back to prison.

474
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,380
I want to eat this.

475
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
I want to eat peanuts.

476
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,740
No money.

477
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,340
I want to eat peanuts, bro.

478
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,140
Buy it.

479
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,420
Buy whatever you want to eat.

480
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,180
Let's buy it for her.

481
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,940
Do we still have money?

482
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,700
Buy it.

483
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,260
No money.

484
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
May wealth come from all directions.

485
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,980
No money.

486
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,540
I just want this, that's enough.

487
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,620
I want this.

488
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,900
I gave you bread but you wouldn't eat it.

489
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,020
You like eating this kind of stuff.

490
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,260
This one is the fattiest.

491
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,100
What's it got to do with you?

492
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,420
Hit him.

493
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,740
I've already been beaten up by her like this.

494
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,740
Green Tea Appraisal Bureau.

495
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,020
It's about becoming sworn brothers with someone.

496
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,380
Then the playboy turns himself in.

497
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Calling each other brothers.

498
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,500
Secretly flirting.

499
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,220
I only feel sorry for my brother.

500
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,180
Puppy

501
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,380
Puppy

502
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,460
Don't tease it.

503
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,380
Why shouldn't we tease it?

504
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,780
It's probably not a stray, right?

505
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,660
It's a big dog, you don't even know its temperament.

506
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,580
There are snakes here.

507
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,340
I have a big dog at home.

508
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,180
I have a dog too.

509
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,219
It's that one.

510
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:18,900
Schnauzer

511
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,060
Yeah.

512
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,780
Schnauzer

513
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,940
The one that looks like it has a little mustache.

514
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,499
Yeah.

515
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:26,060
Didn't you film before?

516
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,739
When you were filming "An Le Zhuan,"

517
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:28,540
Didn't you bring it with you?

518
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Yeah.

519
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,660
It seemed pretty young back then.

520
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:30,940
Still young.

521
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,460
It's grown up now, right?

522
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,180
It's pretty big now.

523
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,900
You only have that one dog, right?

524
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,180
Yeah, just that one.

525
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,260
It's still at home now.

526
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,860
Yeah.

527
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,580
When I go out, I leave it with my...

528
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,860
I leave it at my manager's parents' house.

529
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,100
Boarding.

530
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,340
Why is he walking so fast?

531
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,620
Murderer.

532
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,220
Hold this for me.

533
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,580
You bought that food yourself.

534
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,420
And you still want me to hold it for you?

535
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
I can't carry it.

536
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,420
Yeah.

537
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,580
Why do you look like such a fool?

538
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,140
What a bad man.

539
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,900
I just went to learn it.

540
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,620
What?

541
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,740
That thing Manba does.

542
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,580
What does Baby learn every day?

543
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,740
She learns all sorts of weird things every day.

544
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,260
There's no meme she doesn't know.

545
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,060
Let me tell you.

546
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,420
Alright, let's start.

547
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,020
Start.

548
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,660
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

549
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,700
Let's begin.

550
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,580
I brought you some snacks.

551
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,900
Yeah, we can have a little snack first.

552
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,980
Thank you.

553
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,700
Do you want to eat?

554
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,980
Sweet fried dough twist.

555
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,620
This one is tasty.

556
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,900
Actually, both are delicious.

557
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,700
I want to eat this one.

558
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,580
Then you have this one.

559
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,020
Tasty, right?

560
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,460
It's really good.

561
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,860
I want some too.

562
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,860
Did you buy this?

563
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,300
We bought it here.

564
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,580
No, we brought it over.

565
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,260
We brought it.

566
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,580
You're not dieting, right?

567
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,420
It's super sweet.

568
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,260
Not dieting.

569
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,740
But I can tell it's delicious, so...

570
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,140
Sure.

571
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,940
Today, compared to yesterday, I really

572
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,980
feel much sleepier than yesterday.

573
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,820
Today, I went back in the middle

574
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
and fell asleep on the sofa.

575
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,300
What did you do last night?

576
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,180
Nothing.

577
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
And I didn't go to bed late either.

578
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,140
Did you get enough rest?

579
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,660
Yes, I did.

580
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,180
So you're well-rested today.

581
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,420
Yeah.

582
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,380
Yesterday, I wasn't well-rested.

583
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,700
Yesterday, it was like I was on stimulants.

584
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Yesterday, I wasn't well-rested.

585
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,780
Really? You seemed in great shape yesterday.

586
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,020
Yesterday, I wasn't well-rested.

587
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,220
I hope you never sleep well.

588
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,780
If I don't sleep well, then I...

589
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,460
Alright.

590
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,500
Show your best form.

591
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,580
My best form?

592
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,700
I don't need to use my best form.

593
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,940
Because I've already got you locked down.

594
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,260
If I show my best form again,

595
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,940
what would you do then?

596
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,740
Got it.

597
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
I advise you not to play like this.

598
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,260
Whatever you say today

599
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,780
won't work on me anymore.

600
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,860
Then I won't say anything.

601
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,100
Okay.

602
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,700
Thanks.

603
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,580
Do you want to take something to eat?

604
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,380
I have one, it's in my hand.

605
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,580
Take this one.

606
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,900
It's fine, this is enough for me.

607
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
Ba, didn't you already eat?

608
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,380
Who?

609
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,900
You.

610
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,500
Didn't we eat in prison?

611
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,220
But that doesn't stop me from eating bread.

612
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,500
Mainly, after we got out of prison,

613
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
and entered that room,

614
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,860
she ate another pack of something.

615
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,620
She really likes to eat.

616
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,860
I really want to eat my bread.

617
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,820
Aren't you eating?

618
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,380
I'm not eating.

619
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,300
I really can't eat anymore.

620
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,140
It's delicious.

621
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,620
Do you want to try this?

622
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,700
What is this?

623
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,540
Just break off a piece.

624
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,660
Really not eating.

625
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,140
Not eating.

626
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,220
You have great self-control.

627
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,140
I just ate that biscuit, the crispy one.

628
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,860
And sweet potato.

629
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,580
Tasty, right?

630
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Where did you get all this bread?

631
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,900
Where did you buy it?

632
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,460
Shenzhen.

633
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,020
Quick, look at the old lady's room.

634
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,100
It's so creepy.

635
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,020
Sis, you go in by yourself.

636
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,340
No, the old lady's room—

637
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,980
There are photos of Zhang Linghe everywhere.

638
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:55,900
Yeah.

639
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,100
Because this was yesterday—

640
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,420
Yue and his room.

641
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,380
Look closely at this photo of Zhang Linghe.

642
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,580
Look.

643
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,500
Did you see it?

644
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,620
He blinked.

645
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,140
If the moon hasn't come yet,

646
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,700
the streetlight can still shine on the windowsill.

647
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,020
This was at one of his New Year's Eve parties.

648
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,980
Do you want to be the boss?

649
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,140
I don't want to.

650
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,300
Why would I want to be the boss?

651
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,100
He wants to be the boss.

652
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,580
For many years.

653
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,700
Because the She pattern has started to appear.

654
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,660
Yeah.

655
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,820
Who gave him this stick again?

656
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,380
Who was it? I told you before.

657
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,580
He's holding my stick, right?

658
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,300
You already took the one from yesterday home.

659
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,420
This is mine. I didn't take it home.

660
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,900
Let's go.

661
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,420
Pull.

662
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,300
Pull.

663
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,580
Okay.

664
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,620
We're leaving.

665
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,220
Let's go, Jiawei.

666
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,180
Let's go, we're heading out.

667
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,020
How strong is the taste of black coffee?

668
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,460
How strong is the taste of black coffee?

669
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,100
I only want soda.

670
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,460
Is this straightened?

671
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,540
Pull.

672
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,460
No, let me fix it in place first.

673
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,380
Let's keep going.

674
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,660
No, I'm about to turn a corner here.

675
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,500
No, your corner doesn't count.

676
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,380
You have to look at this one.

677
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,820
There's another corner here, right?

678
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,380
Yeah.

679
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,860
I'm really tired.

680
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,980
So tired, really so tired.

681
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,540
It's tough.

682
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:42,900
It's okay.

683
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,500
No, you have to take care of five kids.

684
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah, I have to manage a lot of things.

685
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,060
So,

686
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,820
I'm exhausted.

687
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,140
I'm a bit tired, guys.

688
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,900
Even someone like me, who doesn't handle anything, is tired.

689
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,980
Next, Ning is going to speak.

690
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,620
Everyone, listen to his instructions.

691
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,220
Especially...

692
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,780
No, just kidding.

693
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,180
Because I'm really grateful to you all.

694
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,900
You've always supported me.

695
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,460
Some of the childish things I suggested,

696
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
you were all willing to join me.

697
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,540
You never killed my vibe.

698
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,220
Being on this show has made me really happy.

699
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
It's painful but joyful at the same time.

700
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
For example, look,

701
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,460
when I say something to someone,

702
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,420
they listen right away.

703
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,220
Put the stick down.

704
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,300
Really.

705
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,380
Let's go.

706
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,820
Come on.

707
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,700
Three, two, one.

708
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,820
Go, look at the camera.

709
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,580
Where are you going?

710
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,700
What kind of walk is that?

711
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:33,820
What kind of walk is that?

712
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,460
Just walk in place.

713
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,220
Just pretend to walk, that's enough.

714
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,820
You're really going?

715
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,140
Just one step is enough.

716
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Pretend to walk, okay.

717
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,620
Come on.

718
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,900
Haven't you seen that fake walking photo trend on Douyin?

719
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
What are you doing? What's this?

720
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,220
Pretending to leave.

721
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,140
Pretending to leave for a photo.

722
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,260
Three

723
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,860
Two

724
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,180
One

725
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,580
Go

726
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,420
Right, just one movement is enough.

727
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,180
One, two, three, then go.

728
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,340
Okay

729
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,140
No

730
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,620
I'm telling you, if you do it like this—

731
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,980
You're not solid.

732
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,260
What are you doing?

733
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,420
It's fine to film one person.

734
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,860
Why are you making that jingling noise up front?

735
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,940
Jingling

736
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,380
That's your phone.

737
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
You can look for the good-looking one.

738
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,620
He can't do it, it's all too weak.

739
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,940
Should we add some variation?

740
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,420
Is that okay?

741
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,860
Variation

742
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,220
A bit of that arms-around-shoulders look.

743
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,740
And someone squatting, like that.

744
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,660
Night Parade of One Hundred Demons

745
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,540
Yes, Night Parade of One Hundred Demons.

746
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,740
Like the vibe from "Bu Liang Ren."

747
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,620
Bu Liang Ren

748
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,220
Bu Liang Ren

749
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
My husband made that animation.

750
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,260
"Painting Rivers and Lakes: Bu Liang Ren"

751
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,300
I've seen it.

752
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,500
Black and White Impermanence

753
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,260
Zhou Keyu, a little higher.

754
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,020
Don't lean down too much.

755
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,780
Yes, good.

756
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,580
Okay, then I'll squat.

757
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,220
Then I'll squat down.

758
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,780
Yes, good.

759
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,940
Come on, look over here.

760
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,820
Three, two, one.

761
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,500
Okay, that's fine.

762
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,220
Thank you all for your hard work.

763
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,980
Thank you.

764
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,540
There's one more short video, please wait a moment.

765
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,020
Keep the same positions as before.

766
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,420
Just like before.

767
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,860
Alright.

768
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:54,900
Finally, it's higher.

769
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
I'll come up in a bit too.

770
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,340
Go down.

771
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,900
Let's take a group shot first.

772
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Everyone, just keep it simple.

773
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,820
With the props in your hands.

774
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,940
Just interact with them a little.

775
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,500
Is this vertical or horizontal?

776
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,860
Horizontal.

777
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,620
Very happy.

778
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,260
Everyone, just interact simply with your props.

779
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,660
Okay.

780
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,420
Strike a cooler pose.

781
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,900
Then let's act like ghosts.

782
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,740
How do you act like a ghost, sis?

783
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,180
Like this.

784
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,620
Alright.

785
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,060
That works.

786
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,540
Right?

787
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,660
Yes.

788
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,020
How do we do it?

789
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,580
Just like that.

790
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm going to blow on it.

791
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,260
Maybe after I blow, someone will die.

792
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,580
Something like that.

793
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,860
That's so creepy.

794
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,740
Ghost Blows Out the Light.

795
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,140
You look so cool doing that.

796
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,380
Ghost Blows Out the Light.

797
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,980
Ghost Blows Out the Light.

798
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,260
Who said "Ghost Blows Out the Light"?

799
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,980
It's flashing, the battery's dead.

800
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,700
It turned off.

801
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,260
The ghost blew it out.

802
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,020
No, it's electric.

803
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,380
Yeah.

804
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,300
Teachers, could you please crouch down a bit over here?

805
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,380
That's so scary.

806
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,300
There's a light control trick.

807
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,060
I got it.

808
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,740
I'll come out from behind you.

809
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,980
Right.

810
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,180
You saw that one, right?

811
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,740
What?

812
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,940
There's a video like that.

813
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,980
Like this, coming out like this.

814
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,820
Then it looks like one person with two heads.

815
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,620
Do you know that feeling?

816
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,020
Like one grows out from behind her.

817
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,420
I did something like that in a role.

818
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,580
It came out like this from the male lead.

819
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,500
Yeah, that's it.

820
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,260
Because it's a ghost.

821
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,100
We need this, it's really cool.

822
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,420
Gives me goosebumps.

823
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,780
At first, it feels like something's on your back.

824
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,940
Then it suddenly comes out.

825
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,500
That's pretty awesome.

826
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,020
This works.

827
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,060
Is it blocking your eyes?

828
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,540
No.

829
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,100
It's blocking my mouth.

830
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,380
Come on, teachers.

831
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,180
Teachers.

832
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,580
Three, two, one.

833
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,180
Why is there no sound?

834
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,580
Why is there still someone here?

835
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,180
Isn't this a video?

836
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
It's so quiet.

837
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,220
No, she laughed out loud.

838
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,420
I thought it was like a ghostly laugh.

839
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,220
What do you mean?

840
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,980
I'm the one laughing, and you call it a ghost laugh?

841
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,620
No.

842
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,140
I think we can make our movements bigger.

843
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
This movement is good.

844
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, everyone move a bit.

845
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,780
Then you take a step forward.

846
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,340
Turn around.

847
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,820
Then I'll take a step.

848
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,420
Then I'll get up from below.

849
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,300
Okay.

850
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Someone spins around.

851
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,260
Your fan.

852
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,980
Stop squatting all the time.

853
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,300
Hit.

854
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,940
You were squatting just now too.

855
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,700
Turn around.

856
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,940
Maybe you can add something.

857
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,380
Like making it fly or something.

858
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,940
Make the movement bigger.

859
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,300
Yeah, turn around and swing the fan.

860
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,620
Okay.

861
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:03,980
Right.

862
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,860
I do it like this.

863
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,100
Don't block her.

864
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,820
Just do your own thing.

865
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,220
Turn around for them, go.

866
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,300
What can my bird do?

867
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,900
Let your bird fly a bit.

868
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,700
You fly.

869
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,140
Use the wire rig.

870
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,980
Which shot?

871
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,940
Three, two, one.

872
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,660
Okay.

873
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,860
Shall we take a look?

874
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Take a look.

875
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,020
Show us.

876
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,780
Let's watch the playback.

877
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,220
Watch the playback.

878
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,780
I laughed out loud again.

879
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,740
Looks great.

880
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,420
Looks great.

881
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,620
That's fine.

882
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,300
That's fine.

883
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,980
Next, we have two more shots.

884
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,220
Then the group in red.

885
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,380
Then the group in white.

886
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,860
Fight.

887
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,300
Showdown.

888
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,900
Dance.

889
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,420
Showdown.

890
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,900
Red team goes first.

891
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,980
Okay, red team goes first.

892
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,420
You look beautiful too.

893
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,700
Then...

894
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
The three teachers can...

895
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,060
Interact with the props in your hands.

896
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,900
And this side's movements...

897
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,460
Can be a bit bigger.

898
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,780
Diabolo.

899
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,460
Mage.

900
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,740
After I count down three, two, one...

901
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,860
Teacher Reba, reach out and swing the camera this way.

902
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,620
It really is the one who dances.

903
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,900
Jump, jump, jump, turn around.

904
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,460
Right.

905
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,820
Right.

906
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,140
Yours is so tiny.

907
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,940
On you.

908
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,380
Come on, get ready.

909
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,820
Three, two, one.

910
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,580
Teachers, interact.

911
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,140
Interact.

912
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Move with the prop. Okay.

913
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,940
Ready, three, two, one.

914
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,260
Ready.

915
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,420
Three, two, one, go.

916
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
Perfect.

917
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,340
Perfect.

918
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,940
Okay.

919
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,500
It's the white team's turn.

920
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,060
Okay, start interacting.

921
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,740
Three, two, one, go.

922
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,260
Perfect.

923
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,420
Alright.

924
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,860
Okay.

925
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,540
Okay, let's officially begin.

926
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,580
Three, two, one, start.

927
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:41,740
Three, two, one, start.

928
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,460
I didn't even make a sound.

929
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,860
That was really loud.

930
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,180
Where do we go in?

931
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,580
Go up on stage.

932
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,300
Yes.

933
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,020
Which way in?

934
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,380
Come.

935
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,780
Be careful.

936
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,220
You two help each other.

937
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,500
No need to go up.

938
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,220
Come back.

939
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,580
Sorry.

940
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,380
This isn't our home field.

941
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:09,900
Then mine.

942
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,780
Where are the dots?

943
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,300
That's not right.

944
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Is it this one?

945
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,540
There are six here.

946
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,380
This one has a number.

947
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,260
Go further.

948
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,540
There's a number.

949
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,460
Why are you tagging along with our red team?

950
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,260
We're splitting into teams for this?

951
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,260
Alright then.

952
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,580
What's this? Why?

953
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,140
Why?

954
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,020
Feeding the horse? Yes.

955
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,900
Carrots from Ning.

956
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,180
White.

957
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,020
White.

958
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,180
You feed it.

959
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,260
It'll be friendlier to you.

960
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,420
That's so detailed.

961
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,180
Is it really that detailed?

962
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,820
Didn't expect that.

963
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,140
We can ride horses after the group?

964
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,780
Which horse is mine?

965
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,380
This one.

966
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,940
Ning.

967
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,460
Which one do you want?

968
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm fine with any.

969
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,500
The light one or the brown one?

970
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,300
I'll take the brown one. The brown one.

971
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Then I'll take the light one.

972
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,740
Are we riding side by side? Right?

973
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,820
One in front, one behind.

974
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,460
Feed it a carrot.

975
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,220
Come.

976
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,020
Good horse.

977
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,940
It can't chew anymore.

978
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,260
Alright, that's enough.

979
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,220
Is this horse well-behaved?

980
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,740
This horse is pretty well-behaved.

981
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,340
Very well-behaved.

982
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,820
Okay.

983
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,060
It's scared.

984
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,460
A little nervous.

985
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,860
It's okay.

986
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,260
I don't bite.

987
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,500
Alright.

988
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,780
It's hard for it to eat with this mouth, right?

989
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,060
You give it. Go ahead.

990
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,620
You can just give it.

991
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,580
Alright.

992
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,060
Alright.

993
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,460
We'll go one in front, one behind.

994
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:38,700
Right.

995
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,100
Will this horse rear up?

996
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,780
It won't.

997
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,020
It seems pretty obedient, not bad.

998
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,780
This one might be a bit timid.

999
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,540
This one is a bit timid.

1000
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,700
Alright, it's fine.

1001
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,540
This horse feels really skinny.

1002
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,860
It started shaking as soon as I got on.

1003
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Did you ever consider

1004
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,020
that maybe you've gained weight recently?

1005
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,460
Come on, I don't even weigh 140 jin.

1006
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,180
Right.

1007
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,140
No.

1008
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,100
How much do you weigh?

1009
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,980
None of your business.

1010
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,340
You definitely don't weigh 140 jin either.

1011
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,140
I weigh 150 jin.

1012
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,260
Seventy-five kilos? No way.

1013
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,980
Alright, everyone, let's get started.

1014
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,300
Come on.

1015
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,940
Come on, hurry, give it to me.

1016
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,900
Don't shout, everyone.

1017
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,580
I'm really afraid of shouting.

1018
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,700
This isn't a Hengdian horse.

1019
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,580
The Hengdian horses start running as soon as you shout.

1020
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,020
As soon as you say "three, two, one, go," they run.

1021
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,420
As soon as someone says "action," it knows.

1022
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,820
You even have to ignite it.

1023
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,980
Oh no, I'm not light.

1024
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,660
It's fine.

1025
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,059
Let its rear drop a bit.

1026
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:24,619
Its rear is crooked.

1027
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:54,980
Horse.

1028
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,900
Three, two, one.

1029
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,340
Go.

1030
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,460
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

1031
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,060
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

1032
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,100
Let's do it again.

1033
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,100
I'll get off first.

1034
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,020
It's too heavy.

1035
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,460
Where do I go from?

1036
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,940
It really is a white horse.

1037
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,220
Are you coming down?

1038
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,500
You can come down first and let them carry it back.

1039
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
You all look so cool riding horses.

1040
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,180
Then let's switch.

1041
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,780
They all have white horses.

1042
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,060
You look great on horseback.

1043
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
What color is this horse?

1044
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,860
Thank you, everyone, for your hard work.

1045
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,500
Thanks for your hard work.

1046
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,140
Thank you, little horse.

1047
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,340
Be careful.

1048
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,100
Watch out for the horse's rear.

1049
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,340
Why do you still have a fan?

1050
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,580
You're not taking the role anymore?

1051
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
You didn't have a fan when you went over there just now.

1052
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,700
I just put it here.

1053
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,500
No.

1054
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,100
No.

1055
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,140
Okay.

1056
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,700
No, I just had it.

1057
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,660
I want to ride a horse too.

1058
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,100
I've never ridden one.

1059
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,580
You've never ridden a horse?

1060
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,540
I rode the kind in the park once.

1061
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,740
But you've never ridden this kind of horse.

1062
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,780
No, I've never ridden one while filming.

1063
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,260
They look so cool riding horses.

1064
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,020
Have you ridden before?

1065
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,660
Yes, I have.

1066
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,060
Everyone, this fire here—

1067
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,580
needs a few minutes to cool down.

1068
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,700
So let's go back and wait a few minutes.

1069
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,100
They look so cool riding horses.

1070
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,140
Are you scared?

1071
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,820
I'm not afraid of horses.

1072
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,540
But they look so good riding them.

1073
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,380
She can get on and try riding now.

1074
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,460
No, I think you look the coolest riding this horse.

1075
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,100
You look the coolest on this one.

1076
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,940
Really? Why?

1077
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,420
You suit horseback riding so well.

1078
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,300
Do you want to ride?

1079
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,340
Now, you mean?

1080
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,740
Yes, they have someone in charge.

1081
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,860
Haven't you never ridden before?

1082
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,620
I'm not brave enough.

1083
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,580
Give it a carrot.

1084
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,140
Give it a carrot.

1085
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,860
Whenever there's fire, this horse gets really scared.

1086
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,780
It's okay, I've got it.

1087
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,260
That white horse is a bit restless too, a little bit.

1088
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,340
That little white one in front.

1089
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,740
It'll take about ten minutes.

1090
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,260
Then we'll wait a bit.

1091
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,020
This time we'll shoot close-ups.

1092
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,500
It's a bit tricky when turning in circles, right?

1093
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,420
Because when we turn, all four of us have to turn in circles.

1094
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,420
We can take pictures here.

1095
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,660
Let's sit at different heights.

1096
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,500
You sit a bit higher.

1097
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,700
Who's going to take the photo for us?

1098
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,660
Um...

1099
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,940
Come on.

1100
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,300
Coming.

1101
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,940
Right, we need to take a photo.

1102
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,220
Let's take a group shot.

1103
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,060
Not this close.

1104
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,380
From the back, see how nice it looks.

1105
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,980
Edit it later to make me look just like her.

1106
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,220
Okay.

1107
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Does it look good?

1108
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,500
It definitely looks good.

1109
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm not worried about you or me.

1110
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Let's take a close-up.

1111
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,100
One, two...

1112
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,740
Okay.

1113
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,100
So beautiful.

1114
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,380
Thank you.

1115
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,260
Let those four ride horses behind us.

1116
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,420
The two of us will stand in front.

1117
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,660
Hurry.

1118
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,740
Alright, come on.

1119
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,060
Can we take a photo?

1120
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,420
Come on.

1121
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,500
The horses can be ridden behind the two of us.

1122
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,660
I'll kick you again if you do that.

1123
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,540
Take a big group photo.

1124
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,340
Actually riding horses.

1125
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,380
The horses are behind us.

1126
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380
Behind the two girls.

1127
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,180
Come on, let's go.

1128
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,860
It's okay.

1129
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,060
You really want to.

1130
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,460
You want to be the leading lady for once, right?

1131
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,020
Yes.

1132
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,940
Its ears are wearing headphones too.

1133
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,620
Let me do it, bro.

1134
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,020
Bro, let's handle the reins.

1135
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,420
Take a photo.

1136
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,020
Sure, no problem.

1137
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,540
You're much better behaved than the horses in Hengdian.

1138
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
I want to twirl my skirt.

1139
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,020
Okay.

1140
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,540
If you twirl your skirt, you'll scare it.

1141
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,140
Don't twirl, don't twirl, Jin Jing.

1142
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,300
Really?

1143
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,980
It'll get scared.

1144
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,980
It will be frightened.

1145
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,820
It's pretty timid.

1146
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,380
This horse is a bit stubborn.

1147
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,980
Let's hold hands.

1148
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,780
Okay, come on.

1149
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,340
Alright, look ahead.

1150
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,420
Okay, three, two, one.

1151
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,300
Look ahead.

1152
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,540
Done.

1153
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,980
Beautiful.

1154
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,260
Thank you.

1155
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,620
Thanks for your hard work.

1156
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,740
Zhang Linghe.

1157
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,740
What?

1158
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,500
So handsome.

1159
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,180
Handsome.

1160
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,180
White Dragon Horse, hooves facing west.

1161
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,620
You're about to kick me, aren't you?

1162
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,660
White Dragon Horse, hooves heading west

1163
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,340
A love

1164
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,220
exercise

1165
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,060
An unfinished

1166
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,540
to be continued

1167
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:36,940
Come

1168
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,780
Alright, light it up, teachers

1169
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,260
It's okay

1170
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,980
Don't worry, it's fine

1171
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Pull-up

1172
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,020
Season three is finished recording

1173
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,860
Lao Bai, do you feel a bit reluctant to leave?

1174
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,140
Reluctant, I'm very reluctant

1175
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,340
You've already started your break

1176
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,220
Found a nursing home

1177
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,620
Staying there for a while

1178
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,900
Thank you to all the staff and teachers

1179
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,300
All the dear teachers

1180
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,580
Looks great

1181
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,980
Looks great

1182
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,780
Looks great

1183
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,860
Over two hundred expressions

1184
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
My voice is hoarse today

1185
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,900
You cried here yesterday

1186
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,580
Down-and-out after returning from studying abroad

1187
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,780
The aloof young lady

1188
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,340
I don't believe you all can pass this round

1189
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,900
Show us the replay

1190
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,500
Pick up your own child

1191
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,780
Jiawei was just

1192
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
pulled up into the air, right?

1193
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,380
He was lifted up.

1194
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,340
His belly button was showing.

1195
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,180
Don't catch a cold, keep your stomach warm.

1196
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,180
Slim waist.

1197
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,980
When we air this episode,

1198
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,660
we'll clip this part out.

1199
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,500
If you don't help,

1200
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,140
we'll send this clip to the group.

1201
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,820
It's the most expensive meal treat.

1202
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,180
Send us a big red envelope first.

1203
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,060
Can you help me turn off the light?

1204
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,420
The light inside.
