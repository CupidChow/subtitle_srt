1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,600
The murderer who killed Tui Baiyi

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,240
has already been tracked down.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,640
It's just those two.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,680
But the news of Tui Baiyi's death

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,160
must not be leaked under any circumstances.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,800
Nothing can be allowed to affect

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,960
the progress of our company project.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,320
The Devil Training Camp will still be held as scheduled.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,360
Tui Baiyi's final work

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,120
is set against the backdrop of a biological infection at the end of the world.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,320
The actors disguise themselves as infected monsters

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,080
for audition selection.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,960
Stop.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,040
We're filming.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm acting.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
New actors

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,600
are invited to join the camp

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,360
but discover someone dressed in a monster costume

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,560
with a steel bar through their skull.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Lying in the ruins.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,640
The victim's identity is unknown.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,360
The killer's identity is unknown.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,280
Built upon the ruins of the past,

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,520
a new arena

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,960
What new truths

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,200
are waiting to be uncovered?

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
After a preliminary investigation,

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,760
the people involved in this case have been identified.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,560
I have a real alibi.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,320
There's nothing scary, right?

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,520
Bai Dapao, go quickly!

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Big Sister, lead us there.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,000
It's finally my turn today.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
No one should expect to have it easy.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't laugh.

36
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,440
You speak.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
Alright, let's hear from everyone one by one.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
I don't know him.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
If you don't know him, why would you kill him?

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Alright, the stress test is complete.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I don't know him.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
You don't know him either.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,120
Yes.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,440
Don't tell me you don't know him.

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,000
If anyone else says they don't know him,

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,280
I'll immediately lock them in the small room.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,920
I'll immediately lock them in the small room.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,200
I don't know him.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
Next, you speak.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,960
Afraid of me.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
I don't know him.

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,320
I don't know him.

53
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,560
I don't know him either.

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
Why are you flirting with her?

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,040
No.

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Because she said no one is allowed to say they don't know him.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
So I said, I don't know him either.

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
I really have to catch this murderer.

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
So who is he, really?

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,920
It's actually very important.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,600
Very important.

62
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,080
So everyone says

63
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
they don't know him.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
He could very likely be

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Right.

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
He might come for revenge.

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,240
And then someone found out.

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,760
Yes.

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,160
Afraid in their heart.

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Afraid of exposing themselves.

71
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
So they struck first.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Perfect.

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm giving you one last chance now.

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Step forward now.

75
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
If you keep playing,

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
it'll be too late.

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,280
What does this mean?

78
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Colored paint

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,080
If you hit a certain spot, colored paint will appear.

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,800
Isn't there color on that stone slab?

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,360
Check your phone.

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,560
Right.

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,120
What's the name of this device?

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,240
You've uncovered a huge secret.

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,200
You've uncovered a huge secret.

86
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
The target has been narrowed down.

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,960
Then the two of them got anxious.

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
Maybe something new will show up.

89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Keep going further in.

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,960
If you can't beat them, join them.

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,760
What are you doing?

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,680
Okay.

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,480
Alright.

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,880
As the savior,

95
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,600
I blended in with the zombies.

96
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Goodbye.

97
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,520
Their story hasn't come out yet.

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,440
We need to go take a look.

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Prince Charming.

100
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
Prince Charming.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
We grew up in an orphanage.

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:14,960
But he is...

103
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
He's the one, right?

104
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,600
I really am...

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,040
Speechless.

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,040
You made others play the seven dwarfs.

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,520
And then you...

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes, that's right.

109
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
I want myself in the future to...

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,080
Definitely must...

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
Become someone...

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
You can't even open this.

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
The next morning, when I checked,

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,400
it was trending.

115
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,040
It felt like the sky was falling.

116
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
Suddenly thought of something.

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
Being friends with someone like this...

118
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Stop.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
Wait a second.

120
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
Wait a second.

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,520
Wait, is this a living person?

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
Yes, it's a living person.

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
You're so soft.

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,840
Protect me.

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,880
Take it inside.

126
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
We need to finish this training soon.

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
Did you see who those five are?

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Then find those five according to what you saw.

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,680
That's right.

130
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

131
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
There's an earring on the left side.

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,200
They were just there a moment ago.

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
He was just at the table.

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,200
Remember, there's one more.

135
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
There's one with a middle part.

136
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
And a girl with straight bangs.

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
Very clear.

138
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,760
You are the one.

139
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,120
Could it be yours?

140
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,240
From him.

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,000
What does it mean to prove he didn't go back?

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,720
You're very suspicious today.

143
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
With the director.

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,080
Really.

145
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,640
He could very likely be ours.

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,320
Is the person in your car male or female?

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
At that time, on his body,

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
what did we find?

149
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Burns.

150
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
Burns on the hand.

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,880
Do you remember that extra from yesterday?

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,240
That extra gave us a piece of paper.

153
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,800
He said

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,000
He said he

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
It was open, he closed it.

156
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,000
He might be a

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Something happened to his body.

158
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,320
If

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,440
With him.

160
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,720
With that one from yesterday.

161
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
Assistant director.

162
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Is it related to the movie being filmed?

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,400
Yes.

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Open the door.

165
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
Then how did he get it?

166
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,040
So someone

167
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,480
gave this to him.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
That person is the killer.

169
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,680
It's possible.

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
So after being infected by the virus, they are

171
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
So this is real, they

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now Ba Mian Linglong

173
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
is very likely to become

174
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,160
There's one more.

175
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,360
It's fine, all done.

176
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,840
Okay, it's fine, don't run.

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
There's a wire on the head.

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't.

179
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
Kick, three, two, one.

180
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,080
Go.

181
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,800
You go first.

182
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
Let's remember their physical features.

183
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
For example, this person.

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
That person just now had a scar on his hand.

185
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
This one has no sleeves.

186
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
That one, this eye is blind.

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,520
This one has a broken leg.

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,080
Stuff like that.

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,640
Okay.

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Let's do this, the two of us will drag them in.

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Help them get inside.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay, good job, come on.

193
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,960
It's fine.

194
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Come on, rescue.

195
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,200
Slow down.

196
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm a pro at tug-of-war.

197
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,240
When I was a kid, I was called

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,920
the "Tug-of-War Prince".

199
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:25,960
"Tug-of-War Prince".

200
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,800
Pull.

201
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Let me ask, what exactly did you do?

202
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,120
You kicked the door and took my key.

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,200
You stop talking for now.

204
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,440
Wait a moment.

205
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Let me rest for a bit.

206
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Look, did you see that?

207
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,120
What is it?

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,200
After he does that,

209
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
he'll see what's inside.

210
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,720
Impossible.

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,080
No, he put a ruler in there.

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Is there a reason for that?

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
Is this his?

214
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,600
How tall am I?

215
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,520
Wait a second.

216
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,920
There's something on here.

217
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
So what's going on with this?

218
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,240
Why don't you explain?

219
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,920
I don't know about this, I've never seen it.

220
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,320
He has this wound on his hand.

221
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,200
This wound could be from...

222
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
Really?

223
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
I think this person might have been...

224
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,280
And he also has...

225
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,320
That's right.

226
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
Why do you think those two are there?

227
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,480
Actually, I don't think so.

228
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,040
Because you heard...

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,120
This sound, right?

230
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,560
Or something else?

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
That's not it, I...

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
What does that mean? I don't get it.

233
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,240
It's simple.

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
It's just that when I went there...

235
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,920
I didn't find anything else.

236
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,880
Didn't find anything.

237
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
Why do you think those two went there?

238
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,920
No way, that's not how it works.

239
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,280
No.

240
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,799
Hello.

241
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,799
Everyone's gathered.

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,400
Do you know someone with red hair?

243
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,080
You're just like an assistant director.

244
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
You're getting the hang of it, bro.

245
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
No, I'm trying to lock the suspect.

246
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Come on.

247
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,080
Use more force.

248
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,480
Impressive, you even know how to use pliers.

249
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,760
It's locked.

250
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,360
You even brought out the basin, bro.

251
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Bro.

252
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
Block the door.

253
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm blocking it.

254
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,840
Guys,

255
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Here it is.

256
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
He was probably

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,720
What?

258
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Right, so before him

259
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Yes.

260
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
It's possible.

261
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
The light I saw go out

262
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,840
was it the rehearsal light going out

263
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
or the light going out during the murder?

264
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,600
It doesn't matter.

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,040
He is...

266
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,720
Right, so the power went out three seconds after the light went off.

267
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,400
So their window to commit the crime

268
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
should be within this time frame.

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,120
Is that right?

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
I really...

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't have time to mess around with you.

272
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
I knew it.

273
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Stop arguing, you guys.

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
You still need to quietly find out

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
who the killer is.

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
How can we do this quietly?

277
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,400
Why haven't you called the police yet?

278
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
One, two, three.

279
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,240
One, two, three.

280
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,560
Go, one, two, three.

281
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,160
One, two, three.

282
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,600
One, two, three.

283
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,920
Okay, pause for a moment.

284
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,200
Someone here didn't bring gloves.

285
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,920
This first round is to test our courage.

286
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,240
Isn't that right?

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,720
No.

288
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
The first round tests our brotherhood.

289
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
Just now, when we were walking, Zhang Linghe...

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,800
Are you guys celebrities?

291
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,280
Why are you all so good-looking?

292
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,680
We're not as good-looking as you.

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
I found Prince Charming's WeChat, hurry!

294
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Look, you said my director, this is...

295
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,000
What am I trying to say?

296
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,680
It must be you.

297
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
But you're scared, you're timid.

298
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
You're afraid of being blacklisted.

299
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
So you told this director that...

300
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Yes.

301
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,520
This could be...

302
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
...something.

303
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,480
It's specifically to frame those two.

304
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
He needs to know both of these pieces of information.

305
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,600
Because first of all...

306
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
We weren't at the victim's place.

307
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
That's for sure.

308
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Right.

309
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,240
That also means...

310
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,520
The victim...

311
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,560
...wasn't discovered by anyone.

312
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
Even when the director came, didn't he also say...

313
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,640
When did it become like this?

314
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,200
Yes, that's right.

315
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
So it should be...

316
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
If he, because...

317
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,480
...of the cause of death...

318
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Then this person must have known him.

319
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,160
A hammer blow.

320
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
This is the key clue.

321
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,080
Right.

322
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,560
Yes.
