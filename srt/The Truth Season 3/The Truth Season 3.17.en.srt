1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
Two hundred years ago

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,320
there was a world-famous female pirate.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,720
Her ancestral home

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,240
was transformed into

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
a pirate mansion.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,600
A few days ago

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,400
Tui Houlang organized

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,920
an immersive exhibition.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,120
It was held to commemorate the life of Tui Sanniang.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,280
The invited guests included

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Everyone, guided by Tui Houlang,

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,640
began the first part of the exhibition.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,120
But just as it was nearing the end,

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,520
an accident occurred.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,760
Tui Houlang was found dead

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,480
in the water tank at the center of the exhibition hall.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,040
What was the reason behind all this?

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
The relevant characters have been unlocked.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,640
Hello, everyone.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,480
No matter how many difficulties I face,

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm He Chongchong, who insists on raising bugs.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
I found a gramophone.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,600
Found something good.

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,880
Come here.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
There's this kind of medicine here.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,040
What is this?

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,280
There's also a note.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,760
There's a method of committing a crime where you

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,680
trap someone

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Actually, inside you see a complete

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
So anyone could be involved.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,240
Including you.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,160
You've worked here for so long,

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
don't you know about this thing?

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,520
Could this cabinet be...

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040
It's time

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,200
to show your manly charm.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm scared.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
One.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
What should I do if I'm a little scared?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,320
I'll go with him.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,039
I'll go with him.

43
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, no problem.

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
There's someone behind you.

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Wait a second.

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,360
That scared me to death.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,080
It's okay.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,920
Save the brother.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
Save the brother later, save the beauty first.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,440
You, the detective.

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm really speechless at you, detective.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,480
Hello, everyone.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm the breakdance king.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,240
Ke Wuwangkuang.

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
No, it could just be one.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
So the killer then...

58
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,560
He then himself...

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,720
And then...

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
We broke in and saw this.

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
But we can't be sure about the earliest one.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
Because you don't know when.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,800
You also don't know when he acted.

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,520
This is a phone.

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
What is this thing?

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,280
I finish drawing on white paper, then draw on black paper.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,760
After drawing on black paper, I draw on the white paper's white part.

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,680
Fruit—I'll taste it to see if it's poisoned.

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Why is there bread in your room?

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,360
This kind of thing.

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,720
Right.

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
If that's the case,

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Then in the end...

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,600
Isn't that unnecessary?

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,280
Since he thinks...

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
That means I killed first.

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Let you experience my pain too.

78
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,440
Yes.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,360
It's obvious you know a lot about criminal psychology.

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
So your motive for killing him

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,920
is suspicion.

82
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,680
Not suspicion.

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
You just think he did the killing.

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,920
Alright, lock in the suspect.

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
Hello everyone, my name is Ba Jiaoshan.

86
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm twenty-three years old.

87
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm a folk singer.

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm very proud, and also very kind.

89
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
See, how natural I am.

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
You're amazing.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
One more suspect.

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
So you want to kill him.

93
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
No.

94
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,480
I think we're both suffering the same way.

95
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
But you think he should go.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,320
So you killed him.

97
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,760
What kind of villain am I?

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
How did you know about that?

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Couldn't find it. I saw it in his pocket.

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
Where did you see it?

101
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
In his pocket.

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
After I saw it, I searched online.

103
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
It wasn't in the pocket.

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,720
So you knew there was one.

105
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,960
Yes, I knew.

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,040
So I went around to the window to look.

107
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,680
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,120
Hello, everyone.

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
If you want to know who I am,

110
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,200
I am the most beautiful woman in the world.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,080
My name is Jin Shangbao.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,200
Everyone who sees me says I'm great.

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,880
No one is born an island.

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,920
Who is born without close relationships?

115
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Everyone is raised by their parents.

116
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
If you judge me for this,

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,280
I won't love you anymore.

118
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,080
It's wet.

119
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,720
"Jerk."

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Why are you secretly taking pictures of people?

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,960
Goodbye to you.

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,160
He told me his name.

123
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,960
So I really trusted him.

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,000
You're so naive.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,760
Anyone who found you would tell him you are.

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
No wonder you were running around over there.

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
So enthusiastic.

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
I thought you were a good person.

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
So you knew he wanted to.

130
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,920
That's right.

131
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Good night, young master.

132
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
Good morning, young lady.

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Today, tomorrow,

134
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,840
and the day after tomorrow,

135
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,000
I will be here

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
to welcome you every day.

137
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,600
Hello, everyone.

138
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,120
I am the receptionist here, Ning Reception.

139
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Are the six of us his ancestors or something?

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
It's possible.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm Liang Zhichao's grandmother.

142
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,640
You...

143
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,800
So it means he needs to prepare a set.

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Back to the exhibition hall.

145
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
So this proves one thing.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
That is...

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,640
Isn't it him?

148
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,960
Pushing the next generation means...

149
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,920
If we go by his theory,

150
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,760
it also means

151
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,200
the killer knows it's him.

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,720
You two are the main suspects now.

153
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,840
That's right, my big brother is correct.

154
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
So it wasn't you who did it.

155
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
I understand.

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
He is already dead.

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,080
What?

158
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
Don't doubt my big brother.

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,400
If you have a problem, come at me.

160
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Alright, so we can confirm one thing.

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
And that is, who is it?

162
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,480
Who is the killer?

163
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Brother, your deduction

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
is flawless.

165
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,760
Are you okay? That's such a big orange.

166
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
I finished eating it.

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:31,920
Yes.

168
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,640
I can't eat it.

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,120
I've been taking herbal medicine lately.

170
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,640
I can't eat anything colder than body temperature.

171
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,960
Come on, try to win some perks.

172
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,280
Alright, let's go.

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm telling you, today is just amazing.

174
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,000
I got my nails done just for this look today.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
And now I have to ruin my nails again.

176
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,400
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

177
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,160
Alright, let's do it.

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
It looks so good.

179
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,400
I really want to eat it.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,560
They all look great.

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,240
Who ate it?

182
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,480
Took out the insole.

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,559
I didn't use an insole.

184
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,520
Congratulations.

185
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,040
Good taste.

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm not eating anymore.

187
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,360
How is it?

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,120
Within two minutes, I guess.

189
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,240
Come on.

190
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,520
Three, two, one, go!

191
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,200
Okay.

192
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Strawberry cake.

193
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,960
You.

194
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
You look better every day.

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,920
Such a spendthrift.

196
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,560
Did you get taller again?

197
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,760
No, I didn't get taller.

198
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
We'll carry on for you.

199
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,440
Yes, that's right.

200
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,680
Alright.

201
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
You two.

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,200
It's done.

203
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Timer starts now.

204
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Great shot.

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,800
So pretty.

206
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
Who can say it? I can.

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,440
Dilraba.

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,080
It looks really delicious.

209
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
You look good every day.

210
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,360
Your elimination is honorable.

211
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,320
That's right, we're here to bargain.

212
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,960
It doesn't sound tasty at all.

213
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,840
Finished eating.

214
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,480
Congratulations, you completed the challenge.

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm speechless, I'm full now.

216
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,040
Are you ready?

217
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,320
Ready.

218
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay, let's start timing.

219
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
Do elbows count?

220
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,080
So handsome.

221
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,160
I want to eat.

222
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
You look good every day.

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,880
You ate it, right, Dai Mi?

224
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,240
You've grown a bit taller.

225
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,400
Let me do it.

226
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
You all figured it out.

227
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,720
You're in my heart.

228
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
If it were us,

229
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,920
If one of the five of us said this to him,

230
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
He'd probably say it's a bit gross.

231
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,720
If a fan said it, he'd say

232
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,360
Yes.

233
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,880
Your beauty has fallen.

234
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,560
Jin Jing doesn't say anything.

235
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,120
Just keeps smiling.

236
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,880
I've been taking Chinese medicine lately.

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,480
I can't eat anything below body temperature.

238
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,160
Are you ready?

239
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,560
Ready.

240
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,480
Please start your challenge.

241
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Okay.

242
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,080
Okay.

243
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
Okay.

244
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
When Jin Jing comes over and asks me

245
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,520
Who am I?

246
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
Am I Zhang Linghe?

247
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,960
Either is fine.

248
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,640
Both look good.

249
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
Zhang Linghe would say both look good.

250
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
Moo Moo, eat.

251
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay.

252
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,080
It's already peeled.

253
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,480
It's peeled, right?

254
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,800
Yes.

255
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,120
Then congratulations, we've completed the challenge.

256
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,600
Start the challenge.

257
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm really impressed.

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,320
You look beautiful every day.

259
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,760
Dai Mi, come here.

260
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,520
Sit down.

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,560
Come here.

262
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
Sit down.

263
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,840
You've grown, buddy.

264
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,320
Thanks for your hard work.

265
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,240
That was a carefully planned show.

266
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Your false eyelash fell off.

267
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,800
Alright, congratulations on passing the challenge.

268
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
One is the props room.

269
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
One is the cafeteria.

270
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,720
One is the convenience store.

271
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
Then I'll choose the cafeteria.

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Cafeteria.

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,440
Grand Slam Pizza

274
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,800
Red Lips Spicy Chicken Noodles

275
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,400
Northeast Mini Set Meal

276
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,480

277
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
Irresistibly Fragrant BBQ (Barbecue)

278
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
Everything Can Be Hotpot Party

279
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,000
Hotpot

280
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,680
Spicy Chicken Noodles

281
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,800
Spicy Chicken Noodles

282
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,240
Okay

283
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,280
Then let's have some BBQ (Barbecue)

284
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,120
Let's get some skewers

285
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Skewers might be easier for everyone to eat

286
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,760
Okay

287
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,800
I want the "Everything Can Be Hotpot" party

288
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,440
Alright

289
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,000
Thank you

290
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,400
Choose hotpot

291
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,960
Choose hotpot

292
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,080
Alright

293
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,240
Let's get the deluxe fruit platter

294
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
That way everyone can have some

295
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,760
The sunflower seeds are unlimited, right?

296
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,600
Then let's get sunflower seeds

297
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,720
This way, everyone can have some
