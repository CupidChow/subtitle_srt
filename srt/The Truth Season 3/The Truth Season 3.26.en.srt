1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,080
The game has failed this time.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,120
The real culprit is

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,480
He Chongchong.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
I am the real culprit in this case.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,240
The six of us were in the banquet hall

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,000
drinking and having a late-night snack

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
when Ren Weishan unexpectedly showed up.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,400
He stayed with us, eating and drinking.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
I didn't know what he was planning.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,280
I remembered when he checked in

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,000
with two bodyguards by his side.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,680
It was hard to find a moment when he was alone

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,000
so killing him was truly difficult.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,800
Maybe this was the only chance.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,240
But everyone was here.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
With so many eyes watching,

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
how could I make a move?

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
I recalled being in Ren Weishan's room

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,360
and besides finding

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,920
two files on his computer,

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,800
I also saw

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,680
two drugs developed by the Tuiyan Group that Ren Weishan promoted.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,720
One was called Tuiluanle

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,800
which can cause prosopagnosia.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,280
One is called "Tui Da Le".

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,600
It can cause people to lose their memory.

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
There are ten bottles of each drug.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,240
If I use these two drugs,

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
I can make everyone develop agnosia.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,600
Even if I do it in front of everyone,

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,880
and kill Ren Weishan,

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,800
they still won't realize I'm committing murder.

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,120
But what if everyone clearly

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,000
remembers these details

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
and eventually finds out?

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,680
So I also need to give them the memory-loss drug

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,240
to make absolutely sure nothing goes wrong.

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,280
I can use

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,200
a tool from the banquet hall to commit the murder.

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,320
And I hope this tool will disappear afterward.

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,760
So I decided to use liquid nitrogen

42
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
to freeze a dough ball and kill him with it.

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,760
Afterward, everyone will

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,200
make the dough into noodles and eat it.

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,840
This fits my plan perfectly.

46
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,640
I slipped out of the banquet hall

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
and went to Ren Weishan's room.

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,600
I took a bottle of "Tui Luan Le" and a bottle of "Tui Da Le".

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
I lit the barbecue grill

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,320
and turned up the flame

51
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,600
I changed the direction of the fan

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
so it blew into the room

53
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
to make sure everyone would inhale it

54
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,480
Because turning it up

55
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
makes everyone lose the ten minutes of memory before inhaling

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,400
and the twenty minutes after inhaling

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
So

58
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
no one would remember

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
that I just left the banquet hall

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,160
And I have to make sure

61
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
that within the next twenty minutes

62
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,200
I finish what I need to do

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,120
This way, everyone

64
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
will have absolutely no memory

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next, I need to urge Baizhihua

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
to quickly knead the dough

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Ten minutes later

68
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
the dough is ready

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
While no one is paying attention

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
I put on special gloves

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
and put the dough into the liquid nitrogen tank

72
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
The dough freezes quickly

73
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,200
I wrap the dough in plastic wrap

74
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,680
to prevent blood from getting on the dough

75
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
I sprayed everyone with Tuiluanle.

76
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Then I took the dough.

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
In front of everyone, I killed Ren Weishan with it.

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,280
I put the dough in a stainless steel bowl.

79
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,600
After melting it over the fire,

80
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,880
I secretly put the dough back on the cutting board.

81
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,280
Finally, I dragged Ren Weishan's body downstairs.

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
I threw the body into the river.

83
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,560
Because of Tuiluanle,

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
in the next twenty-four hours,

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,080
a red mark will appear on the neck.

86
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
So I sprayed myself with Tuiluanle as well.

87
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,480
To avoid being discovered.

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
Finally, I threw the used medicine

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,000
into the river as well.

90
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,400
After doing all this,

91
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,520
I lost my memory along with everyone else.

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Make a deduction.

93
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,720
Take a guess.

94
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,960
You just give me this and want me to deduce something?

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,600
Do you have any ideas?

96
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,200
No ideas.

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
What is this?

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
He Li touches Jin Yu.

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,280
Jin Yu.

100
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,480
From my own perspective,

101
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,880
Four, three, seven.

102
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,440
Chicken, two bears, two cows, two chickens.

103
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
One koala.

104
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
Number of times as the culprit.

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Number of wins.

106
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Number of times filming the show.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,240
How talkative they are.

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,720
Cat, dog, cow, lion, frog.

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,160
Rabbit, cow.

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Fox.

111
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
Cow, penguin, tiger, cat.

112
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Why does she have so many?

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,520
Bai Yu has fewer.

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Jin Jing.

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,520
Two chickens, two cows, two bears.

116
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,080
Why are there two bears?

117
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
Why are there two chickens?

118
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,840
Why are there two cows?

119
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Why are there...

120
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
Jin.

121
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,160
Jin Jing.

122
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,920
Each person has a small animal on their head.

123
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
Each one represents an English

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
letter.

125
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,360
These English letters are formed

126
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
from the pinyin of their names.

127
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,510
Jin Jing

128
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,950
Bai

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
Yu

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Liu Yuning, Zhou Keyu

131
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
Zhang

132
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
This one is "h".

133
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,120
The dog is "a".

134
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
The calf is "i".

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,880
h a i, "hai"

136
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
d, "haida"

137
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,480
o

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,640
island

139
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,080
pirate

140
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,600
pirate

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,360
Challenge completed successfully.

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Only one person.

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Push to explore.

144
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,920
Then I’ll definitely choose.

145
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,360
Why wouldn’t I choose?

146
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
Then I must choose her, I have to.

147
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,520
So today,

148
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,920
I choose Ba Jiaoshan as my X.

149
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,800
It seems like, in history,

150
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
this is our first time working together, right?

151
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,600
I hope we can turn the tide.

152
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,880
And win.

153
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,320
Choose.

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,560
I choose.

155
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,440
Then wouldn't that make you definitely X?

157
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,480
It depends on whether this person has a conscience.

158
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
But I don't like it when you're X.

159
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,960
Why?

160
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
Because it's more fun when you don't have a role.

161
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
Can a detective even be X?

162
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,240
I feel like it's very possible there's no X.

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,240
No.

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
Why not?

165
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,720
It's just a detective.

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
What's wrong with being a detective? I was X last time too.

167
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Last time, my detective was also X.

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
I ended up being X.

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Are you X?

170
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,760
Do you actually have a role right now?

171
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm X.

172
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,040
There is an X in this case.

173
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,240
Sorry, I'm the X for this episode.

174
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay.

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
Today, the two of us

176
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,280
really need to work together calmly.

177
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,040
Work together.

178
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't tell me you two are the killers.

179
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Then that's it, it's you again this time.

180
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,880
Who?

181
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,680
It's him.

182
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,960
I actually think it might be you.

183
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,480
It's me?

184
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Why?

185
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
I don't know, just a feeling.

186
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
It's my turn now.

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you think you're X today?

188
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
She must be the one today.

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,640
Wait a second.

190
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,560
If there's only one investigator,

191
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
do we still need X?

192
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
This person is so weak.

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
Next, we'll move on to the X confirmation round.

194
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,440
You're about to switch from innocent to cunning.

195
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
Let me say this first.

196
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,520
There are five suspects now.

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
If this person gets chosen again,

198
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,400
he's really just too weak.

199
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,240
And you still pick me as X.

200
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,360
Of course we have to pick.

201
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,320
How can someone be this weak?

202
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
She's talking about you.

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,080
She means you.

204
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
No, I'm just watching.

205
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Don't interrupt, I'm watching everyone.

206
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,480
Who's the culprit today?

207
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,640
Really weak.

208
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't pick me.

209
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
She's talking about you.

210
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
What you're saying now is useless.

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,600
They've already made their choice.

212
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
They chose a long time ago.

213
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,360
Yeah, I'm just saying the harsh truth up front.

214
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
If X really gets picked, that's just weak.

215
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
Yeah, we just look down on him.

216
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,160
Seriously.

217
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,200
If I were him, I wouldn't choose anymore.

218
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Why make things hard for this girl?

219
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,840
I'll just do it myself today.

220
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm going solo.

221
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Not just today.

222
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
You wanted to go solo yesterday too.

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,880
You don't need today for that.

224
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,080
I believe you can go solo.

225
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,200
But I really don't believe anyone else would dare go solo.

226
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,960
You don't dare?

227
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,680
I don't dare.

228
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,040
Confirm

229
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
So weak

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Look at her

231
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
Ba

232
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,560
Why do you seem like you want to say something but hold back?

233
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Too obvious

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
I feel like she wants to come in and scold someone, saying

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
"Killer, I really look down on you"

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,440
Then she thought, if she actually said that

237
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,600
No

238
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
Now I think

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
He is very confident

240
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,600
What do you mean?

241
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
No one picked her as X, right

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Let's go search the second area

243
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,480
Talk while we walk

244
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,760
But there's a problem

245
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
But there's a problem

246
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,840
Go ahead

247
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
I am X

248
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,680
I am X

249
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,560
What?

250
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,920
And then?

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
So who is the killer among you?

252
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Because each of you contacted me

253
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
This is so frustrating

254
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,040
Wait a second

255
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
Why did everyone message me?

256
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Wait a second

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Why is it like this?

258
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,200
Wait a second

259
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,040
Okay

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,720
Okay

261
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Alright

262
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,680
I feel really sorry for her

263
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,760
It's hard to decide right now

264
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
We can set a code word

265
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
There's no voting format yet

266
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,280
We can set a code word for each person

267
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
I blended in with everyone.

268
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,360
He wanted everyone to set a code word.

269
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,280
I can blend in anywhere.

270
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
I said, "Nuannuan, it's me."

271
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,640
She should know who I am now.

272
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,560
She didn't reply to me.

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
Could she be talking to someone else?

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Maybe she's communicating with another person.

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
Today, this is really complicated.

276
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
So she probably doesn't have any good ideas either.

277
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,920
It's okay.

278
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,240
Let's play it by ear.

279
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,560
These people know.

280
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,840
Are all of them contacting me?

281
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,600
I don't know.

282
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm really speechless.

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,640
Who do you think we should vote for?

284
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,160
I feel like it's either He or Ning.

285
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Wait a second.

286
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,640
Okay, we're done talking.

287
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,920
I think...

288
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm Jin Jing.

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,760
She isn't replying to me.

290
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,120
She doesn't like me anymore.

291
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
Surely not five people have all messaged her, right?

292
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,360
Did someone call her?

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,360
Do you want to call?

294
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,160
I want to call.

295
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
We can't do a video call, right?

296
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Why didn't you choose me?

297
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,680
What do you mean by "didn't choose you"?

298
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,360
Did you choose me?

299
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
Choose you for what?

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
How many people have contacted you?

301
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
What do you mean, how many people have contacted me?

302
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
X contacted you.

303
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,400
No, did the culprit contact you?

304
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,600
Didn't you just call me?

305
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
And you're still asking if anyone contacted me?

306
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm the only one who contacted you.

307
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,120
Right.

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,760
But you can't...

309
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,000
You can't be too loud, right?

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,560
You want to now...

311
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,280
It's fine.

312
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm hiding in a very safe place.

313
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Let me tell you something.

314
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm not the killer.

315
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,000
Can someone who's not the killer contact me?

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
No.

317
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
It's just from discovering the body

318
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
that I noticed a loophole.

319
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,800
That's not how I killed him.

320
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,920
And the way I killed him was really strange.

321
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,120
I killed him in the dark.

322
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,280
I was...

323
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,320
Ning closed the door to this room

324
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
and after it was shut,

325
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
I thought he stayed inside.

326
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
So I went back to kill him.

327
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
In the dark, I assumed he was sitting there.

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,520
I hit him with a bottle and killed him.

329
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,640
But I actually didn't check

330
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,360
if he was really dead.

331
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,880
So you're saying you're not the killer.

332
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,920
You didn't kill him.

333
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,800
I don't think I'm the killer.

334
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
So even if you're not the killer, you can still contact me.

335
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Okay.

336
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,920
See you in a bit.

337
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,440
Goodbye.

338
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,240
The messiest ever.

339
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,160
Alright, here’s how we’re going to play today.

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
I admit I contacted her.

341
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,400
I think I’m the killer.

342
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,560
You must also think you’re the killer.

343
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,520
You also think you’re the killer.

344
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,720
You definitely think you’re the killer too.

345
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,080
I think so too.

346
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,560
You think so too.

347
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,840
So among the five of us,

348
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,520
only one person is

349
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,920
the one who actually killed him.

350
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,360
I want to say something seriously.

351
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
I think this season

352
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
we had a great time filming.

353
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,640
The six of us have already

354
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
gone from friends to family.

355
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
If each of us stabbed once,

356
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
then we’ll take responsibility together.

357
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
Let’s not solve this case.

358
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,160
We won’t solve it.

359
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,640
Come on.

360
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Let’s catch our flight.

361
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
No need to solve it, he deserved to die.

362
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,800
He deserved to die.

363
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,080
Alright, three, two, one.

364
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,480
Three, two, one.

365
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,240
Safe travels.

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,800
No, rest in peace.

367
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,480
Come on, three, two.

368
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
Rest in peace.

369
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,440
Three, two, one.

370
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,880
Rest in peace.

371
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,760
Goodbye, it’s a wrap.

372
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
Alright, goodbye.

373
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
We’ve finished filming, goodbye.

374
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
We still need to present the whole case

375
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,880
to the audience.

376
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,440
All five people chose X.

377
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
They all picked her.

378
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,960
That’s right.

379
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,640
That's why all five people contacted her.

380
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,920
They could only choose me, there was no one else.

381
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,320
There was no one else.

382
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,480
All five people chose X, right?

383
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,440
Yes.

384
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
No one didn't choose.

385
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,760
Yes, that's how the game works.

386
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes.

387
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
You had to choose, right?

388
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,200
Alright, it doesn't matter.

389
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,920
Okay.

390
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,200
It doesn't matter.

391
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's search, come on.

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Let's search first, let's go to the banquet hall.

393
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
I know why you suddenly got stuck.

394
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Because you already know who the real culprit is.

395
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,000
You're helping him play now.

396
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,200
You're a good person.

397
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,960
You're not in this state, right?

398
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,640
Mainly, you all keep discussing.

399
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,080
You're talking about where you committed the murder.

400
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,680
How would I know where you did it?

401
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,840
You're overthinking it, she doesn't have any clues.

402
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
No, five people sent her messages.

403
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,880
They all contacted her.

404
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,120
She still has to figure out who that person is.

405
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, I'm the same as you.

406
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
If you're not the culprit,

407
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm just like you now.

408
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,120
Each of you says

409
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,520
you're the culprit.

410
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
I want to ask you

411
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
If you know who the culprit is

412
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,440
are you going to help them play?

413
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,680
Help who?

414
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,200
The culprit.

415
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,040
I still don't know

416
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,000
who the culprit is.

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
But I feel like it's definitely not you.

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
But you must be

419
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,640
If the culprit wins

420
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,080
then you can get the key, right?

421
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
Right.

422
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,840
Because no matter what, she's the villain today.

423
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
She's the villain no matter what.

424
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,440
Even though she's doing the right thing now

425
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,600
she must still be the villain.

426
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
I think from just now

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
she's already started being a bit dishonest.

428
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,240
Dishonest.

429
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
I still don't know who it is.

430
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,200
It's true.

431
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
This container can store low-temperature liquid nitrogen.

432
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
After rapidly freezing the dough

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,640
it turns into a big iron ball.

434
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,200
I think there's a big problem with A.

435
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
Because A was grilling skewers.

436
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
He was barbecuing outside.

437
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,560
He covered his nose himself.

438
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,520
We couldn't see it.

439
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,320
I want to make a point.

440
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,720
And what is the other point?

441
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,600
This murderer

442
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
must have been able to get these two medicines.

443
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes, that's the most important thing.

444
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,320
First, he should know

445
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,600
about these two products.

446
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,360
In 2025,

447
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,920
they were produced on March 1st.

448
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
He needs to know this clue.

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,590
He can only proceed after getting these two medicines.

450
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,590
No, these two medicines belong to Ren Weishan.

451
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,280
Who said that?

452
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,200
Where did you find that information?

453
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Ren Weishan's phone.

454
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,920
That's right, but think about it first.

455
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,440
This is information sent later.

456
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,110
The premise is

457
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,830
when he wanted to kill Ren Weishan,

458
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,200
this thing

459
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,280
he already knew it existed.

460
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,200
Give me the phone.

461
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,640
See? He wrote it.

462
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,200
The deputy gave me two fewer bottles of medicine.

463
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,440
These two medicines

464
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,760
were always kept by you before.

465
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
When they were taken from your room last night,

466
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,320
they were missing.

467
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,680
Yes, he discovered it last night.

468
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Someone took them from Ren Weishan's room.

469
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
They took these two medicines from his bedroom.

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,680
Yes, he saw it at the scene.

471
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Then he came up with this plan.

472
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,440
Really?

473
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,080
Yes.

474
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I know what the key evidence is.

475
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,160
It must be on one of our clothes.

476
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
The one with flour on it.

477
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,440
But we've all changed clothes.

478
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,880
Wait a second.

479
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,040
Wait, we can rule out one more person.

480
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
This happened at the same time.

481
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Didn't someone say it wasn't white cotton candy?

482
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,560
So that person can't tell the material apart.

483
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,600
Then we can rule out anyone who can't tell the material.

484
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,240
Right?

485
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,640
That's right.

486
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,040
Who can't tell the material?

487
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,920
Me.

488
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
I can't tell the material.

489
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,720
He can't tell the material either.

490
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,400
I can't tell the material either.

491
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
He can't tell the material either.

492
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,560
What is an egg without its shell?

493
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,200
The size.

494
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,080
Who can't tell the size?

495
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,480
Me

496
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
My arm

497
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,520
He can't tell the size either

498
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,960
Right

499
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,440
Okay

500
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Classic either-or choice

501
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
If the two of us can't tell the size apart

502
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,320
Can't be ruled out

503
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
Why can't you two tell the material apart

504
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,080
and get ruled out

505
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
Because I spoke

506
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,960
I said

507
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,040
Isn't it white cotton candy?

508
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah

509
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,200
So?

510
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,480
You can rule that out

511
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
The person who said that isn't the culprit

512
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,520
But you can't be sure

513
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,160
that the person who said it is you

514
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,760
Why do you

515
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
think the person who said it is you?

516
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
You also can't tell the material apart

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
So many people can't tell the material apart

518
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
Special healing ointment

519
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,440
He was working with the dough and his hand got frostbitten

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
He knew his hand was frostbitten

521
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Yeah, he needs to use this medicine

522
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,680
This container can store low-temperature liquid nitrogen

523
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,760
After freezing the dough rapidly

524
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,400
it turns into a big iron ball

525
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,600
Who is it

526
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,000
Hurry up

527
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Just say it directly

528
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Whose message to you is the most suspicious

529
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
All five of you sent messages

530
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
Look, according to our current

531
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,120
reasoning logic as six people,

532
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
the conclusion we've reached is

533
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
the killer didn't inhale the poison.

534
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,160
Right?

535
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,760
So the killer didn't lose their memory.

536
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,360
So this killer

537
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,320
must know they're the killer right now.

538
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,480
Why didn't the killer lose their memory?

539
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,400
Because after inhaling the poison,

540
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,040
he wouldn't know what he used to hit the victim.

541
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,520
But before inhaling the poison,

542
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,360
I already knew I was going to use this to commit the crime.

543
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,440
So I would know where that thing is.

544
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,040
After he was hallucinated,

545
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,600
he also wouldn't know

546
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
what kind of hallucination he had.

547
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,480
Right.

548
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,080
Today, I'm the killer.

549
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm the killer.

550
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,080
Before I inhaled the drug,

551
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,520
I knew I was going to use this dough

552
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
to hit and kill him.

553
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,960
So I would know the dough is here.

554
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,320
You just need to knead the dough again.

555
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,560
Even if I inhaled the drug,

556
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,440
and saw it as a black ball,

557
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,240
I would still know it's dough.

558
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,680
I could just pick it up and hit him, right?

559
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
I think what he just said was correct.

560
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,840
Why would I need to do it again later

561
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
just like you all did,

562
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,280
when supposedly I've already been hallucinated,

563
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,160
and then fake-kill him again?

564
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,200
It's about the matter of turning off the lights.

565
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
Since everyone has already

566
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
completely gone back

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
and all passed out,

568
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
why could Ning still come back to turn off the lights?

569
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,880
Today was actually a bit too difficult.

570
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,840
I think today was a bit hard.

571
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
If we go purely by behavior,

572
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,800
Do you think He is suspicious?

573
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,600
Based on behavior alone, I don't think he's suspicious.

574
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,800
You think he seemed relaxed, right?

575
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
He wasn't relaxed.

576
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
Today, he...

577
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,000
It's hard to say.

578
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,720
Actually, ever since his behavior that time,

579
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,400
after I misread him,

580
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,720
I stopped judging based on behavior.

581
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,600
I voted for...

582
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,120
Ning.

583
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,360
I voted for...

584
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,840
Ning.

585
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,600
My pick for the culprit today is...

586
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,280
Ning Reception.

587
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,360
The culprit this time is...

588
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,840
Ning.

589
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
So in the end, I cast my vote for...

590
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Ke.

591
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
I think the culprit is...

592
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
He Chongchong.

593
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,360
This round was a failure.

594
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,400
The real culprit is...

595
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
He Chongchong.

596
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,800
I think just being alone

597
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,560
having this

598
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,320
and having to do something difficult

599
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,400
is already very hard for me

600
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
because even when two people are investigating together

601
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,640
I still find it a bit difficult

602
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
and if you have to lead everyone

603
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,760
so today, being both the X and the investigator

604
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,280
all these roles were on me

605
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
I am the MVP

606
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,800
the MVP of the fourth episode

607
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,040
in my mind, of course, that's me

608
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes

609
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,560
Yes, I successfully escaped everyone's

610
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,840
sharp eyes

611
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
But even though I'm the MVP

612
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,760
in my mind it's me

613
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
I still don't encourage learning from He Chongchong

614
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,640
Because He Chongchong

615
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
even though he did it to protect

616
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
someone important to him

617
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,120
he could have used

618
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,240
reasonable and legal means to protect them

619
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
instead of such extreme methods

620
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,560
Yes, that's all

621
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,640
Everyone must obey the law

622
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
Ling He and Sister Ba

623
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
the two of them also

624
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
cooperated seamlessly together

625
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Sister Ba also played very well

626
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,440
did a great job as the X

627
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
I hope one day I can also

628
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,520
learn to play the X role like them

629
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,160
I think it's Ning too.

630
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
Because of what he said to me today,

631
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,160
he was really sincere.

632
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,240
He told me at the end,

633
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
if I were the culprit,

634
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
he would go home and cry a lot.

635
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,480
In the end, it wasn't me.

636
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,080
It definitely has to go to Jin Jing.

637
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
Because actually,

638
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,880
today was

639
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
a relatively difficult case.

640
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
And everything about it

641
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
was quite complicated.

642
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
But in the end, only

643
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,280
even the culprit

644
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,720
was confused today.

645
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,040
But by the end,

646
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,600
the only person who guessed right was

647
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,960
Jin Jing.

648
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
So I think

649
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
in such a chaotic situation,

650
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
being able to pick out the culprit

651
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,640
no matter what her reasoning was,

652
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
she really was today’s

653
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,680
MVP among us civilians.

654
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,560
Jin.

655
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,720
She was the only one who guessed right.

656
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,600
That's really impressive.

657
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
The reason I didn't guess right

658
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,920
is that I'm not good enough.

659
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,240
And I was blindly confident.
