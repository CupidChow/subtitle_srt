1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,220
Don't bring them out separately.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,140
Just put them all there.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,580
Let's move the chairs over and eat together.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,780
You haven't played X Game.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,540
X Game.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,700
You won't play detective either.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,460
You're still trying to get information out of me.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,980
Why is there a smudge on your face?

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,780
The symbol of X.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,980
This rice smells so good.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,340
This corpse has its feet sticking up right here.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,660
Put it here.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,580
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,620
We'll start eating first.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,620
I just think that scary stuff

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,060
really drains my energy.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,500
It's my first time with the Chinese style.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,820
But actually, what I fear most is the Chinese style.

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,900
The immersion in the Chinese style is stronger.

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,980
Because it's so close to my own life.

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,180
At least during this process,

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,460
as long as I'm happy, isn't that enough?

23
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,740
Winning or losing is of course important,

24
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,580
but the happiness in the process

25
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,940
isn't something that winning or losing can decide.

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,660
Indeed, I need to learn this from Bai.

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,660
He cares about what matters to him.

28
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,940
Because today we

29
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,300
went through some special segments.

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,180
So the production team prepared red envelopes.

31
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,620
Okay.

32
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,620
Thank you.

33
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:03,980
Thank you.

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,380
No, it's really a lot.

35
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,940
Really?

36
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,420
Seriously?

37
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,460
You really don't have to do this.

38
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,740
Are you not paying the final payment?

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,580
Bro, do you think it's too much?

40
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,900
Share some with me.

41
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,980
Why don't we eat something first?

42
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,500
Then we can discuss while eating.

43
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,420
Okay.

44
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
Alright.

45
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,020
Then call Grandpa Tai to have the food delivered.

46
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,020
Come on, bro, have a seat.

47
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
The problem is, I'm not hungry.

48
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,460
We just ate at four o'clock.

49
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,500
I didn't eat, you guys did.

50
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,860
You didn't eat back then?

51
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,740
You didn't eat?

52
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,380
Yeah.

53
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,340
So what were you doing then?

54
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,100
Nothing, I just didn't want to eat.

55
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,620
I ate too much in the morning.

56
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,420
I was contacting that X.

57
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,860
I was in touch for twenty minutes.

58
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,220
No.

59
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,500
I watched our clips for a while.

60
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,020
I just didn't feel like eating then.

61
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,660
I knew that at night

62
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,900
we could eat what they gave us.

63
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,860
You haven't played the X game.

64
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,140
The X game.

65
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,300
You don't play deduction games either.

66
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,220
And you still want to get information out of me.

67
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,180
Who won that game?

68
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,300
Did you win?

69
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,180
Those things from the snack shop.

70
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,620
No.

71
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,140
Do you remember the time I chose you?

72
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,180
Do you know which game it was?

73
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,620
Which one?

74
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,060
The one from "Squid Game."

75
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,540
The sugar honeycomb.

76
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,380
The honeycomb game.

77
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,940
Scraping it out.

78
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,220
Right.

79
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,500
That one is really fun.

80
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,140
Don't serve them separately.

81
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,060
Just put them all there.

82
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,299
Let's move the chairs over and eat together.

83
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,500
Watch your hands, be careful.

84
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,140
There are gloves over there, do you want to wear one?

85
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,500
Thank you, you've worked hard.

86
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,020
Let's get a little closer, okay?

87
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,380
I think above the moon

88
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,860
this episode won't be for nothing.

89
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,820
Just give her a murderer directly.

90
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,980
Can she handle us bombarding her like this?

91
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,620
Are you used to it?

92
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,860
It doesn't really work on me.

93
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you used to this?

94
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm used to it.

95
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,620
Are you okay now?

96
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,740
It's you.

97
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,180
We really have to put some pressure on you.

98
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,500
She's not even tired, right?

99
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,340
How can you guys record for three days straight?

100
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,660
We're very happy.

101
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,740
This episode isn't even physically demanding.

102
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,140
We even have episodes where we climb mountains and cross rivers.

103
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,700
I mainly feel like my mind isn't clear.

104
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,060
Physically, I'm fine.

105
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,900
Mainly because this person is here.

106
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,020
Alright, I don't suspect Ning anymore.

107
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,620
At this moment.

108
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,260
It doesn't matter.

109
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,140
Actually, this game, I really...

110
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,300
Whether I win or not doesn't really matter to me now.

111
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,140
I'll only know after I watch the show later.

112
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,940
Winning or not isn't important.

113
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,340
The process is really fun.

114
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,940
It's pretty good.

115
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,580
This food smells so good.

116
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,980
This corpse just has its feet sticking up here.

117
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,300
Just put it here.

118
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,740
Sorry about this, sir.

119
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,860
We'll eat first.

120
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,420
No, you should come over here to eat.

121
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,300
It's fine.

122
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
You can't reach the dishes from there.

123
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,380
It's okay.

124
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,500
Like this.

125
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,420
Otherwise, he can't reach.

126
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,180
Pull that one over.

127
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,780
No need, I'm not eating.

128
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,700
You're really not eating?

129
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,060
I'm not eating.

130
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,500
I just finished eating, I really can't eat anymore.

131
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,900
I just had a big bowl of rice at four o'clock.

132
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,740
Then come over and sit for a while, let's chat.

133
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,340
I'll chat, I'll chat with you all.

134
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,740
He's avoiding you now.

135
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,940
This way you can get it, right?

136
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,820
I hate this killer.

137
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,580
When I finally find out who the killer is,

138
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll hit him with this stick.

139
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,300
Isn't it him?

140
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,340
When the truth is finally revealed,

141
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,140
What if it's a girl?

142
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,820
Would you hit her?

143
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,340
I'd still hit her.

144
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,300
They didn't give us any paper.

145
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
What kind of paper do you need? I'll get it for you.

146
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,140
I'll go get it.

147
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,620
Who's eating?

148
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,379
Are you eating, sis?

149
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:29,379
No.

150
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,939
I just ate a little after four too.

151
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,660
Are you eating, Yue?

152
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,020
I can skip it too.

153
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,780
Yue, are you dieting?

154
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,540
I've been dieting all along, sticking to it.

155
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,300
Has it worked?

156
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,260
Doesn't seem to have much effect.

157
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,740
But I think you look slimmer now.

158
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,060
A little slimmer, maybe.

159
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,540
Have a little.

160
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,860
Okay.

161
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,860
No, I'm not dieting.

162
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm recording this show.

163
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,020
I eat mint candies every day until I'm full.

164
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,060
Why do you keep eating them?

165
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,420
Just to stay alert.

166
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,100
Come on, let's do the off-stage segment.

167
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,260
Off-stage segment.

168
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,860
Let's do it.

169
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,260
I think it should be Yue.

170
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,660
It's her first time here, they wouldn't let her...

171
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,460
I don't think it's her.

172
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,260
She doesn't seem like it.

173
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,660
So we have a one-in-three chance.

174
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,700
Right.

175
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,060
If it's one out of three...

176
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,020
I really think once Bai gets into this kind of...

177
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,180
very crazy state,

178
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,940
he doesn't seem like the culprit.

179
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,460
He just doesn't, yeah.

180
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,300
So it's between you two.

181
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,700
The tissues are placed to the side.

182
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,700
Thank you.

183
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,340
Are you going to eat?

184
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm really full.

185
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,940
Have some.

186
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,820
Why don't you have a couple of bites?

187
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,300
Otherwise, what if we start recording soon?

188
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,740
It's fine, I won't eat anymore.

189
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,700
I ate at four o'clock, I'm really too full.

190
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,540
Me too, I ate a lot.

191
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,620
Forget it, I won't waste it either.

192
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,460
Let's say we're just playing off the field right now.

193
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,420
Let's say we're just playing off the field right now.

194
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,340
It's impossible for Yue to be the culprit on her first time here.

195
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,460
You can't rule someone out just because it's their first time.

196
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,580
I don't think she seems like it.

197
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,940
Because I've already said this.

198
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,700
Otherwise, my nerves would be way too strong.

199
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
I'm not that kind of person.

200
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,380
Yeah, if she really is that impressive,

201
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,780
Turns out you really are that impressive.

202
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,980
Then the answer is just written right on the surface.

203
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm not that impressive.

204
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,700
Really?

205
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm that impressive?

206
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,580
Next year I'll go for the Magnolia Award.

207
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,820
It's not impossible.

208
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,220
Who knows, it's the future.

209
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,340
She's giving you a stress test.

210
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,140
You, an X.

211
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,420
What kind of stress test are you giving people?

212
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,420
Why is there a black smudge on your face?

213
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't know.

214
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,700
I got it from rubbing against the inside of that coffin.

215
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,500
The mark of X.

216
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,620
It means this person has a stain on them.

217
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,260
If I had to choose between the two of you,

218
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,420
Today, I lean towards...

219
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,420
I can't make eye contact with you.

220
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,300
So spicy.

221
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,780
Which dish is so spicy?

222
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,780
Can I, as an outsider, say something?

223
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,900
You can, go ahead.

224
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,460
Let's hear it.

225
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,820
What did you say to me?

226
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
I said you look like the culprit.

227
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,380
And then you got really, really flustered.

228
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,980
I asked, what's wrong with you?

229
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,740
You can say it, go ahead, say it.

230
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,020
No problem.

231
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,340
I feel like that's not how you usually are.

232
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,220
You think it's the younger brother.

233
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,100
What does the younger brother think?

234
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,260
I don't want to say right now.

235
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,660
Don't want to say.

236
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Yeah, I have someone in mind.

237
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,540
But I don't want to say.

238
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
You have someone in mind?

239
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,700
Who?

240
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Don't want to say.

241
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,660
Yue, who do you think it is?

242
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,580
I think it's either you or Ning.

243
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,860
Why?

244
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,540
Give your reason.

245
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,140
Because I know it's not me.

246
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,780
And I feel like it's not him.

247
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,380
Then it must be him.

248
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,020
He's close to the old man.

249
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,980
Him?

250
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm in the back.

251
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,380
Yeah.

252
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,380
What's up with you?

253
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,020
This little design of yours is really interesting.

254
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,140
This sunflower seed thing—

255
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,340
Did your stylist do this for you?

256
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,740
Yeah.

257
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,180
Of course, that's your style.

258
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,180
Last time it was pistachios.

259
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,100
So, how is it being on this show?

260
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,060
Is it fun?

261
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm exhausted.

262
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,660
Already worn out?

263
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
I haven't even used my brain yet.

264
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,420
It's tough because it's your first time here.

265
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,060
Yeah.

266
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,100
She has to go to that—

267
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,620
The one where we climbed the building.

268
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,940
With the ropes.

269
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,780
I remember at first we were climbing up with all our strength.

270
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,180
When we got to the fifth or sixth floor, you said—

271
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,340
Forget it.

272
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,740
Let's stop climbing.

273
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,940
It's airing today.

274
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,780
What's airing today is—

275
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,420
Which one is airing?

276
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,460
No.

277
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,820
Today they're airing that one episode—

278
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,940
They're airing our escape episode.

279
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,140
It's the "Killing Livestream" episode.

280
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,300
Yeah, the "Killing Livestream" one.

281
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,340
They're showing your pull-ups.

282
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,860
What pull-ups?

283
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,260
You're over there.

284
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,700
Today's whole session

285
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,060
is still mainly focused on brain teasers.

286
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,900
This time, there’s no running or anything like that.

287
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,980
Today is pretty tough.

288
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,580
I just think scary stuff

289
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,740
really drains my energy.

290
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,620
No, it’s usually scary too.

291
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,860
But this is the first time it’s Chinese-style.

292
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,259
Actually, I’m most afraid of the Chinese-style ones.

293
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,820
Me too, I’m really scared of them.

294
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
The Chinese style feels more immersive.

295
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,659
Because it’s so close to our real lives.

296
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,980
Yeah, things like zombies are a bit better.

297
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,940
Dinosaurs and stuff like that are also easier to handle.

298
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,659
I like vampires the most.

299
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,300
Vampires, yeah, the coolest kind.

300
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Actually, for us

301
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,780
today is considered pretty scary.

302
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,980
It’s really scary.

303
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,060
I think tomorrow will be even scarier.

304
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,300
Both these days will be quite scary.

305
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,460
Just think about it.

306
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,300
Tomorrow we have to wear long robes.

307
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,660
And the NPCs that show up

308
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,180
will also be

309
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,860
the floating kind.

310
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,620
Today’s session

311
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,540
has a strong focus on logic too.

312
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,620
The math part is pretty hard.

313
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,860
What are we supposed to figure out?

314
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,900
We’re better at dealing with mechanisms and stuff.

315
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,980
Yeah, usually for these high-difficulty cases

316
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,340
only Ning can pull it off.

317
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,500
No way.

318
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,660
Last time

319
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,140
Last time

320
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,940
When did you ever do a high-difficulty case?

321
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,540
Come on, tell us.

322
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,380
You guys can take this and eat it too.

323
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,140
You can have the eggs and everything inside.

324
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,620
I’m not eating.

325
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,780
There’s also a new boxed meal.

326
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,660
What?

327
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I’m not eating, you can take the food inside.

328
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,740
That’s enough, it’s the same.

329
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,380
That’s enough, there’s still another box over there.

330
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,620
Enough.

331
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,380
Mainly, I don’t really know you guys.

332
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,660
So I can’t really get much from it.

333
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,900
Yeah, that’s true.

334
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,620
Yeah, I’m the same as you.

335
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,820
You’re the same as her.

336
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
When I first came in season two,

337
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,020
Really.

338
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,460
If it’s a really close friend,

339
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,500
Honestly, just one look and you feel like they’re acting suspicious.

340
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,660
But actually, it’s hard to tell.

341
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,180
Actually, you can’t really tell.

342
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
Even later on, we still can’t.

343
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,980
Yeah.

344
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Because at first, everyone’s scared.

345
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,740
Everyone’s also afraid of being watched by others off the field.

346
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,900
Later on, no one’s scared anymore.

347
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,060
Yeah, we got used to it.

348
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,420
Yeah.

349
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
Why do you think Ning is the culprit?

350
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,460
How did you figure out it was him step by step?

351
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,580
I just reasoned it out step by step in my mind.

352
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,900
Was it hard?

353
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,580
It’s doable.

354
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,780
Last time, you were sure it was He.

355
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,220
Do you remember how you did it in the end?

356
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,020
Yeah, just follow your heart.

357
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,900
So who do you think is X, between the two of us?

358
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
You’re X.

359
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,420
And I’m on Ning’s side.

360
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,260
Yeah.

361
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,260
Even if I get it wrong again this time,

362
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,220
you still won't change anything about yourself.

363
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,380
I won't change.

364
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,740
You'll never think the way I do.

365
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,380
About what exactly is wrong with yourself.

366
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,700
At least during this process,

367
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
as long as I'm happy, isn't that enough?

368
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,940
Then why should I

369
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,460
Right.

370
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,060
You live so philosophically, I should learn from you.

371
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,780
Winning or losing is just that—winning or losing.

372
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,020
Of course, winning and losing are important.

373
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,140
But the happiness in the process—

374
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,940
isn't something that winning or losing can determine.

375
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,380
You're amazing. I want to learn from you.

376
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,020
Don't learn from me.

377
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,060
I don't pay attention to things.

378
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,420
Don't learn from me.

379
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,300
You have no mind for the past, no mind for the present,

380
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,260
and no mind for the future either.

381
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,540
And even less a sense of shame.

382
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,420
That's right.

383
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,660
He just has no heart.

384
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,180
Why are you two arguing again?

385
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm just a heartless person.

386
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,020
An empty-hearted person.

387
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,620
Yes, in this regard, you should learn from Bai.

388
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,140
What?

389
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,740
No matter how many mistakes he makes, no matter what happens,

390
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,500
he never keeps it in his heart.

391
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,900
No, let me tell you, it's like this.

392
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,220
He actually does keep it in his heart.

393
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,780
Really.

394
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,860
But you think he doesn't show any emotion.

395
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,700
He actually does.

396
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,340
He cares.

397
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,220
He has a lot of feelings.

398
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,300
He cares about the things that matter to him.

399
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,100
But things that have nothing to do with him,

400
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,020
he doesn't care about at all.

401
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,740
That's the kind of person he is.

402
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,180
He thinks we have nothing to do with him.

403
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,420
So he...

404
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,780
Yeah.

405
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,380
Yeah.

406
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,660
Yeah.

407
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,420
Isn't that just my personality?

408
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Only Capricorns act like that.

409
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,420
You?

410
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,020
Actually, most Capricorns are like this.

411
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,540
Yeah.

412
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,180
If it has something to do with me, I really care.

413
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,380
If it doesn't concern me,

414
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,660
then do whatever you want.

415
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,260
Yeah, all of us Capricorns are like this.

416
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,940
You're not a Capricorn.

417
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,540
Your birthday is April 8th.

418
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,420
Don't you care?

419
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,700
About what?

420
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,460
Winning or losing.

421
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,020
I do care, I care too.

422
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,340
Honestly, I don't really care about winning or losing.

423
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,380
Even if I'm the kind of person

424
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,540
who cares about having fun.

425
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,660
It's okay to make a wrong guess in a cool way.

426
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,300
It's fine to make a wrong guess as long as it's done confidently.

427
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,140
But I can't allow myself to make a mistake.

428
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,900
That's the kind of person I am.

429
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,420
Making a mistake.

430
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,460
I can make a wrong guess,

431
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,060
but I can't allow myself to do something wrong.

432
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,020
So after recording so many episodes,

433
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,980
have you ever gone back and reflected on a time when you thought

434
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,860
"How did Liu Yuning make a mistake?"

435
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,900
It was that episode when I sent a message in the group chat.

436
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,140
I felt like I didn't do well.

437
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,460
I went back and reflected on myself.

438
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,060
It's okay if I made the wrong choice,

439
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,380
but if I

440
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,740
subjectively influenced the people around me too much,

441
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,860
and you have a strong influence,

442
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,980
Right, and I think

443
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,020
I shouldn't have done that.

444
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,420
So I went back

445
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,820
and reflected for several days, actually.

446
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,260
Really, bro?

447
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,780
Really, I thought about it for several days.

448
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
So when I came back to record again,

449
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,940
I adjusted my mindset.

450
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,500
I could feel that you changed.

451
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,620
But I was the episode before that one.

452
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,660
No, you were after me.

453
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,900
Yeah.

454
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,660
After my episode, when I went home that night, you know,

455
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,380
I couldn't sleep at all.

456
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,500
Have you never once felt

457
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,940
that after recording and going back, you would have that

458
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
feeling of emotional waves inside?

459
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,660
The day after I finish recording,

460
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,100
I already forget what we recorded in the previous episode.

461
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,820
He only remembers how much fun we had together.

462
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,780
Then he asks me every day when we'll record again.

463
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,780
He just enjoys that brief happiness.

464
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,420
Once he gets it, that's enough for him.

465
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,180
Yeah, someone as carefree as him.

466
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,100
He's still young, you have to remember how old he is.

467
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,380
He's still young.

468
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,300
I'm almost thirty now.

469
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,460
He's the youngest.

470
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,180
Born in 1997.

471
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,380
What year were you born?

472
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,940
1992.

473
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,140
Think about when you were his age.

474
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,060
What kind of person were you?

475
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,940
I was much more persistent than him.

476
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,260
Really?

477
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,860
He's not persistent now, because he

478
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,580
Yeah, so he's just not a persistent person.

479
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,820
It's like you're a very content person.

480
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,500
He doesn't blame himself.

481
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,820
He really loves himself.

482
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,740
He's a healthy person.

483
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,940
That's so rare.

484
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,860
Yeah.

485
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,380
But he really likes to sing a certain song.

486
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,540
Which song?

487
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,700
"Often Blame Myself"

488
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,180
"Often Blame Myself"

489
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,740
That's my favorite song.

490
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,860
"Often Blame Myself"

491
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,420
I really envy his future partner.

492
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
They're all my other half.

493
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,500
Split into so many pieces.

494
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,540
So many pieces.

495
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,700
What about you? Have you ever gone back and reflected on yourself?

496
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,020
Does he even need to think about what to do when he goes back?

497
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,740
When I go back, I just...

498
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,460
When he goes back, he just feels great. He won.

499
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,580
Feels great.

500
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,460
I saw your livestream.

501
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,460
What livestream?

502
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
You know, that one...

503
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,580
Where you said you were 1.98 meters tall.

504
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Fine, I'm 1.98 meters, okay?

505
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,940
Objectively, I'm 1.95 meters.

506
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,060
Are you satisfied now that I said it?

507
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,180
You only livestream at music festivals, right?

508
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,260
No, it's just...

509
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,460
Just streaming when I'm bored and have nothing to do.

510
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,620
Livestreaming is really fun.

511
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,980
I'll come to your place and stream next time.

512
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,380
Don't you stream too? Don't you do it sometimes?

513
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,100
You go to his place.

514
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,500
Mine are all business streams.

515
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,340
You go livestream at Ning's place.

516
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,620
Let's go together.

517
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,900
Here's the thing.

518
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,660
If she has somewhere else

519
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,740
to let out her energy,

520
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,220
she would just do it there, right?

521
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,300
She takes on some business deals or something,

522
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,740
then she goes and does that.

523
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,100
The main thing is, I also want to livestream.

524
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,020
But I'm afraid I'll talk too fast.

525
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,460
You know?

526
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,620
And then,

527
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,220
In livestreaming, talking fast is probably the last thing to worry about.

528
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,780
No, it's like this—

529
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,460
I think you should find an opportunity to try it.

530
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,540
For example, when a new show comes out,

531
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,100
or your variety show is about to start,

532
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,500
just find a chance to do it.

533
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,540
Next year, I'll become the livestream queen, okay?

534
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,700
Sure.

535
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,860
Weibo will be so happy to hear that.

536
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,860
You two detectives

537
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,820
Say something

538
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,460
Say what?

539
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,220
We're voting now

540
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,900
Still here

541
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
Look, let me tell you

542
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,260
What kind of person is he?

543
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Let me analyze it for you

544
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,260
He cares a lot

545
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,900
He pretends not to care

546
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,060
Yes, I care a lot

547
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,620
After talking for so long

548
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,260
We're still struggling over who the culprit is

549
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,620
Still trying to lead everyone

550
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,500
Of course I care

551
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,660
How could I not care?

552
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,740
He seems like a cold person

553
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,860
But I think the way he cares

554
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,980
is about being immersed in the moment

555
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,220
When the show is over

556
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,700
If he gets it wrong, he says he can let it go

557
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,500
But actually, he can't

558
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,060
He really can't

559
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,100
No, I can't let it go

560
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
You know, sometimes

561
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,500
Sometimes after we finish work

562
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,660
He'll still talk to us in the group chat

563
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,900
That's when he can't let it go

564
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,820
Really, I can feel it

565
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
That's me at that moment

566
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,500
Often singing to myself in the room

567
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Often blaming myself

568
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,020
I really think that lately,

569
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,860
you've been finding it harder and harder to let go.

570
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,540
Because you've been talking more and more in the group.

571
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,740
That's right.

572
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,620
I think it's because of all of us.

573
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,060
We've warmed up his hollow heart.

574
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,340
We've filled up his heart.

575
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
At least filled part of it.

576
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,820
In certain moments, you all

577
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,700
make me feel like I actually have a heart.

578
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
I'm about to cry.

579
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,300
Seriously.

580
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
We should edit your words into

581
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,660
the title of this episode.

582
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,460
Let me tell you,

583
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,420
I really want to run over and hug him.

584
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,500
So that makes me a hollow person, huh?

585
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Okay.

586
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,220
No.

587
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,420
No, you’re just hollow in this aspect with us.

588
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,460
I never thought that between us

589
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,900
we could form a heart-to-heart connection.

590
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,540
In our dinner tonight, there was

591
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,420
a clue.

592
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,100
There was a dish Zhang Linghe won from a game.

593
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,140
Jiangxi stir-fry.

594
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,380
This one, right?

595
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,500
The second one.

596
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,620
It looks so good, Jiangxi stir-fry, stir-fry, stir-fry!

597
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,100
I was wondering why it tastes so good.

598
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,820
I have to at least try a bite.

599
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,100
This is really delicious.

600
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,180
Jiangxi’s specialty is

601
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,219
that it’s pretty spicy.

602
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:15,820
It’s like chili peppers stir-fried with more chili peppers.

603
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,660
Yeah.

604
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,300
I haven’t used this one.

605
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,580
Never used it.

606
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,660
Do you eat rice?

607
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,060
I don’t.

608
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:23,980
Pick out a piece of meat to eat.

609
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,939
There’s nothing left for me to pick.

610
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,980
It's a bit spicy.

611
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,860
I won a hawthorn roll.

612
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:33,939
I've already eaten it. It's really delicious.

613
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,340
You ordered from the convenience store, right?

614
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,699
Yeah.

615
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,740
None of you ordered.

616
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,300
This person is even sneakier.

617
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,460
He ordered a little stool for himself.

618
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,940
Useless.

619
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,060
Yeah, you might as well have ordered a few more dishes.

620
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,460
For us.

621
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,580
That one in your room, right?

622
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,820
Yeah.

623
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,700
Then you should have him hold it for you the whole time.

624
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,300
No.

625
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,580
Okay, I'll do that next time.

626
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,740
Because today we

627
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,100
went through some special segments.

628
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,980
So the production team prepared red envelopes.

629
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,420
Okay.

630
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Thank you.

631
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:03,940
Thank you.

632
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,300
Okay.

633
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,820
Thank you.

634
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,420
I want to see how much is inside.

635
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,060
It's so thick.

636
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,020
No, it's really a lot.

637
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,580
Really?

638
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,060
Seriously?

639
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,180
You really don't have to do this.

640
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,060
Is it really that much?

641
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Isn't this too much?

642
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,580
Are they not paying the final payment?

643
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,860
I only came to record after settling the final payment.

644
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,220
Really?

645
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,980
Then I'll go ask right away.

646
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Okay, let's take this out.

647
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,700
They're giving so much.

648
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,580
Usually, the crew only gives five or ten yuan.

649
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,980
Yeah, it's usually eight or ten yuan.

650
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
Bro, do you think it's too much?

651
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,860
If not, give me some.

652
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,220
Are you short even on this little?

653
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,100
You're short even on this? What's going on with you?

654
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,860
Yeah, that's how tough my life is.

655
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,340
Struggling.

656
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,100
Struggling.

657
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,260
What are you doing, are you in debt outside?

658
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,940
Yeah, can't you see me now?

659
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,820
I carry a weapon for self-defense all the time.

660
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm afraid someone will come after me.

661
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,100
So many.

662
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,620
Way too many.

663
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,140
So many.

664
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,740
Do we have to spend this all today?

665
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,140
Yes.

666
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,540
Spend it before going home.

667
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,580
How should we spend it?

668
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,900
Like, if you pass by a store on the way.

669
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
Just have him buy something.

670
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,740
I only found out in recent years too.

671
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,700
Yeah, only learned it while filming.

672
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,340
Yeah.

673
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,620
So, what stores do we have here?

674
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,300
Can I have someone else spend it for me later?

675
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,260
Sure.

676
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,180
This is the dessert you won.

677
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,060
Yeah.

678
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I won it, right.

679
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,660
This is what I won.

680
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
It looks so delicious.

681
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,860
The food in jail isn't bad.

682
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,940
Is this filled with meat?

683
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
It's just a plain steamed bun.

684
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,860
Plain.

685
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,260
Just eating a big steamed bun.

686
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,260
Big steamed buns are super tasty, try it.

687
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,980
Yeah, really.

688
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,180
If we finish this meal now,

689
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,020
they'll come back.

690
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,420
Right?

691
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,660
They'll lock us all together, right?

692
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,260
Yeah.

693
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
This way, there's a way.

694
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,460
We can lock ourselves in the cell.

695
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,220
They can't get in.

696
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,580
Would that scare you guys?

697
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,820
Would you think he...

698
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,380
Be careful, he might let you out.

699
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,900
We're so close right now.

700
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,140
Yeah.

701
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm totally charmed by you.

702
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,820
I'm definitely not voting for you today.

703
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,140
No, you have to vote for him.

704
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,300
Were you just sitting on these two buckets?

705
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,380
You sat on this.

706
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,340
Yeah.

707
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,260
Did you think I was just squatting the whole time?

708
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,660
I thought you brought a little stool.

709
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,340
Just right.

710
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,740
What's wrong?

711
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,780
Haven't I told you so many times already?

712
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,380
Still saying "I know."

713
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,020
And in the end?
