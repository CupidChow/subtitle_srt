1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,640
Come eat, quick.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,680
Come on, let's eat.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,120
Come on, time to eat.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,160
I really did go to his house for an acting class once.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,040
Seriously?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,720
If you start an acting class, I want to join too.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,360
They're talking about you being a "numbers actor."

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,200
I thought my character was already wild enough.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,240
I thought he was the male lead.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,920
The most complex one.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,680
And they're father and son.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,640
But in the end, I never expected I'd be the fourth male lead.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,240
Who would you choose to be X?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,560
Honestly, I would choose Bafentang.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,720
If you were the culprit,

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,640
who would you choose to be X?

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,560
I’d still choose Bafentang.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,040
Why?

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,400
Just that one time.

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,440
What about you? Who would you choose?

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,120
I’d definitely choose you.

23
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,640
Who do you choose?

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,560
I’m not telling you.

25
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,280
If I were X, I definitely wouldn’t help you.

26
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,040
Just because of what you said.

27
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
In a pure guessing state, who do you think it is?

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,480
I think it’s the security guard.

29
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,880
He’s been very quiet today.

30
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,240
Why aren’t you saying anything?

31
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
Do you know the method?

32
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
I’m hungry.

33
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,040
Have a few bites.

34
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Okay.

35
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,680
What are you laughing at?

36
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
I think she’s funny.

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Either you’re feeling guilty,

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
or you’ve fallen for her.

39
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,920
I already have.

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,000
Tell me the truth.

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,520
When I was put down there yesterday,

42
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,720
did you feel even a little sorry for me?

43
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Sorry for you?

44
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
We almost pulled you out.

45
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,200
We put you down there on purpose.

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,920
I don't know what happened.

47
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,840
Really.

48
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,960
We sent you off ourselves.

49
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,280
Do you know what I did last night?

50
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,480
You're going to break me.

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,600
I glued this myself, thank you.

52
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,120
Really.

53
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,280
You really glued it yourself?

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,840
No.

55
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,640
Look.

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,040
He's a "liar."

57
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
He's not a good person, he's really not a good guy.

58
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
He's very relaxed right now.

59
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
So he doesn't have an identity.

60
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,360
I have an identity.

61
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,240
Why did you think he was tense yesterday?

62
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
Yesterday I didn't need to guess his identity.

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,520
Because I knew he must be X.

64
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Because I'm not, I know I'm not.

65
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
To be honest,

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
I forgot there was an X part.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
I really forgot.

68
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,160
And then?

69
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,919
I thought X was optional.

70
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,560
It's not a must-have.

71
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,320
Then when I saw it,

72
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
I was completely unprepared.

73
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,400
For me,

74
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
It doesn't matter what state you come in.

75
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,360
But they need to observe you.

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
Right.

77
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,800
But at that time, I didn't notice.

78
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
I was recalling every word he said.

79
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
Too much nonsense.

80
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Okay, let me ask you something.

81
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,240
Starting from today,

82
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
Which of my words do you think...

83
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,160
Is it useful?

84
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
Because we haven't reached the stage of identifying the culprit yet.

85
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
I kept recalling yesterday.

86
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
We were deducing the culprit in that locked room.

87
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,120
You always thought

88
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
it was either Bafentang or Heniba.

89
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
You had a clear

90
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,240
Yes.

91
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
I know your line of thinking.

92
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,040
He didn't have any.

93
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,600
He was just constantly criticizing me.

94
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Right.

95
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,640
Just muddling through.

96
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
But honestly, I was also careless yesterday.

97
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Because I didn't

98
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
actually judge you as X.

99
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Because yesterday, at the last minute,

100
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you desperately defended him.

101
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He was basically safe.

102
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,480
But I still voted for him.

103
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
Because she acted well yesterday.

104
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Yesterday, she acted like

105
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,040
What's with that fog?

106
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,440
What does "going dark" mean?

107
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,240
How do you "go dark"?

108
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
Isn't this just like before?

109
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,640
Nothing's changed, right?

110
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
That fog, I think

111
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,880
do you know?

112
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I just couldn't bring myself to vote for her anymore.

113
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
No, wait a second.

114
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
Did you all figure it out?

115
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,200
Am I the only one who understands?

116
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,040
No, you know, once you get going

117
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,920
We really can't bear it.

118
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,400
I just feel that

119
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
I can't let you be in a bad mood for the first episode.

120
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
Come on, let's do it.

121
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,560
Stop trying to save face.

122
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,520
You were clearly fooled by her.

123
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,080
Yes, I admit I was fooled by her.

124
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Because she...

125
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,960
That was really good.

126
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,280
When was this?

127
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
How come I never saw something this exciting?

128
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
That's exactly how it was, I'm telling you.

129
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,360
Just tell me, did I get it right or not? Just say it.

130
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,920
Not bad.

131
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,840
Really.

132
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
Yesterday, they did a follow-up interview.

133
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,520
They asked how I managed to fool everyone.

134
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
I said I relied on this trick.

135
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
That's how I fooled everyone.

136
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean? I got goosebumps.

137
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
What do you mean?

138
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,200
Have you memorized tomorrow's lines?

139
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,840
The notice just came out today.

140
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,160
A senior is giving you guidance.

141
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
Come on, act out a part for us.

142
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
Say tomorrow's lines.

143
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,000
Hurry up.

144
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Let's see how you portray this character.

145
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
How do you handle it?

146
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
Have you improved?

147
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Send over the script.

148
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
Let Bai help you rehearse.

149
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,920
He'll act with you.

150
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,600
Bai, teach me, please.

151
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Bai, give me some guidance.

152
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,360
Alright.

153
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,200
Bai will tell you.

154
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Tomorrow's scene needs to show three layers of meaning.

155
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,040
There should be at least four emotional shifts.

156
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,279
I really did take an acting class at his place once.

157
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Really?

158
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Yeah, really.

159
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
If you start an acting class, I want to join too.

160
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,840
I've really wanted to take classes lately.

161
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,680
He doesn't run any acting classes.

162
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
We just talk about acting.

163
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,200
No.

164
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Yeah, just talk about acting.

165
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,280
I just go to his place to see him.

166
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,400
Then he talks to me about scripts and acting and stuff.

167
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,840
As soon as I walk into his place, scripts are all over the floor.

168
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,440
Like, dictionaries, Xinhua Dictionary.

169
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,920
Scripts.

170
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,960
Not that much, that's a bit exaggerated.

171
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,880
Maybe it's part of the decor.

172
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah.

173
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,440
Soft furnishings.

174
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,480
Character setup, you know?

175
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
Character setup.

176
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,120
Maybe he set it up before I came.

177
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,760
That's right.

178
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
And he's filming that video log.

179
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,080
That's right.

180
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,600
Isn't that Jin Jing?

181
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Not like your place.

182
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,920
The boxes on your floor are all like gold bars and stuff.

183
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
So luxurious.

184
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,280
Diamonds, right?

185
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,880
And then?

186
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
How did he teach you?

187
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
He told me,

188
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
he was telling me about the drama he recently filmed.

189
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
It's a historical drama.

190
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,200
That is to say,

191
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,920
it's about the transition between the Tang and Song dynasties.

192
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,000
Right.

193
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
So how do you prepare for that?

194
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,800
By constantly reading historical materials.

195
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
No.

196
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,920
Of course not.

197
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
Are you involved in political intrigue in it?

198
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,880
Is it about politics?

199
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
I play a king.

200
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
A king.

201
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,840
Wuyue.

202
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Then why do you need to look up words in the dictionary?

203
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,240
Because there are many words that are

204
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,920
in classical Chinese.

205
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Our lines

206
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,760
His lines are entirely in classical Chinese.

207
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
It's especially difficult.

208
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
So how will the audience understand it?

209
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
It will seem difficult to understand.

210
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
But if you get the rhythm right when you speak,

211
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,760
it becomes relatively easier to understand.

212
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,600
It still depends on the rhythm.

213
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
Say something and let me listen.

214
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,480
Let me see if I can understand.

215
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

216
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,240
You're the one acting with numbers.

217
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
Aren't you the one acting with colors?

218
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay.

219
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,280
White actor.

220
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,400
Okay.

221
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,680
Eat.

222
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,040
Come eat, quickly.

223
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,440
Okay, coming.

224
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,680
Coming.

225
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Come on, let's eat.

226
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,200
Come, let's eat.

227
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
Turn this off, please.

228
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
You're so kind.

229
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
And it's best to serve one less bowl.

230
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Because I want to eat steamed buns.

231
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Okay.

232
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,520
Thank you.

233
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
What are these things?

234
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,720
This is fish. I just brought it over.

235
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,440
Alright.

236
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,160
Even though I've been in this livestream room the whole time,

237
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
I still prepared some food.

238
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,840
The golden spoon is really nice.

239
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,560
You prepared some ready-made dishes for us again.

240
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Yes, that's right.

241
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
You're pretty impressive.

242
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,920
Little brother even served the rice for us first.

243
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
Do you want a big steamed bun?

244
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
Does anyone want to share?

245
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
You can break it into several pieces.

246
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,840
Then everyone can share.

247
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,200
Alright.

248
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,920
If you can't finish it,

249
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
I can't finish it.

250
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,880
Big Plate Chicken.

251
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,600
Is this chicken or beef?

252
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,640
This should be chicken.

253
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,240
Who served the rice just now?

254
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Ke'an, take a look.

255
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
That's a soup bowl.

256
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,200
Sorry.

257
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,840
It's okay, no problem.

258
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Is this alright?

259
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Let me try this egg.

260
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,200
Is it as tasty as the one Ning makes?

261
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
It's definitely better than mine.

262
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,960
Not necessarily.

263
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,480
Yours is actually pretty good too.

264
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
Let me tell you, next time you make it,

265
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,680
when you cook tomato and egg stir-fry,

266
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
add something to it.

267
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,160
Add some light soy sauce.

268
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,240
Light soy sauce?

269
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,400
Yeah, soy sauce. Just soy sauce.

270
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
But yours has a bit of sweetness.

271
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,880
That's because Jin Jing told me

272
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
to add some ketchup.

273
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,600
Restaurants actually do add ketchup.

274
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,400
In the restaurant version,

275
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
they also add a little sugar.

276
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
No wonder.

277
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
You can add some light soy sauce.

278
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
That's actually the main thing.

279
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,480
It makes the flavor stronger.

280
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
The egg and sour flavors are more intense.

281
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,840
This bread is pretty strong.

282
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,160
This bread—are you from Xi'an?

283
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,760
No.

284
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,840
Where are you from?

285
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
The Tang Dynasty of the East.

286
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,080
What are you doing?

287
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Isn't the Tang Empire's capital Chang'an?

288
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
What tasty food do you have there?

289
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,320
Fish and marinated duck.

290
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Okay.

291
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you eat flatbread?

292
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,120
Give me half, please.

293
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Here you go, just right.

294
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
No one can finish this one, right?

295
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Yeah, one is a bit too big.

296
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
Who wants to eat steamed buns?

297
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
That's a huge steamed bun.

298
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,760
Give me some, break off a piece for me.

299
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,480
Can I have a bit more of the crust?

300
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,640
Sure.

301
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,520
Give me what you don't want to eat.

302
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
I also like the crust.

303
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
I really like the crust.

304
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Does Zhang Linghe have any steamed buns?

305
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,159
I have some.

306
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
What kind of meat is this?

307
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,800
Spiced duck.

308
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,480
Spiced duck.

309
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,800
Is this from Changsha?

310
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,360
Spicy

311
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Can't handle spicy food

312
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,640
Eat this.

313
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
This is really tasty.

314
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,920
What is this?

315
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know.

316
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
It probably goes well with rice.

317
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
This is duck tendon.

318
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Yes.

319
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Thank you.

320
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,720
It's called duck tendon, right?

321
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes.

322
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,040
It's delicious.

323
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,680
It smells good.

324
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Why is this piece so big?

325
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Pork tendon.

326
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,480
Sorry.

327
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,080
No.

328
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,560
This should be duck tendon or chicken tendon.

329
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,400
Pork tendon.

330
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
How could pork tendon be in such thin strands?

331
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Pig nose tendon.

332
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
Sorry, I said it wrong.

333
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,320
Pig nose tendon.

334
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
The one inside the nose.

335
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Pig nose tendon, right.

336
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
I said it wrong, and even mentioned duck tendon.

337
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,360
I mentioned eight things, including chicken tendon.

338
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,040
So what are we going to do next, investigate?

339
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
I don't know.

340
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
You guys are the investigators.

341
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
If you don't know, who does?

342
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Because my rhythm is completely thrown off.

343
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,960
There’s too much unknown information.

344
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,960
We should check your dorm room.

345
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
We haven’t checked his dorm room yet.

346
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,600
There’s really a lot of information today.

347
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,000
And this Tu Youfu,

348
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,040
how did he actually die?

349
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
I can't figure it out at all.

350
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,640
Was he trying to scare us?

351
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:19,800
No.

352
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,720
She was talking about the specific cause of death.

353
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Electrocuted.

354
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,480
Wasn't he electrocuted?

355
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,040
Wasn't he electrocuted?

356
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,400
He knew he was going to do this.

357
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,600
The killer knew.

358
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
He wanted to collect our voiceprints.

359
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
To activate that thing.

360
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Then he had to pass through a certain place.

361
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
To make his body wet.

362
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,760
No.

363
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,560
The killer must have thought

364
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
he was coming to kill him.

365
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
Because the killer is among us.

366
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
Right, we don't know what he was going to do.

367
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,120
Right.

368
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,400
Right.

369
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,880
He definitely knew someone was coming to kill us.

370
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
And he definitely had to touch that electricity.

371
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,080
Right.

372
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,280
So he must have tampered with the electricity.

373
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Did something to it.

374
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
First, there's electricity.

375
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
Second, you have to make him go through a

376
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
or get him wet somehow.

377
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
That's a condition.

378
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
Only then, by accident,

379
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,440
for example, if his hand touches an exposed wire,

380
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,360
it has to be set up in advance.

381
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,440
So how would he get wet?

382
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,480
Right, I don't know.

383
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Maybe he went through somewhere,

384
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
or maybe it was raining when he came.

385
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,560
Or,

386
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,600
unless while he was doing it,

387
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,880
someone splashed water on him.

388
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
He has to walk past that pool.

389
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,040
That's possible too.

390
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
In that group chat just now, they said

391
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
they want to get us

392
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,240
those thirty people in the group

393
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
want to force us into the livestream room.

394
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
So he couldn't have walked past that pool.

395
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
Right, he probably didn't go there.

396
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,160
So he must have gone through something

397
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,120
that made him completely soaked.

398
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
Why aren't you saying anything?

399
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,280
Do you know the method?

400
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm hungry.

401
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,720
I also think you're not talking.

402
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,840
Have a few bites.

403
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,600
And your story together

404
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,840
is so simple, it's almost suspicious.

405
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Can't help it.

406
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
There will probably be more later.

407
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
I think there should be more coming up.

408
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
Later, we should get to a

409
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
that, uh, electrical room.

410
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
And in his room too.

411
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,680
There will be some clues about them.

412
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,480
Now you think the two of us have the biggest motives.

413
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Let me tell you,

414
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,640
maybe soon,

415
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
those two will turn everything upside down.

416
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah.

417
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
They're about to shake things up.

418
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,280
Think about it, my character is so explosive as the male lead,

419
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
but maybe I won't last much longer.

420
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
I thought my character was already wild enough.

421
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,880
I thought he was the male lead.

422
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
The most complex one.

423
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,920
And there's a father-son thing.

424
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,880
But in the end, I never expected to be the fourth male lead.

425
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,160
Yeah, it's fine.

426
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,040
We're probably both tied for fourth male lead.

427
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
That's how it turned out.

428
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,480
Those two are both the female leads.

429
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
We're just supporting roles.

430
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,000
In terms of ranking, we're at the bottom.

431
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah.

432
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
No, we don't even make the list.

433
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,560
This is an ensemble of male characters.

434
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
You two, let's see who can win the female lead.

435
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,640
Whoever is X is the female lead.

436
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm telling you,

437
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
Who do you think it is in the pure pursed-lips state right now?

438
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,960
In the pure pursed-lips state, I think it's the security guard.

439
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,960
I think it kind of looks like him too.

440
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,880
He's been very quiet today.

441
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
Because usually you two are always arguing.

442
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
But he was actually a bit off yesterday too.

443
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,560
Probably yesterday,

444
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,880
I understand being off.

445
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,800
It's because we haven't recorded the show in a long time.

446
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
Yesterday was the first day, so...

447
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
I think he was totally normal yesterday.

448
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
That's just his usual style.

449
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
How am I not like my usual self today?

450
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
Today, I'm just not doing any reasoning.

451
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm kind of...

452
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm bleeding, you made me so mad I started bleeding.

453
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,320
It's just that there's no reasoning.

454
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,480
Maybe I was just about to bring up a topic.

455
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,200
But I didn't get to finish.

456
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,280
So what could it be?

457
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,520
He came out to play games.

458
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
To work as a security guard.

459
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
But maybe his family

460
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,480
is actually a very wealthy family.

461
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,760
So he could invest five million in me.

462
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,040
But in his character's clues,

463
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
he owes money to loan sharks.

464
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,720
Makes sense.

465
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,280
Right?

466
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,320
Your imaginations

467
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,160
are really used in all the wrong places.

468
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,160
That's a fair point.

469
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,160
You're a bit passive today.

470
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
If you don't become a

471
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,960
professional esports player,

472
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
you'll have to go home and inherit the family fortune.

473
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
That's absolutely true.

474
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,680
It doesn't matter if you say I'm not in the right state.

475
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,880
You can all say that I'm not in the right state.

476
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000
But when it comes to the final deduction,

477
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
you'll still have to look at the evidence.

478
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Right.

479
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,880
You can't identify the culprit based on their behavior alone.

480
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,320
Yesterday's evidence clearly pointed to Bafentang.

481
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,200
Alright?

482
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,280
She only suspected her after looking at the evidence.

483
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,960
That's not true.

484
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,200
Her key piece of evidence was the blood sugar.

485
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,880
No one noticed it.

486
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,160
If no one noticed it, how could you rely on the evidence?

487
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,960
I already said it.

488
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,000
All the overlapping clues point to Bafentang.

489
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,880
You all won't listen to me.

490
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
Yesterday, she was the only one using logical deduction.

491
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,120
The only one reasoning logically.

492
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm the one who told them not to listen to you.

493
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,120
Bad woman

494
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,880
Look at these foolish men

495
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,280
They still think it's themselves

496
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,920
Based on the evidence, it's impossible to pin it on one person

497
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,680
That's what I'm telling you

498
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
Of course, I have an advantage over you all

499
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
Because in the end, the final choice

500
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
is between the two of us

501
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
I know for sure it's not me

502
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
So I'm more

503
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
No, it must be between those two

504
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Because yesterday he was

505
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,880
He did something

506
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,760
He played the strongest suspect's counter role

507
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,160
Do you know that?

508
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
Others will try to direct you

509
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,360
I think it's you

510
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,680
I just suddenly noticed your logic

511
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,120
That logic only makes sense

512
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,960
But it can't be said to be correct

513
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
If you get caught up in it, you'll think that way

514
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Right

515
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
One clue about the Ba Fen candy is

516
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
knowing that this factory is fake

517
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,880
This is her strongest clue

518
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,000
No, I didn't know it was fake

519
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,680
You knew

520
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,880
I knew it was fake

521
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,680
Because you saw that candy

522
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,240
You saw that candy

523
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
But you didn't find it, did you?

524
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,280
So among the known clues

525
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
he knew it was fake

526
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,080
so he's the biggest suspect

527
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,440
He's really good at using this kind of thing.

528
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,760
Has anyone else noticed?

529
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,960
He's like that instigator type.

530
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,400
You know?

531
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
He's just like someone who spreads gossip.

532
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,000
Exactly the same.

533
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
Am I the only one who thinks

534
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,520
that he's secretly colluding with him?

535
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,800
And then everyone says

536
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,640
Yeah.

537
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
No, I spoke up for you.

538
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
I said if he were X,

539
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
he wouldn't play like this.

540
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,600
Who are you talking about?

541
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,160
He said I should have locked Ba Fen Tang at the end.

542
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,640
Let me emphasize it to you again.

543
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
I said I couldn't speak up.

544
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
Whenever I say something,

545
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,360
that Bai Hanzi

546
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,760
immediately says Ning and I

547
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
are secretly up to something.

548
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
When those two talk,

549
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
they keep looking at each other.

550
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,400
Can you two be a little more careful?

551
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,920
Can you two be a little more careful?

552
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,040
You're always making eyes at each other.

553
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,480
That's actually true.

554
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Every time I watch you,

555
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,800
no matter who you're talking to,

556
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,120
you always look at Ning.

557
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,160
Because he's the detective.

558
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,560
Aren't I?

559
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
He is in charge of the situation.

560
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
He is standing in front of the blackboard.

561
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
And you, you're sitting there.

562
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,320
It's always been like this.

563
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
Okay.

564
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,480
Then today, I'll take charge.

565
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,320
It's not your turn today.

566
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Yes.

567
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,520
I used a card today.

568
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,080
Which card?

569
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,560
The Golden Key Steal card.

570
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
But you have to win to steal, right?

571
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,520
No.

572
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
I just designate one of you.

573
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I suggest you steal mine.

574
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Because I will definitely win.

575
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
You've already designated, right?

576
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,120
Already designated.

577
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,000
Whose card are you stealing?

578
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
He probably won't say now.

579
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,200
How could I tell you?

580
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,520
No.

581
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,440
Then when do I use my character setting?

582
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,880
How about this, let Bai Yu have a character setting.

583
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Active at fourteen

584
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,840
Loves solving mysteries

585
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,440
A young person who likes to set the pace

586
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes

587
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
What can you do if you didn't manage it?

588
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,520
If I didn't do it, I just feel blank

589
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
Negligence at work

590
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
It's just that I'm really bad at my job

591
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,400
I already feel embarrassed

592
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,680
My work skills were poor to begin with

593
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
I even spit out my food while eating

594
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,880
Yeah

595
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
Absolutely no professional skills

596
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,000
You even teach others, and still don't have any?

597
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,880
He's making it up, I don't teach anyone

598
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,040
We're just having a discussion

599
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,960
What else does he teach you?

600
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,680
I want to listen too, I want to learn as well

601
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
If you want to learn, it's simple—pay up

602
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,119
How much?

603
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,119
Five hundred

604
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,920
Depends

605
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,280
He told me I need to work hard to earn money to pay him tuition

606
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah, depends on how you do today

607
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,040
Detective work

608
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
So you don't think Bai Hanzi is the one today?

609
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,880
Who says I'm not?

610
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,720
Who dares to say I'm not?

611
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,960
It's too early to draw any conclusions now.

612
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,760
I don't think he is.

613
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
What makes you think I'm not?

614
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
It's too soon, okay?

615
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,520
I think neither of us is.

616
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Just think you're not, that's enough.

617
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Don't include me in your thinking.

618
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
You think neither of us is?

619
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,320
Why are you so sure you're not?

620
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,200
If you know you're not, then you're not.

621
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,040
What do you mean by "I think I am"?

622
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,960
What I mean is,

623
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,320
I think neither of us is.

624
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
You just missed the word "both."

625
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,360
Okay.

626
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,880
Detective, I think you're very thorough.

627
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,720
That's pretty good.

628
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I'll choose you today.

629
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
Choose me as X, right?

630
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,080
Yes.

631
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
But Bai Huanzi was a bit suspicious yesterday.

632
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
This is something I've noticed from years of playing Werewolf.

633
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
You've played Werewolf for years, huh?

634
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,640
Yes, it's a habit.

635
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,320
It's just that

636
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,280
Only when he's the killer or X

637
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,040
does he say during the pretending phase,

638
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
"Yes, that's me."

639
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,560
Only werewolves play like that.

640
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,640
What about me?

641
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,280
Pretend.

642
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,120
You said that yesterday.

643
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,760
Then what about today? What about now?

644
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
You're not anymore.

645
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
But yesterday you were.

646
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
Why was I yesterday,

647
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,760
but not now?

648
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,040
Yesterday you were clearly that kind of wolf.

649
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,440
You took it but didn't know what to say.

650
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
If you want to lie, you have to stay relaxed to say it.

651
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Yeah, that's me.

652
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,360
A good person wouldn't say that.

653
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,320
I'm speechless.

654
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,080
This mindset has been summed up by many people.

655
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,240
But in the last season,

656
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,720
I also kept saying before that

657
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:46,960
no,

658
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,440
but that sense of relaxation is different.

659
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,720
Acting it out and actually experiencing it are truly different.

660
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,240
It's still a direction we all need to work towards.

661
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Honestly, it does sound a bit like

662
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,680
If you act like you're in pain,

663
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,480
and actually having a knife stab you,

664
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,360
the pause is really different.

665
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,600
Today, you're the murderer.

666
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm telling you, let's wait and see.

667
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
Let's see what happens by the end of today.

668
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,720
It's hard to say.

669
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,760
This kind of thing is hard to say.

670
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,000
No.

671
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,640
I notice you’re all being armchair critics now.

672
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,520
Yesterday, not a single person thought he was X.

673
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,920
Some even believed what he said.

674
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
And now today, you say it's him.

675
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
I think he's X.

676
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,720
Yesterday, only you thought so.

677
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,560
And only you suspected me.

678
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,680
No, no one suspected you.

679
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
But someone did think he was X.

680
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,280
We haven't chosen X yet, right?

681
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
It's already been chosen, hasn't it?

682
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
The killer must have already made their choice.

683
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
I think after we finish eating

684
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,560
we'll definitely confirm it after the meal.

685
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,760
Have you made your choice? Who did you pick?

686
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,560
I've picked several.

687
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
If Hannibal is the culprit,

688
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,960
he would choose the golden spoon.

689
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,520
Why?

690
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,600
Why?

691
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Why?

692
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,920
No.

693
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,120
Because you two are usually just normal.

694
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,440
It's natural for you to tease each other.

695
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,000
And then you two

696
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,080
can keep teasing each other naturally.

697
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,680
If you were the killer,

698
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,320
who would you choose?

699
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,680
Between the two of them, who would you pick to be X?

700
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,720
You mean those two?

701
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,600
Who would you choose to be X?

702
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Honestly, I would pick Bafentang.

703
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,080
Why?

704
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,640
When has she ever been X?

705
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,000
Just that one time.

706
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
I've only been X that one time.

707
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,800
You're really good at it.

708
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,120
Why?

709
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,200
You're good at acting.

710
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,920
You might act next time.

711
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,280
You'll just change your way of acting.

712
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,320
You mean our Jintangshao can't act?

713
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,080
She's the type with strong logic.

714
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,760
It just feels different.

715
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,080
It's like choosing between you two.

716
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
Like picking one out of the two.

717
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
You can't rely on your logical ability

718
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm good

719
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
to throw dirt on someone

720
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,400
Right

721
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
My personality makes it easy for people to throw dirt on me

722
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
No, but your logical thinking is very strong

723
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,640
It's also easy for you to be smeared

724
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
You are easily smeared

725
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,480
But you can break through it

726
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,640
You can find a way

727
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,600
Actually, it's hard to break through

728
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
As long as you give me a fixed impression

729
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,840
She can't break through

730
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,560
She might not be able to break through

731
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,400
But what she says

732
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,280
You might even think it makes sense

733
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,920
That's just to add to the show's effect

734
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,840
But deep down in your heart

735
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,880
For example, like me and Bai Yu

736
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Everyone thinks I look more like X

737
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Yes, and it's hard to throw dirt on Ba Fen Tang

738
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,120
There's just nothing you can say

739
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
Why

740
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,320
Because her behavior is just very normal

741
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
She doesn't know what you could say about her

742
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,040
Whether she's the culprit or a normal person

743
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,840
She looks the same

744
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,280
Yes

745
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,440
Whether she's X or not X

746
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,520
She can hide it better, right?

747
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,240
Because you're usually in an X state

748
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,640
So

749
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Right, just like you

750
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,000
It's easy to hide

751
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
That makes sense.

752
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,160
If you were the killer,

753
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,080
who would you choose to be X?

754
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,760
These two ladies.

755
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,120
These two girls?

756
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
If I were the killer,

757
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,520
actually, I would still choose

758
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
they're all different.

759
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
I just said it, right?

760
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,520
The two have different styles.

761
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,960
Just for today, just in this scenario,

762
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,800
who would you choose?

763
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,440
Today, you are the killer.

764
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Today, I am the killer.

765
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,840
I still choose Bafentang.

766
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,520
Her style

767
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,720
actually makes me feel a bit more comfortable.

768
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,000
With her style, I can't keep up with what she says.

769
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,520
I can't control it.

770
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,400
It's easy to leave flaws.

771
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,080
I want to ask something.

772
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
Now that you're bringing this up,

773
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,640
Now that you're asking this question,

774
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,840
what's your intention?

775
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,000
He's definitely just

776
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
making small talk.

777
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,280
Trying to make the show more interesting.

778
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,200
But it's definitely not

779
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,080
I also feel it's a bit

780
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,120
What about you? Who do you choose?

781
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,880
Who do you choose?

782
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,200
Which one of you is X?

783
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,840
I would definitely choose you.

784
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,640
Because I need someone who complements me.

785
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
Alright, I noticed you guys

786
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
Who would you choose?

787
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,720
In that case,

788
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,920
I'll take a wild guess that X is

789
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,560
her.

790
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,240
It's her.

791
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,840
Why?

792
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Because everyone is.

793
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,240
If they have to choose you,

794
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,760
he thinks that after choosing you,

795
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,360
it's safe.

796
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,200
He can hide.

797
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,440
Right.

798
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,680
I'll make a blind guess.

799
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,320
But it's not certain.

800
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,840
But I have to say it now.

801
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,760
Because maybe later on,

802
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
I won't be able to change it.

803
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,360
Right.

804
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,080
I can't change it anymore.

805
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,480
Yeah, that's right, can't change it.

806
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,160
You still haven't said who you choose.

807
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm not telling you.

808
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Wait, they all said it.

809
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,320
Why are you like this?

810
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,800
Why do they all have to say it

811
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,760
but I have to say it?

812
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,240
Right?

813
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,800
If I were X, I definitely wouldn't help you.

814
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,080
Just because of what you said.

815
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Isn't there a new way to play this time?

816
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,840
You don't have to choose X.

817
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,520
You can choose not to pick.

818
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,680
Of course you can skip it.

819
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,800
But I think

820
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,440
you can skip it.

821
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
But no one will actually skip.

822
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
First, you'll have one less vote.

823
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Right.

824
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
You might as well use that vote.

825
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,400
Yeah.

826
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,640
Some people even have two votes.

827
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,760
How could you not vote?

828
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,440
He already used his.

829
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,520
I've used mine.

830
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,680
You think I can use it every round?

831
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,320
Are we eating too much?

832
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
We did eat a lot. I had half a bun.

833
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,120
I had a bowl of rice.

834
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,320
I even had rice soaked in soup.

835
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
I finished that whole steamed bun just now.

836
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,600
I ate it all.

837
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,400
You really did eat a lot.

838
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
Do you want these purple sweet potatoes?

839
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,600
You finished them.

840
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,880
I thought I could finish them.

841
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
The one who gets a green nosebleed after eating is...

842
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
No, you have to finish it.

843
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Look at us.

844
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,640
Ate a bit too much.

845
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,560
I was actually a bit hungry.

846
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,760
Bread like this can make you feel bloated.

847
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,560
Why do you call this "mo"?

848
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,160
Isn't this a "mantou"?

849
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,200
Yeah, where I'm from, we call it "mantou".

850
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,320
We southerners all call it "mo".

851
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,800
What? I'm from the south too.

852
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
Aren't you from the northwest?

853
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,440
Xi'an paomo.

854
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
What, Shaanxi?

855
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,680
It's just how people in this region do it.

856
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
So this is called "mo", right?

857
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,280
Yeah, they call it "mo".

858
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,720
Really.

859
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,120
"Mo" is the same as "mantou".

860
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
That's what it means.

861
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,000
Usually, the flat ones are called "mo".

862
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,640
I think so.

863
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,040
They call "mantou" "mo" too.

864
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,000
They used to say "mo mo".

865
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,920
Isn't that this kind of "mo" too?

866
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,240
Over there, they call it "Nang".

867
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,040
That's a different thing.

868
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,320
No.

869
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,680
Nang is something else.

870
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah, I know.

871
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,280
It's that flat bread.

872
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,800
Mo is a bit more doughy than mantou.

873
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Mo, bing, mantou—

874
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,560
They're actually all pretty similar.

875
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,480
You can call them by any of those names.

876
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,240
Their mo is also a bit thicker.

877
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,320
No, they're exactly the same.

878
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,400
Mo is just mantou.

879
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Really?

880
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,720
Mantou is mo.

881
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Yeah.

882
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Yangrou Paomo is made with mantou?

883
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,400
No.

884
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,040
No.

885
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,640
Maybe it's made with shaobing.

886
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,520
Yangrou Paomo—

887
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,200
Dry mantou.

888
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,960
It's a general term.

889
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
All these things are generally called "mo".

890
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,640
Right, but if you want to be specific,

891
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
then it's mantou, nang, or some kind of bing.

892
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
But as a general term,

893
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,760
I think so, but I'm not sure.

894
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,800
But I think

895
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,840
So today,

896
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,080
I'll just call them all "staple foods".

897
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
That works too.

898
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
Staple foods include mantou, porridge, and congee.

899
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,960
That's fine too.

900
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Thank you.

901
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,360
I want to eat.

902
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,120
You have two hands, how many do you want?

903
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,840
One.

904
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,240
Right.

905
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,800
It's not because it's hard to digest.

906
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,560
It's because if there's water, it goes down more easily.

907
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:44,960
Thank you.

908
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,840
Yeah, just too lazy to chew.

909
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,440
Too lazy to chew.

910
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,560
Where did you get that candy?

911
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,400
Why do you care where I got it?

912
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,760
You're wrong.

913
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,320
You're really wrong.

914
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
Ke An thinks you're really wrong.

915
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,440
Why?

916
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,080
What are you laughing at?

917
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Say it so everyone can feel it too.

918
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Why are you laughing?

919
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
I think she's funny.

920
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,520
Just looking at you makes me want to laugh.

921
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,000
He thinks you're funny.

922
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,840
You're all laughing at me.

923
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Especially me.

924
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm the funniest one.

925
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Can't help it.

926
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
I just want to laugh when I see her.

927
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,080
He fell in love with me just like Jin Fan.

928
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,320
I think he's wrong.

929
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:28,880
Okay.

930
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm wrong.

931
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,680
Because we've been together for so long.

932
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,640
And you only just realized?

933
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,560
Either you're feeling guilty,

934
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,640
or you've fallen in love with her.

935
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
You choose.

936
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
I already...

937
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
My husband specifically asked me to wear this.

938
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,080
He knew you were going to be on this show.

939
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,720
That's right.

940
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
There will be four men.

941
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,120
To constantly remind yourself.

942
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,680
And us as well.

943
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Right?

944
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,560
And us.

945
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,440
So the reason for wearing it on this finger is—

946
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,480
It's too loose here.

947
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,880
I'm too thin, so it falls off, that's why I wear it here.

948
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,280
When he says you have a problem—

949
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,680
Don't change the subject.

950
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm not changing the subject.

951
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,520
I already admitted it just now.

952
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Fine, I have a problem.

953
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,360
I was wrong, okay?

954
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,920
What exactly was wrong?

955
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,880
What else do you want me to say?

956
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Given the situation now—

957
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,280
Go on, explain more.

958
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
What you just said was right.

959
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,400
It's that kind of thing—

960
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
You're the culprit, aren't you?

961
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,480
Only a werewolf would play like this.

962
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I was wrong, okay?

963
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,200
I was wrong, okay?

964
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
It's me, it's me, alright?

965
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,680
It's me, okay?

966
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
The more you say, the more mistakes you make.

967
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,480
Sometimes, I really—

968
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,320
Even if it's just a joke, I still—

969
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
can't bear to bully (Ke).

970
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,520
But he's really easy to bully.

971
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
Very easy to bully.

972
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,560
Yeah, that's what makes him so cute.

973
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Teachers, it's time to get some exercise.

974
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm stuffed, a bit too full.

975
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,840
Time to digest.

976
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,600
X, go get the card.
