1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,760
The real culprit is

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,800
Baizhihua

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,200
X is

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,320
Ke Wuwang

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,880
I am the real culprit in this case.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,640
In Tuihoulang's study,

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,040
after picking up Laonianbao's delivery box,

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,360
I became suspicious.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,160
I really wanted to find out whether Tuqianlang

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,440
was actually dead or not.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
So I started searching around.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
I discovered that on the other side of the door

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
there was a ventilation duct

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,880
that led into the inner room.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
There was no one in the room.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,880
To avoid alerting anyone,

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,160
I quickly looked around

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,360
and found two medical reports.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,040
I was shocked.

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,600
They were clearly father and son,

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,360
but the medical conclusions were almost identical.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,880
It turned out that Tuqianlang was not only alive,

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,640
but was also using his son Tuihoulang's identity

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
to announce his own death to the outside world,

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,560
and continued to live on as his son.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,360
How cunning and deceitful.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,640
I almost fell for his trick.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
I must take revenge with my own hands.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,360
So I put the reports back

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,640
and left the study with the delivery box.

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,160
Back in my own room,

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,560
I started thinking about what method to use.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,400
Kill him without anyone noticing

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
and get away with it perfectly.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,440
Just now,

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,680
I was in the Tuihoulang study

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,200
and saw some food.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,760
All the tableware had the Langhua logo.

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,640
I remembered that last time I came to the exhibition

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,360
I found in the cabinet of the lounge

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,400
a bottle

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,560
of "Huodejiu" with the Langhua logo on it.

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
So this Langhua

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,440
should be the exclusive mark for Tuihoulang's items.

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
The lounge is a public area.

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,360
If you could poison something he was going to drink,

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,200
you could probably kill him without anyone noticing.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
I remember "Huodejiu" is quite special.

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,600
It's a super-concentrated beauty and health tonic.

50
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,640
Once a day,

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,400
it needs to be taken at dinnertime.

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,560
The bottle even has mixing instructions.

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,840
First, put a health syrup cube into the cup.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,480
Then add 150 milliliters of the tonic.

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,240
No need to stir.

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Sip it slowly.

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,160
This syrup cube

58
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,840
takes almost an hour to start dissolving.

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
If you could put poison in the syrup,

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,560
then from the very first sip he takes,

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,000
until he drinks the poisoned syrup at the bottom

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
there will be a one-hour time gap

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,960
according to the time on the invitation

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
as long as we find a type

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
of poison that takes effect 12 hours later

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
and put it in the syrup

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,480
at his dinner time around 6 p.m.

68
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,440
he will drink it in front of all the guests

69
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,280
he will join us for activities

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,240
then around 7 p.m. the poison will take effect and he will die

71
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
everyone will use the time of poisoning

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
to deduce the time of death backwards

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
and think the poison was administered around 7 p.m.

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,800
but I will have left before that

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,760
this way, I can escape perfectly

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
I slipped out of the mansion

77
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,400
and went to the black market.

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,320
I quickly bought a poison

79
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
that would take twelve hours to take effect.

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,720
Then I returned to the mansion.

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,400
I went to the parlor as invited.

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,960
Everyone introduced themselves briefly and then dispersed.

83
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
I waited for the right moment.

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,520
I took the few remaining syrup candies from the box

85
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,600
and put them in a bag.

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
I tore off the label from one of them.

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I made a tiny tear in the seal.

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Then I injected the prepared poison inside.

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
I put it back in the box.

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,640
The medicine for Tui Houlang

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
was labeled to be taken with this syrup.

92
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,480
So he would definitely use it.

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,560
Tui Houlang showed up on time

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
and started introducing the event.

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
He dined with us.

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,880
As expected, he used the syrup-mixed medicine.

97
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,760
He sipped it in front of everyone.

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,560
I quietly threw the poison vial and syrup box

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
into the trash can.

100
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
After a while,

101
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,320
I saw Ning the host leave.

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
I left as well.

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
When I left,

104
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Ba Jiaoshan and Jin Shangbao,

105
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,240
He Chongchong and Ke Wuwang were still there.

106
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,760
I buried the other unopened syrup candies

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,480
in the corridor's potted plant.

108
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,160
Then I returned to my room.

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,400
All that was left was to wait for Tui Qianlang to die from the poison.

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,320
Blank paper drawing

111
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Please accept your X challenge for today.

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
The rules of the challenge are:

113
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Complete thirty juggles within thirty seconds.

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,320
Let me do it.

115
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,279
Ready, go.

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,320
That’s two, right?

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,120
That’s thirty.

118
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Congratulations, you’ve completed the challenge.

119
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
I’m speechless.

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
The X you chose is

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
I choose

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,160
Ke Wuwang

123
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,080
What’s the reason?

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,200
No particular reason.

125
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
I just want him to vote with me.

126
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Do you want to choose X?

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
As the culprit in this case,

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,440
I think this case is too risky, so I won’t choose X.

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
Why is that?

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,720
Because I just want to

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,760
watch the two detectives

132
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,520
tear into each other and compete

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,440
accuse and suspect each other

134
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,960
but in the end, no one is X.

135
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
When no one is X,

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,200
then everyone is X.

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
Everyone, follow me.

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,120
Okay.

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
Let’s go.

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Come on.

141
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,200
Come on.

142
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,040
Watch your step, it’s a bit slippery.

143
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Alright.

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Your "gun" is pretty advanced.

145
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,240
You have a revolver.

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,680
Let me tell you all,

147
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
today’s equipment contains clues.

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Whose equipment is better?

149
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
Who has the strongest motive?

150
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,360
That's right.

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
What about those who don't have a "gun"?

152
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
So you're pointing at me, then.

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
With both a "sword" and a "gun".

154
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Is that what you mean?

155
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,800
Okay.

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Let's accuse each other first.

157
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
I think your suspicion is very reasonable.

158
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,120
Yes.

159
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,520
It must be reasonable.

160
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
That's right.

161
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,600
But since you're suspecting me,

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,760
then I'll have to find a chance to

163
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,080
get rid of me too.

164
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,440
Right.

165
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,160
You still don't know my role today, do you?

166
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
Okay.

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Your role

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,080
doesn't matter.

169
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,200
My role is one you can't touch.

170
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,160
You can't touch.

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,320
Right, you two are, you know...

172
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
And you still want to target me?

173
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
He's the "victim".

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
The two of us today should

175
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,960
stand on the side of justice.

176
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,800
If someone is turned into X,

177
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,680
they should have enough self-sacrifice to step forward.

178
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
You're vouching for yourself.

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Bro, we haven't reached the part where we confirm X yet.

180
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,320
You think it's you?

181
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
No, I don't think it's me.

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
That's why I said that.

183
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
You're suspecting me.

184
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,280
So you're X.

185
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
No.

186
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
You can't use that logic.

187
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,920
We're not at that stage yet.

188
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
You have to wait until that person confirms X.

189
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,200
The culprit must have contacted you in advance.

190
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
You have paranoia.

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,440
What is this?

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
This isn't called paranoia.

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,480
This is called a keen sense of justice.

194
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
No.

195
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
The culprit definitely wouldn't pick me as X.

196
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Because I can't play the villain.

197
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,560
That's something all the guests on this show agree on.

198
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,240
Aren't I a guest on this show?

199
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Right, so you definitely...

200
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Everyone knows my personality.

201
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
It's hard for me to be the bad guy.

202
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,440
So the culprit might try a different approach.

203
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,200
No, that would be too risky for them.

204
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
What if I expose them?

205
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
So they would definitely pick you.

206
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,160
They're already trying to frame someone.

207
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
There's no one else here.

208
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
What would be the point of me framing you?

209
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
None of us have even gone in yet.

210
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,520
We're already starting to argue among ourselves.

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,640
There's no infighting.

212
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm just making a reasonable guess.

213
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,440
So if there's an X today,

214
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,920
the culprit might also choose not to pick X.

215
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
If that's the case...

216
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
They wouldn't skip picking X.

217
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,320
How confident would you have to be to not pick X?

218
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,920
Jin, I think, could do something like that.

219
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,960
That's possible too.

220
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,720
She might be deliberately making us argue.

221
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,800
We both saw what was written on our own cards.

222
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
We're not X.

223
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
So we must think the other is X.

224
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
But actually, that's not the case.

225
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,640
We can keep that possibility in mind.

226
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,280
I don't think that's very likely.

227
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
I think there's only one person

228
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
who could do something like this.

229
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
And that's Jin.

230
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Now we have to find X first.

231
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,560
Here comes the exciting part.

232
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,360
He Jiawei

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,640
He's not bad.

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,159
He's not bad.

235
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,800
Yeah, he's pretty steady.

236
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,800
Feels kind of reliable.

237
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
But it's hard to say.

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,320
He's filming so many shows now.

239
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
I'll be watching you.

240
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll be watching you.

241
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Put it here.

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,200
Are you X?

243
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
That's X, him.

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,640
You're acting a bit strange.

245
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
You're X.

246
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm X.

247
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
If you're not X, don't admit it.

248
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
That's right, it's me.

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
He probably is.

250
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,200
You're so nervous your hands are shaking in those gloves.

251
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,680
What's going on?

252
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,200
That's true.

253
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,800
Alright, I am.

254
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,400
They wouldn't pick two people, right?

255
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,680
Last time, didn't you have an extra vote?

256
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,520
He just has one extra vote.

257
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Double vote.

258
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,240
That's for voting.

259
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Last time, he was basically two Xs.

260
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,480
Actually, when you have a double vote,

261
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
use it in the round when you have a role.

262
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,360
Right.

263
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
The chance of winning is highest.

264
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
It can't be Ning, right?

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
But I definitely don't think it's Jin.

266
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Why is it Bai Yu again?

267
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
Let's come up with a secret code.

268
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,320
giegiegie

270
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,400
That works too.

271
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Alright.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
Getting old.

273
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,960
So he is

274
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,640
pushing out the old for the new.

275
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Your motives for murder

276
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,920
all make sense.

277
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,960
He didn't try to save the others on the boat.

278
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,280
He mainly wanted to save himself.

279
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
Then there's no need to solve the case.

280
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,960
This person deserved to die.

281
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,440
What?

282
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you already siding with the killer?

283
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,280
Who are you protecting?

284
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm not X.

285
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
Who are you suspecting? Tell me.

286
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,480
So basically,

287
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,640
he sacrifices so many people every time.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Is it possible

289
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,160
that there are two killers?

290
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,240
Two people both did this.

291
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,240
What do you mean?

292
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
One person put the poison

293
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,760
into the syrup.

294
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,800
Another poisoned his wine glass.

295
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,560
Is that possible?

296
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,440
If that's the case,

297
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,880
could it be three people?

298
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Why?

299
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,760
Because in the end,

300
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,880
he died in the water.

301
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
Isn't that unnecessary?

302
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Then why give it to him

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,560
and put it in that tank?

304
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,720
For example, if I were the killer,

305
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,560
and I wanted this person dead,

306
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,960
and I wanted him to drown,

307
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
then I wouldn't need

308
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000
to use poison at all.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,920
I would just need to knock him out,

310
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,600
and after six hours,

311
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,520
put him in there.

312
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,440
As usual, this afternoon,

313
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
when we fill the tank with water,

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
he would die there.

315
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
There's no need for me to poison him a day earlier

316
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,200
and give him poison here.

317
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,520
Because the way I want him to die

318
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,560
is by drowning.

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,840
So drowning and poisoning

320
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,800
are two different things.

321
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
So I think there are two killers.

322
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
One is the one who actually killed him,

323
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
and the other just didn't manage to kill him.

324
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Is that possible?

325
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
Yes.

326
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
I think drowning

327
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,040
is definitely more likely than poisoning.

328
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,680
What he said

329
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
I understand you now.

330
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,880
So it must be drowning.

331
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,560
In other words,

332
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,760
what he said makes some sense.

333
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Whoever poisoned him can come forward now.

334
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Then we can rule them out.

335
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
Just jump out now and it's over.

336
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,920
Jumping out can help us eliminate one possibility.

337
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Come out.

338
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,280
The murderer who just poisoned someone

339
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,920
is really smart.

340
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
Even under so much pressure from us,

341
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,640
he didn't reveal himself.

342
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,640
We wanted to trick the poisoner into exposing themselves.

343
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,160
Yeah, but we didn't manage to do it just now.

344
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
But it's not like we

345
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,400
were trying to act all mysterious.

346
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
Really?

347
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,160
Did you guys know just now

348
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
that the poisoner was actually the murderer?

349
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,920
Who would know that?

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,680
We didn't know.

351
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
Who could know?

352
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
We were just about to trick them out.

353
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,200
That was really unbeatable, seriously.

354
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,600
So steady, like a veteran.

355
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Who can be this steady, like an "old dog"?

356
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
So logically, right now,

357
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,280
she and I have already been ruled out.

358
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,000
Only those two are left.

359
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
Bro, why are you ruled out?

360
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm definitely ruled out.

361
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,520
I don't think you're definitely ruled out either.

362
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
We've already confirmed one thing.

363
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
That is, the murderer

364
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
must have seen what's inside the shredder

365
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
to commit this crime.

366
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,040
No, that's to rule out him using water to flood it.

367
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,440
I was the one who saw the contents of the shredder.

368
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,080
I knew he wanted to do that.

369
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,280
But your method was poisoning.

370
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,720
Poisoning doesn't require looking inside the shredder at all.

371
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
So the three of you are still suspects.

372
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
No one is definitely ruled out.

373
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,720
Makes sense.

374
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
The person who passed through the secret room

375
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,240
is the only one who can confirm whether the one who pushed the first and second victims

376
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
is the same person.

377
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,880
That's right.

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,920
That's right.

379
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,720
So among the motives of you four,

380
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,200
who wanted to kill the first victim?

381
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
I wanted to kill the first victim.

382
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,400
Did you know about the secret room?

383
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
I didn't know, I...

384
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
You two are still contradicting each other like this.

385
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,400
What he said is also

386
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,160
I saw it, but I have doubts.

387
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,880
But he said he never went in either.

388
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
I also didn't know he was the first victim.

389
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,360
So I didn't want to kill him either.

390
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,000
That's the same as what you said.

391
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,440
So we can only rely on

392
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,480
some other timeline clues to figure this out.

393
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,840
If we determine

394
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,960
that he was poisoned,

395
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,680
then the killer must have known

396
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,440
that I put the poison in this syrup,

397
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
and that he would definitely eat it.

398
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,600
It must be someone who already knew about this habit.

399
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,880
Actually, if we follow his logic,

400
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,360
then

401
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
it does seem more like Ning Jiedai.

402
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,640
Let's vote.

403
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,280
Vote.

404
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,960
In my mind,

405
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,480
because I definitely know she's not the one.

406
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,680
It's very simple for me.

407
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
I have a sense about those two as well.

408
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,960
If we deduce it this way,

409
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,560
I think it can only be Ba Jiaoshan.

410
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,840
Because Ba Jiaoshan works here,

411
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
she's more likely to know

412
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,000
his routine, like coming here to take his medicine and such.

413
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,920
It can only be you.

414
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,000
Because I know I'm not.

415
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
Who do you choose?

416
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
I need to go back and think about it.

417
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
Do you think it's wrong for me to suspect Ning?

418
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
I don't think it's wrong.

419
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,560
Because Ning could do something like this.

420
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
He could pull it off at the last moment.

421
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Completely turn things around for himself.

422
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,400
Don't listen to him.

423
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
He could be X.

424
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Sure, of course you could also assume I'm X.

425
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,800
And I could assume you're X too.

426
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,760
If you insist on ruling out Ning,

427
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,160
then I could also think it's him.

428
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,800
Right?

429
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,280
Ning Reception

430
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,040
Luckily, your votes were split up today.

431
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Today, my vote is for

432
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,240
the real culprit candidate:

433
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Ba Jiaoshan.

434
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,920
Today, my choice for the real culprit is

435
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,440
Ba Jiaoshan.

436
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,840
Bai Zhihua.

437
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,359
Ba Jiaoshan.

438
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,640
Ning Reception

439
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,480
Bai Zhihua.

440
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,680
Could it be you?

441
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
Are you the X?

442
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,119
What if I'm not the X?

443
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,960
Do you know why I think you're the X?

444
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,400
I feel strange today.

445
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
I always thought I was the culprit.

446
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,520
But I didn't choose X.

447
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,200
You seemed really nervous when you came out.

448
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,360
There's a high chance he's the X.

449
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Do you remember last season when we were both detectives?

450
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
That time when we had to pick the X?

451
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,480
I was the X that time.

452
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
You didn't act like this then.

453
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,600
But today, you kind of do.

454
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,880
After you finished and came back,

455
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,960
your state was off.

456
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,760
Really off.

457
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,320
After all, compared to these people,

458
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
you're a bit younger than these sly foxes.

459
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
You really did come back blushing today.

460
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,160
Really?

461
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,040
No.

462
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,280
Someone saw him struggling to put on the gloves.

463
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
He blushed a bit afterwards.

464
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
Alright, that's enough.

465
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,280
You kept tearing the chicken for us earlier.

466
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,040
Did you know that?

467
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,320
He was tearing the chicken, waiting for us to eat first.

468
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
But after he put on the gloves and came back,

469
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,960
he nervously started eating like crazy.

470
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,920
Because usually, he'd say, "You guys eat."

471
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,120
After putting on the gloves, he tore up all the chicken.

472
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,840
He tore it all into the bowl.

473
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,320
I think he was afraid we'd finish it all.

474
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,200
Because he was out for a while,

475
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
and when he came back, he saw a lot was gone.

476
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
Everyone today,

477
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
lock in your suspect.

478
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,120
Failed.

479
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,800
Did this X and that culprit win?

480
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,880
I somehow voted correctly today.

481
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
I became third place.

482
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,640
You owe me an apology.

483
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,160
I'll apologize to you.

484
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll apologize for a whole week.

485
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,920
I'll check in and apologize in your fan forum every day.

486
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
Mr. Liu Yuning

487
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,480
Today, I'm here to say sorry to you.

488
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,160
You're really bad.

489
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,960
Next episode, let's do better.

490
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,520
Let's cooperate well.

491
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's work together, okay?

492
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,560
I really want to make Bai Yu cry.

493
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,360
Wait, I want to ask something.

494
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,160
We've been talking about the poisoned person.

495
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
They really should have jumped.

496
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,560
Not jumping would be really foolish.

497
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,240
What were you thinking at that moment?

498
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,280
No way I could jump, even if you beat me.

499
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
He's the real culprit, how could he possibly jump?

500
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Are you sure you're the real culprit?

501
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,960
Yes, I'm sure I'm the culprit.

502
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,600
There's no way I'd jump.

503
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,080
Today's MVP

504
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,400
Of course, the vote goes to Detective He.

505
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
Thanks to Detective He for helping us out in a tough spot.

506
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,360
He cast a vote for us.

507
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,040
He was crucial.

508
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,400
He truly deserves it.

509
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
I think it should be our Teacher Bai Yu.

510
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Right.

511
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,760
As a very successful

512
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,200
culprit who escaped,

513
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
actually, it wasn't that special.

514
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,800
It was just a narrow win.

515
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,960
But I think that day, his

516
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
our teamwork

517
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,000
mainly depended on his performance.

518
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,920
was as steady as always.

519
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,080
The MVP of the third round

520
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,920
in my mind is

521
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,000
Baizhihua

522
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes, it's our Bai

523
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,560
He very cleverly

524
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,920
escaped our pursuit

525
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Some of the things he usually says

526
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
or his usual behavior

527
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,520
are really good at confusing us

528
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,760
so he truly deserves to be the MVP

529
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,120
I hope in the next episode

530
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
I won't be fooled by him again

531
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
and I can reveal to everyone

532
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,040
his true colors, yes

533
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,560
I think the overall best MVP is

534
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,560
me and Ning Jiedai

535
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,600
Why?

536
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,280
Because only the two of us picked the right culprit

537
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,760
I think it should be Ning

538
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
He worked so hard

539
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
He deserves to get an MVP

540
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,280
But I didn't trust him and even doubted him

541
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,600
Just because I voted wrong

542
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,120
that one vote for the good guys (and lost)

543
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
I think I'm the MVP of this case

544
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,400
It seems that since I started recording three episodes

545
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,080
this is the only time I guessed the culprit right

546
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,600
You could say it was half guess, half luck

547
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
A rare time I got the culprit

548
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,280
So I think it's a good start

549
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,880
And I want to encourage myself

550
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
by making myself

551
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,080
the MVP of this round

552
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,720
I hope I can keep it up in the next round
