1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,200
Then let me fight with you.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,760
I want to fight with you.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,600
Why are we fighting each other?

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,840
They're monsters, there's no reason needed.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,800
I don't believe you can get this male lead.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,320
Eat him.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
Came here by motorcycle today.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,600
Came by motorcycle.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
So beautiful.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,120
The first day you saw her, really...

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
No, I'm amazed by her every time.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,280
Baby, our love

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,840
is like a drop tower ride.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,200
After we go down, let's sing this.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,560
Okay.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,400
I've always wanted to ask.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,280
So it was a performance from "Diamond Lover".

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
You came up with it yourself too.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
When I saw it back then, I was stunned.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll land on my knees.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Be careful with your knees when landing.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,920
Knees on the ground.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,879
So scared.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
What's wrong?

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,160
It's nothing.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,800
What's he doing?

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,360
He can't help it, I've got him under control.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,640
I've got him under control.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,440
Did you vote correctly?

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
I voted correctly.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,600
When I was talking here at the time,

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,000
I was talking about those two.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,440
It's really annoying.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Come on.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,160
Come on.

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Come on.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,960
I want to have one of yours.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,720
No, you can't have any.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,280
No.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Why are you holding a grudge?

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
No, neither of you can have any.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
Why are you still like this?

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,919
Wasn't it you who tricked him before?

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,600
Is this how you treat your brother?

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,160
Thanks, bro.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Why is everyone eating candy?

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,200
His is chewing gum.

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,000
You really love sweets.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,280
Because when I first started talking to you,

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,320
I always thought it was you.

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
You said it wasn't you, and I believed you.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Then I immediately suspected him instead.

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,840
Why?

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
What was my logic?

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,160
There are just two teams.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,120
It's their two teams and the other two teams.

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,760
If there are two killers,

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,480
and one instigator,

60
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
then it must be them.

61
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,920
If it's not those two,

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,640
then it's you two.

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,960
Everyone, grab an umbrella. There are umbrellas next to you.

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Take an umbrella.

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
(I misheard) "clap the board."

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Clap the board.

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Clap the board. Clap the board.

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,040
Not "hold the umbrella."

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,560
Clap the board.

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
Hold up the umbrella, it's raining outside.

71
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
How many umbrellas?

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,240
How many umbrellas?

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Sorry.

74
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,840
Because I already clapped the board just now.

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
So, can we walk with that kind of

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,480
"Heirs" vibe?

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,080
Come on.

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
We'll walk in the back.

79
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,920
We'll walk behind.

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,360
The two girls walk together.

81
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,440
And those two are in front?

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,920
And then the last row walks together, right?

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,760
After going down the stairs, we'll stand and wait.

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
You go ahead, we'll follow.

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Okay.

86
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,280
And you have to look cool when raising the umbrella, right?

87
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,920
Right.

88
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,480
Like that stylish way of flipping your hand when raising the umbrella.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Your toy is here.

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Tigger.

91
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,560
This feeling.

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
Tigger.

93
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Alright, that's enough playing.

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,840
Come.

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,920
You all can be considered

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,840
officially part of the camp now.

97
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,320
Yes.

98
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,520
So,

99
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,480
we're going to do a series of

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,840
performances

101
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
and audition scenes.

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,960
So here,

104
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,200
he already took them out just now.

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,320
We've prepared some props for everyone.

106
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
You can use these props

107
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,160
to do an improvised monster performance.

108
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,440
Performance.

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,880
Audition.

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,760
Right.

111
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,760
Okay.

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,880
I want to see how the famous one is performed.

114
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,320
Improvise.

115
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,640
I understand.

116
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
Isn't this from Plants vs. Zombies?

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
Those ones from inside the game?

118
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Doesn't it have that one?

119
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,640
Yes.

120
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,080
And you're the buckethead.

121
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Then what is this one?

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
This is the one that walks forward reading a newspaper.

123
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Is there one like that?

124
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Yes, there is.

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
The one that can walk in water.

126
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
He's the jumping one.

127
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,480
I want to play a rampaging zombie.

128
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,880
You keep jumping forward.

129
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
There are several types in Plants vs. Zombies.

130
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,280
So what does mine do?

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,040
Yours is...

132
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
It's the zombie with a helmet.

133
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
When hit, your helmet falls off first.

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,960
Why do I look like a "fool"?

135
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,240
Yeah.

136
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Let's go one by one, okay?

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
Then you start first.

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,360
Okay, I'll go. Alright.

139
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,520
Now I'm playing a half-monster, half-human.

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,880
Still has some remnants.

141
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,040
This is what I liked to play with when I was human.

142
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
Tigger.

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,920
Alright, ready, go.

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
Very good.

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Very imaginative.

146
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,400
Let me give everyone a hint.

147
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,160
You can add a bit more.

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
A hundred ways for this monster to die.

149
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,400
Then the two monsters fight each other.

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,480
Then let me fight you.

151
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,960
I want to fight you.

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Why are we fighting each other?

153
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,040
We're monsters, do we even need a reason?

154
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
But aren't we on the same team?

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,640
We're supposed to kill that one.

156
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
Steve? No, not Steve.

157
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,200
It's that one.

158
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Steve.

159
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,320
That one.

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
You haven't played before, have you?

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
It's okay, no problem.

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Just grab a newspaper.

163
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
Pretend to be a zombie and walk forward.

164
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
This is a newspaper zombie.

165
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,600
Right.

166
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Come on.

167
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Let's fight each other.

168
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,680
Three, two, one, go!

169
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,480
I don't believe you can get the main character.

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Is this really fun? I just want to ask.

171
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
Are you an old zombie?

172
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,240
That's how it is in Plants vs. Zombies.

173
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,880
No, the director is like this.

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
I think this will be really awkward.

175
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,360
I think it's going to be embarrassing.

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Let's all be embarrassed together.

177
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,400
Or everyone can do it together.

178
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,200
Right.

179
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,080
Because there are exactly six lanes.

180
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
We just keep walking forward.

181
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,360
Right?

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,560
Okay.

183
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Is that okay?

184
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Okay.

185
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,400
Alright, get ready, start.

186
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,720
Not bad, keep it up.

187
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,920
You can interact with each other.

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Feel free to improvise.

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Eat him.

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,840
Stay in character.

191
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,640
As the "savior,"

192
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,480
I blended in with the zombie group.

193
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:50,960
Okay.

194
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Can't die.

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,480
Okay.

196
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,280
Cut.

197
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,040
Very good, give everyone some encouragement.

198
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,280
Really?

199
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,360
Give yourselves a round of applause.

200
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,880
Excellent.

201
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,320
Excellent.

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's sit down and talk.

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
Sit.

204
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Sit.

205
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
Are you coming over too?

206
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
Alright, I'll sit for a while too.

207
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,000
Why did that door just now

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
suddenly get kicked open?

209
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Was it supposed to be kicked?

210
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's go.

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,600
At that time,

212
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,520
we had already lost our humanity.

213
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,400
We were just

214
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,720
We were "zombies."

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,040
Yeah, we really were.

216
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,360
It's a bit hot.

217
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,720
Okay, don't.

218
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,320
I want it.

219
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,880
Why do you use a different mini fan every day?

220
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,760
No, I just couldn't find my old one.

221
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,520
I used it during the day and now I can't find it.

222
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
There'll be another game like this soon.

223
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Of course.

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
If you want to turn on that computer,

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
you definitely have to play something.

226
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
You definitely have to pay a price.

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
The two of us are on the floor.

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
We're working on that thing on the floor.

229
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,000
We probably have to press it at the same time.

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm getting old.

231
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,120
Let Ke Yu do it.

232
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Here's a chance for you to show off.

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,840
Because it'll probably be really fast.

234
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,560
All six of us will be flailing around.

235
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,360
I don't know.

236
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,120
All busy and chaotic.

237
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Delivering water

238
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,600
I’m not drinking it

239
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Let the group leader have a drink

240
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,000
One for the group leader

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,640
Group leader, have one

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Group leader, drink

243
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,560
There’s one more here

244
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,640
This one is so handsome

245
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
How did you see that? From where?

246
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
He didn’t even look up

247
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
Look at the outline

248
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,160
Look

249
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
Have you ever seen one

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
There’s a boy

251
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
When he covers his face like this, he looks really good

252
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,480
Very handsome

253
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,200
But when he takes it down

254
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
He took the photo himself

255
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,960
He said don’t trust handsome guys online

256
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,120
I was just about to say

257
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,680
This extra is also really handsome

258
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
Make him happy

259
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,800
Let’s take a poster photo of the two of us

260
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Sure, wait a moment

261
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,320
You can take off your clothes now

262
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,920
Clothes off, okay

263
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Do you know what you smell like

264
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
That kind of fragrant tomato

265
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,040
scent

266
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,280
That’s the name of the perfume

267
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Really?

268
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,720
And that cherry

269
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Lily of the valley

270
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay

271
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
Post it online, I want to buy trending

272
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
Golden Rule

273
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,840
Do we really have this name?

274
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,720
No, I just made it up

275
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,520
Come here, your outfit looks even more like a couple's outfit with mine.

276
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,480
Sorry, I have someone new now.

277
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Everyone, please make some room for us.

278
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,720
Stand here, you come stand here.

279
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,600
Like this.

280
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,080
Would you date someone taller than you?

281
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,480
No, I wouldn't.

282
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll put the mic on you first.

283
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,280
What?

284
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,960
The mic.

285
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
What's your ideal height?

286
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,920
Because before,

287
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,280
I've heard tall guys say

288
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
they actually don't like girls who are too short.

289
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,880
That's not true either.

290
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,440
For example,

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,680
Look, I'm 1.9 meters tall.

292
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
If I date a girl who's 1.7 meters,

293
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,240
isn't that just right?

294
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
How tall would our daughter be, you tell me.

295
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
What's wrong with that?

296
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
She'd probably be 1.8 meters.

297
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,040
I really want to see you wear this outfit.

298
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
And reenact that scene where you smashed the cabinet.

299
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,640
What cabinet smashing?

300
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,920
That doctor, Dr. He.

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,480
So perverted.

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
I saw a girl drinking a beverage.

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,960
Do you know how she described it?

304
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
Was the drink good?

305
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
She said it was like kissing Zhang Linghe.

306
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,400
Just as good.

307
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,440
Okay.

308
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,000
You seem like you used to be

309
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,880
the kind of boss in school who was really powerful.

310
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,440
You looked lazy, like you couldn't fight.

311
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,040
But with a wave of your hand, lots of people would fight for you.

312
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,760
Alright, look, that's my little brother.

313
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,920
He’s definitely your little brother.

314
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm his number one follower, right?

315
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,320
Enforcer.

316
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Have you ever read a novel

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,800
called "That Boy Something"?

318
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,240
So Handsome.

319
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,040
"That Boy is So Handsome."

320
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,280
I think I know it.

321
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Isn't that a Korean drama?

322
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes, but it was adapted from a novel.

323
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah, that's right.

324
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,600
What year were you born?

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
1990.

326
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,800
I thought Ning was younger than him.

327
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Isn't that right?

328
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
I really like you guys.

329
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
After the last time we recorded,

330
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,840
I felt like I was having withdrawal symptoms when I got home.

331
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,120
Right?

332
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,200
I really missed you all.

333
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,840
Seriously.

334
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
But after a month, I got over it.

335
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,440
I see.

336
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,560
You got over it pretty quickly.

337
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,360
But now we're picking it up again right away.

338
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah.

339
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
Picking it up right away.

340
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah, just recording a show with us

341
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,880
takes a month to get over that feeling.

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,200
Did Zhang Linghe not get over it?

343
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Because he keeps asking me when we're recording again.

344
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,280
"When are we recording again?"

345
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,160
This guy must be really into it.

346
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,200
He goes back and asks, "Which one of you..."

347
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,440
"Which one of you..."

348
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,640
No way.

349
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,480
His lips are so thick, he must be really sentimental.

350
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,080
So does having thin lips mean you're cold-hearted?

351
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Mine are the thickest among us.

352
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,800
Bai's are thick too.

353
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,920
Mine are thin.

354
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,520
His lips are thick too.

355
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,240
No, I'm a cold-hearted person.

356
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,880
He's way too cold-hearted.

357
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm a cold-hearted person.

358
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
He's really too cold-hearted.

359
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,280
Just look at our chat history.

360
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,400
You'll see how cold-hearted he is.

361
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,840
Every day on WeChat, there are like twenty people on the screen.

362
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,000
You're always the first one to message.

363
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
He just scrolls past to look at the ones below.

364
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,920
I said Ning and I were having a good time together.

365
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,160
Why do you have to butt in?

366
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,480
I said us two old guys were having a good time.

367
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
That's what he said.

368
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,320
I said you always hang out with Ning and not with me.

369
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
He said, "Us two old guys are playing."

370
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Why are you trying to join in?

371
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
Came here by motorcycle today.

372
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Came by motorcycle.

373
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
So beautiful.

374
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,640
The first day you saw her, really...

375
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
No, every time I'm amazed by her.

376
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,120
She's just so cool.

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,400
Alright, everyone.

378
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
And then, Mr. Zhang Linghe.

379
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,560
The two who are sitting.

380
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,640
And also Mr. Zhou Keyu.

381
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
You can move your legs a little forward.

382
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,880
No.

383
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
Move one foot forward, sit a little less on the chair.

384
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,040
Sit a little less.

385
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,640
Sit up straighter, right?

386
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,080
Okay.

387
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,160
And then, everyone.

388
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,240
And move a little forward.

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,000
Lean forward a bit, right?

390
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
So what is this flashlight for?

391
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,840
To shine on you.

392
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,680
It's for searching.

393
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,400
Yes, move back a little.

394
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
Like, if someone lost a ring, we can look for it.

395
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,800
Move a little to the side.

396
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
Come on.

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
Three, two, one.

398
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Alright.

399
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,640
Let's change locations.

400
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay, that's good.

401
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,520
Alright.

402
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,920
Thank you.

403
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,360
The person next to you

404
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
has taken my seat.

405
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,400
You can adjust it yourselves.

406
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,360
Okay.

407
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm going to cool off with the air conditioner too.

408
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,560
It must be really cold, right, brother?

409
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
It's so hot, I'm dying.

410
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,080
Isn't this set low enough?

411
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's already at seventeen, sixteen degrees.

412
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,520
How much lower do you want it?

413
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah, hand it to me.

414
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,480
It's too hot.

415
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,400
This is about right.

416
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay, give it to me.

417
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
This noise is going to get us so many complaints.

418
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,120
Yeah.

419
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
It's fine, use mine.

420
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,440
If you get hot, let me know.

421
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm carrying one.

422
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,760
Yeah, the noise is a bit loud.

423
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,160
Today.

424
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,360
It's nothing.

425
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,480
What's wrong?

426
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm innocent today.

427
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,360
What makes you say you're innocent?

428
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
It's okay, we can talk about it later.

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Want some?

430
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll have one.

431
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,120
That chewing gum, right?

432
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,560
No.

433
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,360
Milk.

434
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
Cool, give me one.

435
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,320
But that person still hasn't come back.

436
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Well, should we search for Prince Charming first?

437
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's wait for him then.

438
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,680
Milk candy.

439
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,640
Let's wait for him.

440
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
Colostrum milk candy.

441
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
Nice shot.

442
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,680
Why is there someone here?

443
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Seriously?

444
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, I saw him.

445
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,960
That's the camera teacher, he's filming us now.

446
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,680
It's fine.

447
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,400
It's okay.

448
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,560
If he dares to rush out now,

449
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
we'll just punch him.

450
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,400
Yeah, right.

451
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,960
You ran faster than anyone just now.

452
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,840
Just now, you—

453
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Are you blocking the door? Seriously...

454
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,960
This "zombie" can even open the door by itself.

455
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm speechless.

456
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
No, you can't block this door.

457
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,160
It doesn't even have a handle.

458
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,280
What do we do?

459
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,680
The door handle fell off.

460
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,960
It pushes inward.

461
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
There's no handle at all.

462
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,560
Let's take a break.

463
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,600
It's fine, you should—

464
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,200
How do we block this door?

465
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
If I do this, it just opens.

466
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
He closed it himself.

467
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,680
He closed it himself.

468
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,280
Don't block the door.

469
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Can you guys hurry up?

470
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
We're trying our best.

471
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,720
I got "killed" by a bite.

472
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,200
It's okay, your sacrifice helps the group.

473
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,000
Stop filming.

474
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,680
Let me tell you all,

475
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,240
even the "zombies" are tired.

476
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,319
Those two extras are exhausted.

477
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay.

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,359
Wait a second.

479
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,440
Don't bump into you.

480
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,920
Alright.

481
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
Subdue them, subdue them.

482
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,240
This one won't be subdued.

483
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
We're the same kind, the same kind.

484
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,960
We're the same kind, the same kind.

485
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,400
Bite them.

486
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,400
Okay, let's go bite them.

487
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,520
Let's go.

488
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,800
Let's go, let's go bite them.

489
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,720
Go.

490
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,240
Go, let's go in, let's go in.

491
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,560
Let's go back, back.

492
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,120
Let's go back.

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Take a break.

494
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,800
Is it scary?

495
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
Is that a fast drop or a slow one?

496
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,360
It's a slow drop, right?

497
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
It's definitely scary.

498
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,920
But it's definitely safe too.

499
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,320
That's just how it is.

500
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,360
Just go up, one, two, three.

501
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,200
Drop tower.

502
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
Baby, our love

503
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,520
is like a drop tower.

504
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Let's sing this together when we go down.

505
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,360
What?

506
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,720
We'll sing this after we go down.

507
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,080
Okay.

508
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,480
How do you sing it? Teach me.

509
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,400
Baby, our feelings

510
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,080
are like a drop tower.

511
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,400
Suddenly rising up, then suddenly falling down.

512
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
You bring me a kind of madness.

513
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,480
Is it slippery?

514
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,120
Why aren't you wearing it?

515
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
I am wearing it.

516
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,760
I'm wearing it.

517
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,120
I wore it underneath.

518
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes, teacher, move your foot over here.

519
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,480
Sixth floor.

520
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,440
This is my extreme sport for today.

521
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,760
Need to carry it.

522
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Teacher, let's protect our heads.

523
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,680
Then I'm not wearing a jacket.

524
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,840
Help me lift this.

525
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a bit heavy.

526
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,800
How come everyone...

527
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,960
Is this a fisheye lens?

528
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,920
Stay a bit farther from me.

529
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,160
Okay.

530
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Why am I the only one?

531
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,920
Here.

532
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,640
Here.

533
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,400
There's more.

534
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Put it on here.

535
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,040
Then two people go down at a time.

536
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,640
Put it on, right?

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,040
Yes.

538
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,880
Come on.

539
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
So today, the killer has a certain logic.

540
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,040
He's not the killer.

541
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,200
No.

542
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,680
It's possible that when you go down,

543
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,080
the killer will cut your rope.

544
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,440
No.

545
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,840
Are you taking this seriously?

546
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,840
Do you have a grudge against any of the actors?

547
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,720
Just say it directly.

548
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,520
Cutting the rope, that's pretty ruthless.

549
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,160
Why don't you say that in this building,

550
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,760
you actually planted a time bomb?

551
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
We're all going to die soon.

552
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
It looks like we're trying to escape.

553
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,680
It's really pouring.

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,960
Let's go inside.

555
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,800
Go inside, don't get soaked.

556
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,840
It's too stuffy inside.

557
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
I came up for some fresh air.

558
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,160
Yeah.

559
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,600
The button at the back also needs to be fastened to the front.

560
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Let me tell you all,

561
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,000
my head...

562
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,400
Why am I different from you all?

563
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Just move back a bit and stick your butt out.

564
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,000
I can't get in.

565
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,480
It's fine, it's just meant to give you this.

566
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,880
The tightness of mine is like this now.

567
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Is this okay?

568
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,400
Do you feel comfortable now?

569
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,920
It's alright.

570
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,240
It's alright.

571
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
It just squeezes my chin a bit, anyway.

572
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,080
It has to be tight.

573
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,960
If it's not tight, it'll fall off.

574
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
Do you want your life or your chin?

575
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,760
I don't even know what counts as uncomfortable.

576
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,400
Or what counts as comfortable.

577
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,080
Does it hurt?

578
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,560
Is there any pain?

579
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,920
It's too tight.

580
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,400
Very tight.

581
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,240
It doesn't hurt.

582
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,840
It doesn't hurt, right?

583
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,800
Come on.

584
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,280
Everyone, teachers.

585
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,040
Come on, let's do it.

586
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,680
Are they each holding their own umbrella or...

587
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Yes.

588
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,200
We still need umbrellas.

589
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,360
Baba, your umbrella.

590
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,840
It's fine, we don't need umbrellas.

591
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,440
No umbrella.

592
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,040
The two of us can share one.

593
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,840
No need.

594
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,600
No need.

595
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,920
Right.

596
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,720
There's this thing on top.

597
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
It's fine, come on.

598
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
Come on, Lao Bai.

599
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,160
Go ahead.

600
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,760
Let's go.

601
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Go.

602
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,240
Go.

603
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,880
You can do it.

604
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,200
Okay.

605
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,840
Will the two of them come down?

606
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll put on my hat.

607
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,920
I'll go up and check on them.

608
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
Don't worry, they didn't go up.

609
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,280
I know, I'll put on my hat first.

610
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,800
Hat.

611
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,120
Give me my hat.

612
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,040
A few minutes won't make a difference.

613
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,040
You're leaving soon, right?

614
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Yeah.

615
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,880
What time are you leaving?

616
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
You have to leave after you finish recording this part.

617
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,800
I think it's a little after seven.

618
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah, I'll leave after recording this.

619
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,560
I've always wanted to ask.

620
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,440
So it was the performance from "Diamond Lover."

621
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,800
You came up with it yourself too.

622
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,680
I was shocked when I saw it back then.

623
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Because you were going to be replaced.

624
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
They wouldn't let me act anymore.

625
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah, I saw that interview.

626
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,720
Yeah.

627
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,400
I was nervous every day.

628
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,480
You just went all out, right?

629
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah.

630
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,920
I thought, since I was going to be replaced anyway, then...

631
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,200
I might as well go crazy.

632
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Make her hold it tight, this is too loose.

633
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,480
It's fine, or you can do it.

634
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,400
Because of this.

635
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,120
The crew too.

636
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,720
The stunt guys were all men too.

637
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
The two of them have finished jumping.

638
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Liu Yuning has finished jumping.

639
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
No.

640
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,280
You are the first group.

641
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,160
The two of us are the first group.

642
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,920
We are the first group.

643
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,080
Got scared.

644
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,640
Maximum. Take a look and see what setting is suitable.

645
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,760
Okay, it's already set to maximum, right?

646
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Yes, everything is turned to the maximum.

647
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,080
Like this?

648
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,760
This

649
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,480
Is there

650
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,240
Is it tight

651
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,400
Is it uncomfortable

652
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,160
Not tight

653
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Not tight

654
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,320
It needs to be here

655
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,040
If it's not tight here

656
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll fall from above

657
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
It'll wobble up there, okay

658
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,920
Be careful with your knees when you land

659
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Landing, I go straight down on my knees

660
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,680
One jump, just like this

661
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,760
Then let go of the rope

662
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,880
Kneeling on the ground

663
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,360
Yeah, like this

664
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,920
Phoenix kneel

665
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,520
Very cool

666
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,240
Yeah

667
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,000
What's wrong, you two are scared, right

668
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,840
You'll know how scary it is once you get up here

669
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Scared

670
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,080
Anyone would be scared

671
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,480
And we need to see how to actually do it

672
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,720
I'll go up and take a look first

673
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,080
You guys decide the order yourselves

674
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Decide the order yourselves

675
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,160
Yourself

676
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
I already don't want to

677
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,400
Decide the order yourselves

678
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,200
Wait, I don't even dare to let go with my hands

679
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,560
Everyone's scared. I'm afraid of heights too.

680
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:23,920
But it's okay.

681
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,040
You're afraid of heights.

682
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
A little, but I'm gradually overcoming it.

683
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,920
You're afraid of heights, bro.

684
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,520
How about we just forget it?

685
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,200
No.

686
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,880
I want to stick with it.

687
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,960
Who isn't afraid of heights?

688
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Everyone is.

689
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,960
I really can't look.

690
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,240
I don't even dare to walk over.

691
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,360
Be careful with this, it can open.

692
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,000
So I just don't know.

693
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,320
We...

694
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,960
I don't know how we're supposed to get down.

695
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,000
You know, right?

696
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
If it's like bungee jumping or something...

697
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,360
You know how it goes down.

698
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,000
Right now, I don't know how we're getting down.

699
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,320
Just hang directly on this.

700
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,560
Then let go.

701
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,600
Follow this line.

702
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah.

703
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,080
That's pretty cool too.

704
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,120
She thinks it's pretty cool.

705
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
Let her and Zhang Linghe go first.

706
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Be careful with your knees when you land.

707
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll land on my knees.

708
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,720
Be careful with your knees when you land.

709
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,440
Knees on the ground.

710
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,240
No, no.

711
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm so scared.

712
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,960
See, you're the only one who doesn't know.

713
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
You don't know how to get down.

714
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,440
It's really scary.

715
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,920
Careful, this is a door.

716
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,520
Careful, don't shake.

717
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Don't move.

718
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm begging you.

719
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,640
Really scared.

720
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,840
Yeah.

721
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,720
Stand further in.

722
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,880
What?

723
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,920
Really scared.

724
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,720
Do you dare to go down?

725
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,760
Do you dare to go down?

726
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,360
You go first.

727
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Then I'll go.

728
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,520
How do we do this? Is anyone guiding us?

729
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,960
Let's have the safety officer check again.

730
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Everyone, decide who will be in the first group.

731
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,080
Then we'll go first.

732
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,560
No problem.

733
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,400
The two of us will go first.

734
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,360
It doesn't matter.

735
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Sooner or later, we all have to do it.

736
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,560
Everyone has to go down.

737
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
You're amazing. How did you overcome it?

738
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,000
Aren't you afraid of heights?

739
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,520
I am afraid of heights.

740
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,720
Let's go inside.

741
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,600
Come here.

742
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,440
Do we go from here?

743
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,320
No.

744
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,160
You'll get bounced out.

745
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,760
This is our safety device.

746
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,720
Safety cable.

747
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,000
But how do you use this? I don't know how.

748
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
Right.

749
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,400
It's okay.

750
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,920
Just wing it.

751
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
What do you mean, "just wing it"?

752
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,080
Are you talking about them?

753
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,920
Or do you mean you don't know how to operate it when going down?

754
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,000
I mean, we don't know how to do it right now.

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,720
We don't know how to release the rope and stuff right now.

756
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Yeah.

757
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,800
What if we don't know how to release the rope?

758
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,640
The safety officer will teach you how to do it.

759
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
You can stand a bit further in.

760
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Which way in?

761
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,040
You two stand in the middle.

762
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,560
Be careful, the wire might hit your head.

763
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,560
You stand in the middle.

764
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:41,840
Okay.

765
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,320
This won't work. I really can't do it.

766
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,960
No way.

767
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,040
This won't work. I really can't do it.

768
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,440
No.

769
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
Jumping straight down? I really can't.

770
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,600
Jump straight down?

771
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,920
Who said that? Was it the teacher?

772
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,080
Teacher, do we have to jump straight down?

773
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,280
No.

774
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,240
How could we possibly jump straight down?

775
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
That's bungee jumping.

776
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,040
Isn't there a basket or a seat?

777
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,200
A basket?

778
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,880
I'll get you a basket and lower you down.

779
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,560
I really can't do this.

780
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Wait a second.

781
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
Let Reba team up with someone else.

782
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I'm afraid she won't be able to go.

783
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,640
So who will go with me first?

784
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,040
Do you want to go with me?

785
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,840
No, wait.

786
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,080
I haven't looked yet. I won't look.

787
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,280
No, I'm not jumping.

788
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,880
You two be the second group.

789
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,440
Watch us first.

790
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,000
Right.

791
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Slide a bit.

792
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,600
No, have one of the boys from the third group come.

793
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,280
Yeah.

794
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,480
Let them take a look.

795
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Do you think Liu Yuning is brave?

796
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,560
But I'm afraid I'll waste her time.

797
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,120
Zhou Keyu.

798
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm not scared.

799
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,200
You were rambling just now.

800
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I want to—I'm not looking, I won't look.

801
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,120
I'm not looking, I won't look.

802
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,040
Hold the top with this hand.

803
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,520
Okay.

804
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Hold the bottom with this hand.

805
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
Impossible.

806
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,920
What do you call this rope release?

807
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,840
Are your feet completely off the ground?

808
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,360
Seriously?

809
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,560
I really can't do it.

810
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,640
I really can't.

811
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
I've got goosebumps.

812
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,440
Going up and down quickly, that fast speed.

813
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
It's all about using both hands.

814
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,920
The grip strength on the rope.

815
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
Relying on your own strength.

816
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,560
No way, my hands will give out.

817
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
It's okay, later on—

818
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,480
Later, this part will already be reduced.

819
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
By seventy percent of the force.

820
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,320
Right.

821
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,440
With this, there's already leverage.

822
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
Like what they have.

823
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,080
So there's pressure.

824
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,160
Is it when you're going down?

825
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,680
No.

826
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,360
Slowing down, it's already reduced speed twice.

827
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Does this match with this?

828
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
Yes.

829
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,240
When going down.

830
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
When going down, it's all about your speed.

831
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
The more you loosen your grip, the faster it goes down.

832
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
If you keep loosening your hand, it'll keep going down.

833
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,080
Right.

834
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,520
As long as you hold on, it might stop.

835
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,960
Yes.

836
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,400
Got it.

837
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Yes.

838
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,920
Alright, teachers.

839
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,280
Why don't you let the next two groups of boys see who dares to try?

840
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Yeah, let them go first.

841
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,760
It's fine, let them go first.

842
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
See who can jump together.

843
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,840
Then we'll see after both groups have jumped.

844
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,920
Maybe you'll feel a little better.

845
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
There's no way I can step out.

846
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,360
I can't do it.

847
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,560
I can't, I really can't.

848
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,360
You kind of remind me of what my manager told me before.

849
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,280
She used to dare to do anything with me.

850
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,720
She'd even go on roller coasters with me.

851
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,160
But after she had a baby,

852
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,040
she didn't dare do anything anymore.

853
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,160
She gets scared.

854
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,320
Yeah, that's a good excuse.

855
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,280
I have a baby now.

856
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,480
If you hadn't mentioned it, I would've forgotten I have a baby.

857
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,120
Yeah.

858
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,440
Yeah, I have a baby.

859
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm a mom now, I can't.

860
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,520
Come on.

861
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Be careful.

862
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
How about we stand here instead?

863
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,840
This swings outward.

864
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,000
This part is the scariest.

865
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah.

866
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
No, don't swing.

867
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,240
I think you should sit down and move out slowly.

868
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,120
Yeah, that's it.

869
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,200
That's how it should be done.

870
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,480
Then which way do we face?

871
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,680
Do we face the wall?

872
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Face forward.

873
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
This is the safety rope, right?

874
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,840
Yeah.

875
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,520
Okay.

876
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,920
No way, I can't do it.

877
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,960
I absolutely can't.

878
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
Zhang Linghe, can you do it for me one more time?

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
He'll do it for me.

880
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Swap the face on that.

881
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,840
Jin Jing suddenly looks like she's 1.9 meters tall.

882
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Then I'll go out first.

883
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,520
Girls, stand inside, not outside.

884
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,280
I want to see how they go down.

885
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,440
Okay, let's stand here and watch.

886
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
I can't do it, I absolutely won't play this.

887
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,080
Is it scary?

888
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Can we watch now?

889
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,320
Yes, we should be able to now.

890
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
This looks like that...

891
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,240
That...

892
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,040
Isn't there that...

893
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Those workers who clean the tall buildings.

894
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,680
It's like this too.

895
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,480
Is it scary?

896
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
It's scary.

897
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,960
Stop talking.

898
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,120
It's really scary.

899
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,680
No way.

900
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,280
Scary.

901
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,040
Be careful.

902
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,000
So slow.

903
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,560
Let me down.

904
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,960
Release.

905
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,920
It's done.

906
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,840
Is Lao Zhang scared?

907
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,400
They're here.

908
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Who came?

909
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
The two of them.

910
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,400
The two of them are here.

911
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
I heard Liu Yuning's voice.

912
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,160
No, I already feel like crying.

913
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,800
What should I do?

914
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,680
It's okay, no rush.

915
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,800
So how is it now?

916
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,160
Which one of us?

917
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,840
Here, I can try.

918
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,200
I can try.

919
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Let me try.

920
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
This way, come this way.

921
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm worried about that rope.

922
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,360
I think it's a bit difficult for them.

923
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,200
Just at the beginning.

924
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,440
Yeah.

925
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
It's okay, not too fast.

926
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah, the rope.

927
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,440
He wrapped it around many times.

928
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
He tied a couple more knots.

929
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,000
The instructor is definitely safe, right?

930
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,000
I think they still need at least

931
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,280
half an hour to take the next step.

932
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
How is it?

933
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,440
Is it scary?

934
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,320
It's really scary.

935
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,920
It's just this part, it's fine.

936
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,600
The scariest part is going out, right?

937
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,240
Yeah.

938
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,640
Yeah.

939
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,680
Are you scared?

940
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,760
I just thought it was like this.

941
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,080
Holding the rope like this.

942
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,120
Going down like this.

943
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
But if it's done slowly like this,

944
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,040
then it's not so bad.

945
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,600
It's okay, seems fine.

946
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,360
Why is it like Conan's?

947
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,680
And they just said they need to get to the building across.

948
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,360
I was wondering how they would swing across.

949
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,200
It's from here

950
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,160
to the building across.

951
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,320
They have a line.

952
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,600
Look, there's a line over there.

953
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,160
That's for flying that plane.

954
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,400
The view here is pretty nice.

955
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,760
You guys haven't gone down yet.

956
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,520
I wanted to wait for you to come up.

957
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,120
Come on.

958
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,440
What, you don't want to go down?

959
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
At least there's someone behind us.

960
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,440
Saying things like "don't be afraid."

961
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:06,640
You guys.

962
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,120
What?

963
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,440
At least someone up there is saying

964
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,760
Why, did putting on the helmet seal you off or something?

965
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
I can't hear anything with it on.

966
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Careful, there's a rope above.

967
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,640
There's a rope over there.

968
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,280
Do your hands get tired?

969
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,120
This hand holds on, and this hand loosens the rope.

970
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,520
You loosen the rope little by little, controlling it yourself.

971
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,880
We're both about to fall asleep.

972
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,800
No, not yet.

973
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,120
I said we're both about to fall asleep.

974
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
Then you should take a nap.

975
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,880
It was the same when I went bungee jumping.

976
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,120
Because I had to go to France.

977
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,280
So I just jumped.

978
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I hurried and jumped.

979
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
After jumping, I rushed to the next job.

980
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,160
Did you find bungee jumping scary?

981
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,280
It's that moment when you go down.

982
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,120
Actually, as soon as you swing over,

983
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,760
you'll feel

984
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,720
like your heart drops

985
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,000
not sure if it jumps to your throat

986
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
or drops to your stomach.

987
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,760
It just drops for a moment.

988
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,080
Then it comes back up.

989
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,600
You only feel uncomfortable for that moment.

990
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,560
And it's not like this.

991
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,080
Here, you can steady yourself.

992
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,000
And move slowly.

993
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,440
But with that, you just whoosh and slide down.

994
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,160
At that moment,

995
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
you just choke up for a second.

996
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,159
Then it's fine.

997
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,960
And then you feel so relieved.

998
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,239
It's just like our lives.

999
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,960
Yes.

1000
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
It's that moment when you take the first step.

1001
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,480
It's actually really scary.

1002
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,120
Yes.

1003
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,880
But once you take that step, you'll realize

1004
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,159
it's not that frightening after all.

1005
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
I noticed Liu Yuning disappeared.

1006
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,679
He said, "Okay, I'll do it."

1007
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,880
And then he was gone.

1008
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,520
Liu Yuning is getting dressed.

1009
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,400
He's putting on the safety suit in the storage room.

1010
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,400
I'll catch you.

1011
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,280
Don't, don't.

1012
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,639
Have you ever bungee jumped?

1013
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,120
No.

1014
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,600
Have you ridden a roller coaster?

1015
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,280
I've ridden a roller coaster.

1016
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,280
This is just like when you guys use wire harnesses.

1017
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
Actually, it's not the same.

1018
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,000
I think it's different.

1019
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,240
No.

1020
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,640
Because with wire harnesses,

1021
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,040
no matter what, it still moves a bit.

1022
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,400
But with this, you're just there.

1023
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,360
It's the same as that.

1024
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,960
You release it yourself.

1025
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,480
How do you release it?

1026
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,200
Hold with this hand, release with this hand.

1027
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,880
Like this.

1028
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,040
We use the kind of crane for chandeliers in Hengdian.

1029
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,920
It must be about seventy meters.

1030
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Around fifty meters is about right.

1031
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,160
That's the maximum.

1032
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,600
Fifty meters, I think that's the absolute limit.

1033
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,040
That's about right.

1034
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,680
If they don't come down soon, I'm going to transform.

1035
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,600
Go, Jin Jing!

1036
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,480
I'm actually a little scared.

1037
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,120
It's okay.

1038
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
I was just thinking of letting Reba go first.

1039
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,000
It's fine because it's not fast.

1040
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,080
So it's okay.

1041
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,720
You won't feel that sense of weightlessness.

1042
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll take her down.

1043
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Okay, then tie the rope first.

1044
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,120
Give it to the instructor, call the instructor.

1045
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,640
Where are you?

1046
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,120
You're here.

1047
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm here, right?

1048
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Don't worry, it's very stable.

1049
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,880
Don't worry, it shakes a lot the whole time.

1050
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Jin Jing.

1051
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,160
Don't think about it.

1052
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,200
There are two ropes.

1053
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,120
It has two ropes.

1054
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
One rope is for your safety.

1055
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,480
The other one you control yourself.

1056
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,720
So even if you lose control,

1057
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,280
it will still hold you.

1058
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,760
Do you understand?

1059
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,880
Forget it if you don't have this, bro.

1060
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,040
Don't look down.

1061
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,520
Later, this hand will grab here.

1062
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Grab it like this.

1063
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,080
Like this, just reverse it.

1064
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,600
Grab it like this.

1065
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,560
Yes, and then try to...

1066
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm afraid I can't hold on.

1067
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,920
This hand of mine can't really do it.

1068
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,160
Let go of this pole.

1069
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,680
When you go down later, this ring

1070
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
will take off about sixty percent of the force.

1071
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,880
This one will also take off about twenty percent.

1072
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,320
So there will be almost no force left.

1073
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,600
So there will be almost no force left.

1074
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,240
This wire is safe now, right?

1075
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,800
It's safe.

1076
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,040
There's another section of rope at the back.

1077
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,640
As long as the wire is safe, it's fine.

1078
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,440
Whether this hand lets go or not doesn't matter anymore.

1079
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,280
You can do it!

1080
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,040
I still have a bit of humanity left in me.

1081
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,520
Monster.

1082
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,120
What are you talking about?

1083
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,080
Who's shouting down there?

1084
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
Who's been chattering down there the whole time?

1085
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
Be quiet.

1086
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,400
Come on!

1087
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
You got this!

1088
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,440
It's okay.

1089
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,880
You can do it.

1090
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,280
It's fine.

1091
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,960
But with this step,

1092
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
you just can't get out.

1093
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Can you lift her up first?

1094
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, tighten it up first.

1095
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,040
Tighten it up first.

1096
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,960
You can squat down first, squat down.

1097
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Squat down first.

1098
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,400
Squat down slowly.

1099
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,720
Go down slowly.

1100
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm not letting you out right now.

1101
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,840
Not letting you out.

1102
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,680
Is that Jin Jing on the left?

1103
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm nearsighted.

1104
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,880
I can't see clearly either.

1105
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,400
I'm guessing.

1106
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,480
I can't see at all.

1107
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,520
The one standing there is the safety officer.

1108
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,040
The one in green on the left inside is Jin Jing.

1109
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,760
The one on the right is Ba.

1110
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm about to cry.

1111
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,840
How about this,

1112
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,640
How about this, Jin Jing,

1113
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,320
why don't you take a bit more time to prepare yourself mentally?

1114
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,480
Let the other two go first.

1115
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Take your time.

1116
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,640
Is that okay?

1117
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,520
Is that alright?

1118
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
That's fine, let's let someone else go first.

1119
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,760
If you jump, I'll jump.

1120
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,480
I'll go.

1121
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,480
Alright, now I'm scared.

1122
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,680
It's okay.

1123
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm just worried you might miss your flight.

1124
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,400
No, it's fine.

1125
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,560
That doesn't really matter.

1126
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,640
Watching others play looks pretty fun.

1127
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,120
Hey, have you ever seen

1128
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,400
someone walking on that

1129
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,160
cableway on the mountain?

1130
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,280
He finished walking the line but didn't hook on.

1131
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,720
Have you seen that?

1132
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,280
Alright, so how do we get out?

1133
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,840
In a bit.

1134
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,160
Just take one step and you're out.

1135
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,600
Right.

1136
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,040
Okay.

1137
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,400
Wait a second.

1138
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,200
Is the rope caught on something?

1139
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,000
This one? No, it's not.

1140
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,560
It won't.

1141
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,400
Once he's out, it'll be fine.

1142
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,320
Yeah, just don't let it get caught on that corner.

1143
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,880
Both girls have come down.

1144
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:51,840
Here they come.

1145
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
You can do it!

1146
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,320
Is that a guy or a girl?

1147
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,560
I can't tell.

1148
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,080
Go for it!

1149
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,600
I can see you shaking.

1150
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,600
Look at Liu Yuning's left hand shaking.

1151
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,200
It's okay, Jin Jing.

1152
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,560
It's like sitting.

1153
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,600
Just don't look down and you'll be fine.

1154
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:12,840
Alright.

1155
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,400
Jin Jing, it's still okay.

1156
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,160
It's not scary, right?

1157
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
It's not scary, you're sitting.

1158
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeah, just don't look down.

1159
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
Don't look down.

1160
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,040
Just lower the rope slowly.

1161
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,120
Even looking down is okay.

1162
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
Liu Yuning is so funny.

1163
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,040
His left hand...

1164
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,320
It's fine, Jin Jing.

1165
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,960
Just go down for a bit and it'll be fine.

1166
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,040
Reba is fine, Jin Jing.

1167
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,120
It's really fine.

1168
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Really, it's fine.

1169
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,200
Just don't look down.

1170
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,840
Take it slow, no need to rush, Ba.

1171
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
My hands are a bit tired.

1172
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,360
More than halfway there.

1173
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,640
Yeah.

1174
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,360
Okay.

1175
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,560
There's one more level.

1176
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:04,840
Okay.

1177
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,640
It's fine, no rush.

1178
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,160
No need to compete.

1179
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,920
No one's competing.

1180
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm just lighter than you.

1181
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,000
It's that the rope will...

1182
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
It'll take less effort, right?

1183
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,880
Yeah.

1184
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,160
Come on.

1185
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,120
Okay, let's go.

1186
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,320
Let's go.

1187
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,200
Come over here.

1188
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,960
Go, just go straight.

1189
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,040
Which side do you want to be on later?

1190
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,080
I'll be on this side.

1191
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,320
It's okay, I'll be by your side to cheer you up.

1192
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,440
It's all right.

1193
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,040
Turn around and look at me in a bit.

1194
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,120
Because you're really scared.

1195
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,280
So you want a little comfort.

1196
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,400
Look over at me.

1197
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,520
You say it's fine.

1198
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,080
Yeah.

1199
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,280
It's okay, sis.

1200
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,920
It's fine.

1201
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Then let go with your hand.

1202
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,360
Right.

1203
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,360
I feel like I can only do it if I'm teamed up with Reba.

1204
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,240
That's the only way I can go down.

1205
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
Then why did you let her go?

1206
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,320
Later, I was afraid I'd take up too much of her time.

1207
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,200
She had to catch a flight.

1208
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,760
But it's exactly because she had to catch a flight

1209
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,800
that I was able to go down.

1210
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,600
It's about to start.

1211
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,320
If you yourself

1212
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,720
If you're really scared

1213
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,600
or can't control your hands,

1214
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,000
the harness behind you will hold you up.

1215
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,200
Then you'll go down slowly.

1216
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,640
It's very steady and safe.

1217
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,160
Can I go out with my eyes closed?

1218
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,960
That's no problem.

1219
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,920
But you have to get used to it.

1220
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,280
We need to open our eyes.

1221
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,640
Safety is absolutely guaranteed.

1222
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,720
You don't need to be afraid.

1223
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,240
This hand of yours—

1224
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,800
As long as this hand holds onto this,

1225
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,880
as long as you don't let go, it won't slip.

1226
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,200
Sis, how about you watch me?

1227
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,240
The two of us can go down like this.

1228
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,480
Don't look ahead, and don't look down.

1229
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Let's just go out like this.

1230
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,680
How about it?

1231
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,400
Sit down first.

1232
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,520
Try sitting in this position.

1233
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,240
Yes, just like that.

1234
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
Actually, it feels pretty comfortable, doesn't it?

1235
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:04,760
Right?

1236
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,160
It can also, for example—

1237
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,000
Because at first,

1238
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
you need to control the rope yourself to go down.

1239
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,040
If you can do it now,

1240
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,560
then you just sit out,

1241
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,880
and it will slowly lower you down by itself.

1242
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,720
You don't have to do anything.

1243
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Let me try again.

1244
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,520
Go ahead and try.

1245
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,000
Sit down first.

1246
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,520
Okay.

1247
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,480
Yes.

1248
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,560
Yes, sit down further.

1249
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,120
Yes, sit.

1250
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,480
I'm afraid my right hand can't hold on.

1251
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,800
Lift that leg up.

1252
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,400
Lift it up slowly.

1253
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,440
You lift it slowly first.

1254
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,040
Feel it for yourself.

1255
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,360
Slowly lift, lift.

1256
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,880
Isn't that right?

1257
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,720
It feels different now.

1258
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:38,960
Yes.

1259
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,720
Yes.

1260
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,800
That's the idea.

1261
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,040
How about I go first and you watch me?

1262
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,240
I don't want you to be outside

1263
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,360
hanging there waiting for me.

1264
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,360
You must be really scared then.

1265
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,760
Then let's go out together.

1266
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,120
Just like how you felt earlier.

1267
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,160
Lift your foot up.

1268
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,880
I'll go slowly, bit by bit.

1269
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,120
If you feel uncomfortable, I'll pull you back.

1270
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,400
Okay?

1271
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,920
Okay.

1272
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,600
Let it out.

1273
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,640
The teacher will pull you back too.

1274
00:42:59,640 --> 00:42:59,960
Don't worry.

1275
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,320
Right.

1276
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,680
Okay.

1277
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:00,920
Okay.

1278
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
This rope.

1279
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on.

1280
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,160
Lift your foot.

1281
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,640
Lift your foot.

1282
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm afraid to lift my foot.

1283
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,840
It's okay, don't worry.

1284
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,200
I'll hold you, you lift.

1285
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,680
I lifted it.

1286
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,760
You can do it.

1287
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,480
Right.

1288
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,920
Actually, it's just this feeling.

1289
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,240
In a moment, it'll feel just like this.

1290
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,480
But doesn't it feel okay?

1291
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,040
How do you feel?

1292
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,920
Right.

1293
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,800
Try again.

1294
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,800
Yes, relax.

1295
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,360
Yes, okay.

1296
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:29,960
Go look at that.

1297
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,960
Go over there, yes.

1298
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,240
Okay.

1299
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,440
Jin, look at me.

1300
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,480
Look at me.

1301
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,520
Look at me, look at me.

1302
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm here.

1303
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,480
How about pulling her back first?

1304
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:43,960
Teacher.

1305
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,120
You pull her back.

1306
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,000
No, I won't.

1307
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,680
She's already out, pulling her back now...

1308
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,840
Look at me, Jin.

1309
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,360
Look down at me, I'm here.

1310
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,080
I can't look.

1311
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,320
It's okay.

1312
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,480
Nothing will happen, don't worry.

1313
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,320
Jin, it's okay.

1314
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,520
Yes, everyone come and cheer her on.

1315
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,040
No speed.

1316
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,160
It's fine.

1317
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
Are you already done?

1318
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,080
It's okay now.

1319
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
Look up.

1320
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
You're a third of the way there.

1321
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,400
I don't want to. Why is there still a third left?

1322
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,040
Look at me.

1323
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,960
Hello.

1324
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,680
Hurry.

1325
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,520
Look at me, look at me.

1326
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,440
I don't dare look at you.

1327
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,560
Just open one eye.

1328
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,400
Look.

1329
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,760
You're even with Ke Yu now.

1330
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,320
Where are you?

1331
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,120
I'm here.

1332
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm above you.

1333
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,120
Jin.

1334
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,720
Okay.

1335
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,160
We're halfway there.

1336
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,160
Halfway there.

1337
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Ke Yu, be careful.

1338
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,360
Just one more level to go.

1339
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,080
You can do it.

1340
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,320
Let me take a break, okay?

1341
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,240
I can't hold on anymore.

1342
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,560
I really can't hold on.

1343
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,280
You don't need to hold on.

1344
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,960
You don't have to hold on.

1345
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,840
Don't use too much strength.

1346
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,680
You don't need to use force.

1347
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,000
Just support it, that's enough.

1348
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,840
It's right under your feet.

1349
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,360
We're almost there, we've all made it.

1350
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,960
It's fine, even if you fall now, it's okay.

1351
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,440
Even if you fall, it's fine. We'll catch you.

1352
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,720
It's right under your feet.

1353
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,280
Ning's height is exactly where you are now.

1354
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,240
I'm holding you, see?

1355
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,560
Where is it?

1356
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,840
I'm almost there.

1357
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,480
Can't you hear my voice?

1358
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,040
Three.

1359
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,760
Two.

1360
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,200
One.

1361
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,480
Okay.

1362
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:15,960
All right.

1363
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,560
Where is it?

1364
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,360
Don't move.

1365
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,920
Okay, come on.

1366
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,560
You can do it.

1367
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,840
Got it.

1368
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,400
We're here.

1369
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,840
Relax.

1370
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,280
Let go.

1371
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,440
Relax.

1372
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:24,920
All right.

1373
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,280
It's okay.

1374
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,520
Let me help you undo it.

1375
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:27,840
All done.

1376
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,200
Stand steady.

1377
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,920
All right, we're here.

1378
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,600
All right.

1379
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,400
It's okay, all right.

1380
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,320
We're here.

1381
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,400
Okay, it's fine.

1382
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,960
It's fine.

1383
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay.

1384
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,040
No, you need to come down.

1385
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,120
Find a safe place, let's go.

1386
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,800
Good job.

1387
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,320
Awesome.

1388
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,480
Awesome.

1389
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,920
Awesome.

1390
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,360
All right.

1391
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,360
It's okay.

1392
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,280
Go back and get some rest.

1393
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,680
How are you still so pretty without makeup?

1394
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,840
Goodbye.

1395
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,640
Speaking of this rappelling,

1396
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,000
I really have to thank someone.

1397
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,960
That's my director, Mengqi.

1398
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,120
You absolutely can't cut this part out.

1399
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,640
Because at that time, I was on the rooftop.

1400
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,240
Then Mengqi rushed over to me and said

1401
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,880
She said, "Sis, maybe you should just give up."

1402
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,080
"You don't have to jump."

1403
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,920
Because I tried it myself before

1404
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,240
and I was really scared when I tried.

1405
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
I'm also afraid of heights.

1406
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
It's okay.

1407
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,960
She was just trying to comfort me.

1408
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,280
But I realized she tried it for me.

1409
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,560
Because every member of our crew

1410
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,560
has to be responsible for every part of the process.

1411
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,560
Our director

1412
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,040
has to personally go through everything.

1413
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,480
My director, Mengqi,

1414
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,040
is actually a very timid person.

1415
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,320
She's afraid of the dark, ghosts, and heights.

1416
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,760
But she still went through all the steps

1417
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,280
on my behalf.

1418
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,080
At that moment, I looked at

1419
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,360
the tall building and the sky,

1420
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,040
and the big brother behind me,

1421
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
and remembered what Mengqi said to me.

1422
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,720
She said, "It's okay."

1423
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,040
I wondered, when she's scared,

1424
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,520
who tells her, "It's okay"?

1425
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,960
She's doing her job so well.

1426
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,680
Should I

1427
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,320
give up just because of my own issues

1428
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,840
and expect others to accommodate me?

1429
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,760
I think she is also

1430
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,280
the sixth friend I've made

1431
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,440
on "Start Reasoning".

1432
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,040
I'm really grateful to her.

1433
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,160
And I'm also grateful

1434
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,280
for everyone I've met

1435
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,360
on "Start Reasoning".

1436
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,880
Look at me.

1437
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,800
Hello.

1438
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,200
A Jin.

1439
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,480
It's fine.

1440
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,840
Let me help you take it off.

1441
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,680
All done. Okay.

1442
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,080
Done.

1443
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,680
We're here.

1444
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,760
It's done.

1445
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,280
Thank you, everyone.

1446
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,480
So she knows she's very pretty too.

1447
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
She definitely knows.

1448
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,520
She definitely knows.

1449
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,560
She's already so beautiful.

1450
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,240
Try another pose.

1451
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,560
Squat down and scratch your head.

1452
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
No, move in a bit.

1453
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,920
What are you doing?

1454
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:55,840
What are you doing?

1455
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,840
Actually squatting.

1456
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,080
Feels like we're back to the days of wearing headgear.

1457
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,800
Yeah.

1458
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,320
Right?

1459
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah.

1460
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,480
Is it okay now?

1461
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,040
It's fine now.

1462
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,000
Why don't we just

1463
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,960
swing over with the wire like he just said?

1464
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,320
I think that would be cooler.

1465
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,360
That would be all of us, and it would go much smoother.

1466
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,400
First, rise up.

1467
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,200
Then use two wires, in two sections.

1468
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,600
That would...

1469
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
be cool, pulling that waistline.

1470
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,480
I thought the swinging you meant was like

1471
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,320
with our legs...

1472
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,400
Swinging over like that would be cool too.

1473
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,880
Mine is broken.

1474
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,840
The glue came off.

1475
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,760
Doesn't matter.

1476
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:37,880
Yours fell off too.

1477
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,480
Just take it off.
