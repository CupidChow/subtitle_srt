1
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,920
As last year's

2
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,880
six outstanding graduates,

3
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,400
I sincerely invite all of you

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720
to join our intensive training camp.

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
The deduction is dead.

6
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,520
Someone used the "Killer Ghost" entry

7
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
and replaced it with "Infatuated Ghost."

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,280
The person killed by the Infatuated Ghost

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,760
Right.

10
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,480
This is a case of using someone else to kill.

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,360
Does she (Ba Mian Linglong) have a reason

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,040
to instigate me?

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
But it's absolutely impossible.

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Because I don't want this matter

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
to be known by anyone.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Instigating murder

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
how is that not murder?

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,000
This is a legal issue and a moral issue.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Double culprits.

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
He instigated me, and I am the infatuated one.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,560
I only made him have the intent to kill.

22
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
He carried out the act himself.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,440
Nothing can affect

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
the progress of our company project.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,639
So our midnight intensive training camp

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
will still proceed as scheduled.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
Then I'll wait for you at midnight.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,280
Okay.

30
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,560
It's already midnight.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,720
So next,

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,320
let's all go to the boot camp together.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,600
Open an umbrella.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,200
It's raining outside.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,720
Use an umbrella.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,680
Like this.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Can we walk out with that

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,600
heir-like style?

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Can we?

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:52,920
How do we walk?

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,200
You set the rules first.

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,640
Let's do it like this.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,160
Each of us opens the umbrella like this when we go out.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,760
Then lift it up.

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
And walk forward slowly.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
Then go back.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
Then turn around and chat and laugh.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Where's the camera?

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,920
I get what you mean.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,400
Director Ning is giving instructions, Director Ning.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
Come on.

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,120
Alright.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Let's go.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Let's go.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,280
Three, two, one.

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,080
No.

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,800
The main entrance is closed right now, right?

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Aren't you the heir?

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,560
You look like a security guard now.

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Ning, the security guard, right now.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
The back door is closed too.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
This is the main entrance.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
This is the main entrance.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,080
Press it.

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Press it.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,360
It's all sealed off.

67
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
So the door is broken, right?

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Back door.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,920
Then let's check the back door.

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,680
What about this one?

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,480
This one won't open.

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
It says "Do not touch" up there.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
There's a bulldozer.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,920
What's on this bulldozer?

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
There's surveillance. There's a camera in here.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
Someone is watching us, right?

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,400
Yes.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
He's watching us right now.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
All the places we were just at?

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,880
This person is the observer.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Observer.

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
Should we get on the bulldozer?

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah, let's go up and take a look.

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,600
Go up and take a look.

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,400
Careful.

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,760
Careful.

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Come on.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,640
This is the heir.

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
So it's from the family.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Inherited the family's bulldozer.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,200
There's something inside.

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
There's something inside.

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,960
Wait a moment.

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
Just take the thing out.

95
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,240
It's a cloak.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,640
A cloak.

97
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,440
Here, take it.

98
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,080
That cloak.

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,000
There's a photo, and also...

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
Is there anything else, He?

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,600
No, that's all.

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay.

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
Alright, come down first.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Be careful.

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,160
Come down first.

106
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,800
Watch out, it's slippery.

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
Your legs are really long, all of you...

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
Alright, let's go in and take a look.

109
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay.

110
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's go.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Let's go.

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
There's nothing scary, right?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Just a tattered curtain.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,160
What's going on here?

115
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,840
It exploded.

116
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
This place is abandoned.

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Did this place explode?

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
This door is closed too.

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,200
So what should we do?

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Wait, let's check our stuff first.

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's look at what we have in our hands.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Right.

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,440
The things in our hands.

124
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,280
This is Pirate Mansion.

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
Push Billion Film Company.

126
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,840
Push Sweet Food Factory.

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,000
Look.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
Whose clothes are these?

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
But there's a photo.

130
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,760
So handsome, who is this?

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
Isn't this my idol?

132
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
You like him too?

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Seriously?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
So cute.

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,840
That's Barbie.

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,560
This is so girly.

137
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,520
Yeah.

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Wait, these are all taken secretly.

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,960
Secret shots.

140
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,240
Someone's been watching all along.

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
So now we...

142
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,880
How do we get to the training camp?

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
Alright, if we can't get in this way...

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,400
We'll have to break in.

145
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,640
We'll have to break in.

146
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's do it.

147
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,280
This is so cool.

148
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah, cut it.

149
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Cut it, cut it open.

150
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,640
Use more force.

151
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,760
Impressive, you even know how to use pliers.

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
Is there anything we can't do?

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,160
Of course not.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,560
What?

155
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Why is it so creepy here?

156
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Don't forget, someone died here.

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Don't forget, someone died here.

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
There was an explosion there.

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,240
The factory director died.

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
There's a burnt corpse smell, right?

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
Bai Dapao, go quickly.

162
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Bai Dapao, go quickly.

163
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,280
Lead the way.

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,679
Alright.

165
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,360
Wait a second.

166
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,520
There's a dead body here.

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,920
Wait a second.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
Wait a second.

169
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,160
There's a dead body here.

170
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
They're all dead.

171
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
What? I want to—

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,000
Someone died.

173
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,320
I need to protect my heart.

174
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,440
Who is it?

175
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
The leg was sawed off.

176
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,160
What is that?

177
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,800
The leg was sawed off.

178
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,840
He's practicing martial arts.

179
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,560
Wait, is this person alive?

180
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,600
Yes, they're alive.

181
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
You're so flexible.

182
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,040
You're amazing. He's so flexible.

183
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
There's another one.

184
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
What?

185
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,280
Where?

186
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
Over there, there's another one in the back.

187
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
There's another one over there.

188
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,600
It's okay.

189
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
It's fine.

190
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
No problem.

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,320
All right.

192
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,680
Okay.

193
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,040
Wait a moment.

194
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
There's one more.

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,400
Hold on.

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
There's another one.

197
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
Stop.

198
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,080
They're from the Devil Training Camp.

199
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,240
Devil, right?

200
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,000
They're acting.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
We have to act with them. Wait a second.

202
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,520
Should I do it like this?

203
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,040
Is this how I should do it?

204
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,920
Wait, what are you doing?

205
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm acting.

206
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
Wait.

207
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,200
If we stick our photos on their faces,

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,920
will it freeze them?

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,280
Yeah.

210
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,760
I've been looking for it.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,480
Stop.

212
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,640
Stop.

213
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
It's fine.

214
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't touch me.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Don't touch me.

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
All right.

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,240
Okay, that's good.

218
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,880
All right, you guys.

219
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,280
Bai, what are you doing?

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,680
If you can't beat them, join them.

221
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,960
It's okay.

222
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Let's go.

223
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,560
Hurry up.

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,640
Which way do we go?

225
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,040
Come.

226
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:30,920
Come on.

227
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
Go.

228
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,480
Cover the rear.

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Watch the back.

230
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,680
Okay.

231
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,720
Thanks for your hard work.

232
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,160
That's enough.

233
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,840
Be careful.

234
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
We can't get through.

235
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,600
Hurry, there are more behind us.

236
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,520
Move quickly.

237
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,440
Hurry up.

238
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,120
It's fine, get inside quickly.

239
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,480
Get inside.

240
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Get inside and close the door.

241
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,880
Okay, the door is closed.

242
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,360
Alright, it's done.

243
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,880
Wait a moment.

244
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
Stop.

245
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
It's actually a chase.

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
A deadly pursuit.

247
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,000
It's okay, we're safe now.

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Safe.

249
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,080
This is our...

250
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
...training?

251
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes.

252
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,560
A deadly pursuit.

253
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,840
Boot camp.

254
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
The first round tests our courage.

255
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,440
Right?

256
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,840
No, the first round tests...

257
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,240
...our brotherhood.

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
Just now, when we were walking,

259
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,480
He suddenly pulled me to the back.

260
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
To cover the rear.

261
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
To cover the rear.

262
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
I'll go first.

263
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I'll go first.

264
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm telling you, adversity reveals true character.

265
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,200
How can this help us avoid danger?

266
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,920
No, it's making me even more nervous. No.

267
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
So what should we do?

268
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
What are we supposed to do now?

269
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
We need to find a way into the office.

270
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,120
Because inside the office is...

271
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,560
We should be going into the office.

272
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,520
They're back here again.

273
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
Hurry, go to the office.

274
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,120
Hurry.

275
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,680
Kick it, quick!

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
Should I kick it?

277
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,600
Kick the door.

278
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Quick, kick it!

279
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
Should I kick it?

280
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,800
Kick it!

281
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
Kick it!

282
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Three.

283
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,600
Two.

284
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,720
One.

285
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,880
Go, now!

286
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,360
Go, now!

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Go, now!

288
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
Go, now!

289
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,120
Click.

290
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,440
You scared me to death.

291
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,280
We're filming.

292
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,360
Why did you barge in?

293
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,160
You're filming here?

294
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm filming here.

295
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,680
That was terrifying.

296
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
I was scared to death.

297
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,760
I really...

298
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,320
...was scared to death.

299
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,800
I don't have time to mess around with you.

300
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
Why did you come here?

301
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,680
Cut.

302
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,320
Cut.

303
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,440
Cut.

304
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,240
Okay, cut.

305
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Where's the director?

306
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,920
Director.

307
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Director, how was my acting?

308
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,920
Come on, cut.

309
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,040
Come on, stand over there.

310
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Cover the rear.

311
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,120
Cover the rear.

312
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,200
Bro.

313
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,120
Cover the rear.

314
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,160
You startled me.

315
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,440
We're in the middle of filming.

316
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,200
What's wrong with you guys?

317
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
You started acting without even seeing who it was.

318
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
No, what does this have to do with us?

319
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,520
Come on, let's stand over here.

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Let's squat in the front.

321
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Let's squat.

322
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,320
Squat here.

323
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Are we actors or criminals?

324
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,640
No need, you don't have to squat.

325
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Why are you guys here?

326
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Didn't you say

327
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
to let us come find you?

328
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,080
Aren't we supposed to be training?

329
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Isn't this a boot camp?

330
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Boot camp training.

331
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,080
It's already twelve o'clock.

332
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,760
Yeah.

333
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Director, what should we do?

334
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,960
Just give us a number.

335
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,560
I...

336
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, we've been at this for so long.

337
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,120
It took me so much effort to create this art.

338
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
I got too into it.

339
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,760
Sorry.

340
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,640
You guys can disperse now.

341
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Go reset the scene.

342
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,880
Then we'll have to reshoot in a bit.

343
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,040
We have to reshoot?

344
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,760
No.

345
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,160
The last take is invalid.

346
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
Why is it invalid?

347
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,640
Because they barged in.

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Seriously,

349
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
this is just unprofessional.

350
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
You guys are so unprofessional, seriously.

351
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,360
You guys,

352
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,480
You, get out.

353
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
You don't even know they're filming.

354
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,320
Honestly.

355
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,400
Come on, don't leave.

356
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Come back.

357
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Okay.

358
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,120
Alright, you guys can go.

359
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,280
Hurry up and set things up.

360
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,720
Set things up.

361
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,920
Alright, let's go.

362
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Sorry.

363
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Thanks for your hard work.

364
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,880
Sorry.

365
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,720
Excuse me.

366
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,040
Thanks for your effort.

367
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
Our crew's rules—

368
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
Everyone, please—

369
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,359
Sorry.

370
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:04,640
Come on.

371
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,119
So, our boot camp here—

372
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,920
Why do we call it a boot camp?

373
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,920
Why is that?

374
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,119
Because the theme of our show

375
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,200
is set at the end of the world.

376
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,880
This script was adapted by a director whose films have grossed billions.

377
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
He personally adapted it.

378
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
This story is about

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,640
a terrifying infection that breaks out at the end of the world.

380
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,960
Those who are infected turn into monsters.

381
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,599
The lower-level monsters

382
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,000
are like what you just saw.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,040
They have no consciousness.

384
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
The higher-level ones still retain some awareness.

385
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,160
Now,

386
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
let's go visit the second floor.

387
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
There's also a training room on the second floor.

388
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,680
It's also a very important place.

389
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,360
Follow me.

390
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay.

391
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,040
This way.

392
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,640
Great.

393
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,360
Over here.

394
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,200
What that girl was doing just now was

395
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
aerial yoga.

396
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,040
Yes, aerial yoga.

397
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,400
That's impressive.

398
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
This design is pretty good, right?

399
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,440
That really startled me.

400
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,840
That just now also startled me.

401
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,120
Because as soon as I turned around,

402
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,800
she jumped down right then, you know?

403
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
I even turned to look at you guys.

404
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,280
Can we get up there?

405
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,440
Really?

406
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
It can't hold us up. It would take two guys to support it.

407
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I think it can hold.

408
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,680
Really? It actually works?

409
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
You're amazing.

410
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,960
That's dangerous.

411
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
Don't mess around.

412
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,400
That girl just now—

413
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Did she put her foot there?

414
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
Yeah.

415
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
Come on.

416
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,560
Let's go this way.

417
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
Then let's go from here.

418
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,280
What's going on here?

419
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,840
Didn't you guys do this?

420
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
Why did this collapse?

421
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,160
It was like this when we got here.

422
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
I even reinforced these stairs.

423
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
I think you should get a new construction crew.

424
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,280
Everything you've reinforced seems to have problems.

425
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
I just didn't coordinate with them properly.

426
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
You're not going to make us—

427
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,040
—clear this passage, are you?

428
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,280
Go ahead and clear it.

429
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
Alright, let's clear it.

430
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,000
How can we let the director do it?

431
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,840
Right? See, you're so considerate.

432
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Come on, you go first.

433
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
Come on.

434
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,640
You go first.

435
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,240
Strongman.

436
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,440
You want the girls to do it?

437
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,560
Why are you making me go?

438
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,640
I don't know. None of us know.

439
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,040
I hate you.

440
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,800
I hate you.

441
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,840
What is this thing?

442
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Someone's dead again.

443
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,040
What do you mean?

444
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
How did this happen?

445
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,280
Who is this?

446
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,080
Wait a second.

447
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
What's wrong?

448
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
Do you know him?

449
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't know him.

450
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,960
What's on his head?

451
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
A knife.

452
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
Let's go over this.

453
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Go ahead.

454
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,760
Because when we were filming,

455
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,880
everyone had an alibi for each other.

456
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,520
Right.

457
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,120
So,

458
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,720
the company staff also

459
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,480
all got off work at ten.

460
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,400
So only you guys were left.

461
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,400
No.

462
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm not the same as you five.

463
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,360
I have a real alibi.

464
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,720
Me too.

465
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,320
Because I'm a livestream king on Weibo.

466
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,680
Alright.

467
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm not the old Mr. Liu anymore.

468
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
You're the new livestream king.

469
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,080
Yes.

470
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,920
I have people from all over the world as my witnesses.

471
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,440
Alright, how about this.

472
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,680
No matter what,

473
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,040
you still need to discreetly find out

474
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,200
who the culprit is.

475
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,920
How can we be discreet about this?

476
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,720
How can we be discreet about this?

477
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,000
The project

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,440
still needs to continue.

479
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
The path above

480
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,920
definitely shouldn't be taken any further.

481
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Okay.

482
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,920
Alright.

483
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll give this to you.

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Puzzle-solving and reasoning test.

485
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,760
Tongcheng is fully online.

486
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,880
This is something Tongcheng Travel prepared for everyone.

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,440
It's a tool to help with evidence collection.

488
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,440
I hope it can help everyone organize the clues.

489
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,080
Clarify the logic and explore the truth.

490
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,920
Let's set off together with Tongcheng.

491
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,240
Thank you.

492
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Here.

493
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,080
Give it to her.

494
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,800
I can't carry it.

495
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,640
I can't carry it.

496
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
Then let my little assistant help carry it.

497
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm not your assistant.

498
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,000
You lost your infatuation with me so quickly?

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Yes.

500
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,520
Okay.

501
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:16,880
No.

502
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,520
Then investigate discreetly.

503
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,440
Remember, you must be careful.

504
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,840
Don't let any information leak.

505
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
The project must continue.

506
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,680
Alright.

507
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,800
No problem.

508
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,560
I'll go handle the aftermath.

509
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm going to settle the score with that shoddy construction project.

510
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Okay.

511
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,200
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

512
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Case Six officially begins.

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,520
It is now 2025.

514
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,360
April 23rd, 12:30 AM.

515
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,560
The identity of the victim in this case is unknown.

516
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,520
After a preliminary investigation,

517
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
the suspect has been narrowed down to

518
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
Ba Mian Linglong,

519
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Prince Charming,

520
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
the famous one,

521
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
from the Koban background,

522
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,040
prefers quality over quantity,

523
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,360
among these five people.

524
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,200
A golden reputation.

525
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,920
Because they were streaming live during the break,

526
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
they can be ruled out as a suspect.

527
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
You are the detective for this case.

528
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,200
Now, please question the suspects

529
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,040
and begin your investigation.

530
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,880
Come on, everyone speak up.

531
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,840
It's finally my turn today.

532
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,320
No one should expect to get off easy.

533
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't laugh.

534
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,320
I just find her funny.

535
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,800
Alright, let's go one by one.

536
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,120
What is your relationship with the victim?

537
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,920
I don't know them.

538
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,800
If you don't know them, why would you kill them?

539
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,360
Okay, the stress test is complete.

540
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,080
You, come here.

541
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,720
You, come here.

542
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,200
This one of mine...

543
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
This one of mine...

544
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,360
Lock the suspect.

545
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,880
Lock the suspect.

546
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,760
Alright, so I don't know him.

547
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
You don't know him either.

548
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,440
That's right.

549
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,040
Come on, you say it.

550
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,440
Don't tell me you don't know him.

551
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,880
If anyone else says they don't know him,

552
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,680
I'll send you straight to the small room.

553
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,440
I don't know him.

554
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,160
I don't know him either.

555
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,960
Why did you flirt with her?

556
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
No, I didn't.

557
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,480
Because she said

558
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
no one is allowed to say they don't know.

559
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,760
So I said I don't know either.

560
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,360
You really took my words to heart.

561
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,240
I get it.

562
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,400
You do the same to him.

563
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
I want to see his reaction.

564
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,480
Now you say it.

565
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,760
Can you not be like this?

566
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,240
Your whole body is trying to avoid it.

567
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,680
Always like this.

568
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,360
That's just how he is.

569
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
He's scared.

570
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Scared of me.

571
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
He's afraid of me now.

572
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
He's afraid of you now.

573
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
None of us know each other.

574
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
Really, we don't know each other.

575
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,360
Let's search.

576
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Okay.

577
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
Like this, just take a look around.

578
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,680
What's up with this door?

579
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,640
Move it out first.

580
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,400
What's this?

581
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,240
A hammer.

582
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,120
There's colored paint here.

583
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Colored paint.

584
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
Where would you hit to get colored paint on the hammer?

585
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,720
Isn't there color on that stone slab?

586
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Yeah, look.

587
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
Pink, blue, green.

588
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,160
It's the same colors as on here.

589
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,600
So if he stood outside and hit it,

590
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
everything would fall down.

591
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Then the rebar would stab into him.

592
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,800
Maybe he was

593
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,160
coming down from the second floor.

594
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,280
For example, if there was a support here.

595
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,400
After hitting it,

596
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,360
after he was crushed to death,

597
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,960
I hid this thing there.

598
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,640
Then I ran away.

599
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,000
That's possible.

600
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,760
You're getting the hang of it, bro.

601
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,120
No, I'm just identifying the culprit.

602
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,160
It's not your turn to identify the culprit.

603
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,760
I'm the real detective.

604
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,280
Another murder.

605
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,800
About to kill again.

606
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,320
Come on.

607
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,800
We need to search carefully.

608
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
Let's move the stones first.

609
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,760
Take it inside.

610
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,400
Three, two, one

611
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,240
Don't come over here

612
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,200
How did this happen?

613
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,840
Go in

614
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
Let's go with this

615
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,360
This is it

616
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,320
Like this

617
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,600
Okay

618
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,240
I want to check the rebar in his head

619
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,760
Did it go all the way through?

620
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,560
It went through

621
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,280
His clothes

622
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,880
These should be extras' clothes, right?

623
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,520
Looks like it

624
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,960
And he's also one of the people playing a "zombie"

625
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,800
Why do you say that?

626
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
Because look at the makeup on his hands and stuff

627
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,720
Is this makeup?

628
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Not sure, right now

629
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,800
We can't confirm it right now

630
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,600
Whether it's zombie makeup

631
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,040
Or if he's actually injured

632
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Rhymed

633
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,200
Did you check all the pockets?

634
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,680
This sleeve has been torn off.

635
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,200
Did you see it?

636
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,480
It's very even here.

637
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,320
So, he wanted to play

638
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
a trendy West Coast "zombie".

639
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,120
He's going for that West Coast vibe.

640
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,880
So he's a monster from the West.

641
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,320
That's why his hair is this color.

642
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,800
Right? Makes sense, doesn't it?

643
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,080
That's right.

644
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
He has this injury on his hand.

645
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,320
This injury might have been caused by someone hitting him.

646
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,520
For example, if someone swung a stick at him,

647
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,280
he could have blocked it with his hand.

648
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,200
That's possible.

649
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,760
Take a look at that hand.

650
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,800
This one is injured too.

651
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
This one was clearly burned by a cigar.

652
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,160
A cigar.

653
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,000
This is a burn.

654
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,440
Really, this is definitely a burn.

655
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,160
A burn.

656
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,600
Yes.

657
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
Since he's an extra, we need to ask around.

658
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,240
Let's go and ask those colleagues from earlier.

659
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,040
Boss lady, lead the way.

660
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,680
Come on, follow me.

661
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,200
Famous sign ahead, there's a ghost up front.

662
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
Sorry.

663
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,400
Sorry to disturb your rest.

664
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,120
Sorry to interrupt your break.

665
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
Because we're looking for

666
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
We're urgently looking for someone with red hair.

667
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
One of your extras—have you seen them?

668
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
No, we haven't.

669
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
Our group leader is over there.

670
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
You can ask them.

671
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Group leader.

672
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,760
Let's go.

673
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,200
Sorry.

674
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,320
You guys go ahead and play, okay.

675
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,480
Where's the group leader?

676
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Group leader, teacher, group leader.

677
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
Teacher.

678
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
The one inside just now.

679
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Group leader.

680
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,160
Group leader.

681
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,480
Sorry.

682
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,560
Was that the boy inside just now, next to the director?

683
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,880
What does this mean?

684
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
The lounge is locked.

685
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,520
What does that mean?

686
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
Pull it out and see what it is.

687
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,240
Wait a second.

688
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,520
No.

689
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,240
Tug of war.

690
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,720
Tug of war, hurry!

691
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,480
What does that mean?

692
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,960
Pull.

693
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:21,840
Pull.

694
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,080
Pull.

695
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Why?

696
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
There's a key on it, so we have to pull.

697
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,800
Pull.

698
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,160
Don't pull.

699
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,560
Pull.

700
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,200
One, two, three.

701
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
One, two, three.

702
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,320
One, two, three.

703
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
One, two, three.

704
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,320
One, two, three.

705
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,880
One, two, three.

706
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Wait a second.

707
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,320
Wait a second.

708
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,120
Wait a second.

709
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Wait a second.

710
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Wait, okay.

711
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, pause for a moment.

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,560
Pause for a moment.

713
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,680
Watch your hands.

714
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,520
You two aren't wearing gloves.

715
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,040
Watch your hands.

716
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
Someone on our side isn't wearing gloves.

717
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,080
I feel like I'm about to attend a wedding or something.

718
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,240
The groom is about to barge in.

719
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,680
Why is this so hard?

720
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,320
Should we stand crisscrossed?

721
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,160
I'll stand on this side.

722
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,920
Cross your hands, like this.

723
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,560
Like this.

724
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm a pro at tug-of-war.

725
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,920
When I was a kid, they called me

726
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,520
the Prince of Tug-of-War.

727
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
Pull sneakily, quick!

728
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,720
Three!

729
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,120
Stop counting, hurry, pull sneakily!

730
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Pull back quietly, quick!

731
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,480
Pull back quickly, stop talking!

732
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
That's not playing fair.

733
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,080
You started tug-of-war without even telling me.

734
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
Don't rush.

735
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,800
We're just resting here, what are you guys doing?

736
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,280
Who cares what they're doing, let's go!

737
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,440
Since someone dares to challenge us,

738
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,720
we, He Li Mo and Jin Yu, can't lose!

739
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,760
We are He Li, Mo, and Jin Yu.

740
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,320
Are you ready?

741
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,640
Okay, let's go. Come on.

742
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:09,880
Come on.

743
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
Come on, three.

744
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,320
Two.

745
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,640
One.

746
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,400
Go!

747
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,000
Three, two, one, go!

748
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,960
Three, two, one, go!

749
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,760
Go!

750
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
One, two, three.

751
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,400
Go!

752
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
One, two, three.

753
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,720
One, two, three.

754
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,200
One, two, three.

755
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,840
One, two, three.

756
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,480
One, two, three.

757
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
One, two, three.

758
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,760
Pull!

759
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,200
One, two, three.

760
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,840
One, two, three.

761
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,440
One, two, three.

762
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,200
Pull!

763
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,880
One, two, three.

764
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
One, two, three.

765
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,280
One, two, three.

766
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,120
One, two, three.

767
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,800
One, two, three.

768
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
One, two, three.

769
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
One, two, three.

770
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,360
One, two, three.

771
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640
One, two, three.

772
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Relax.

773
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,400
Hurry.

774
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
It's fine.

775
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,800
It's fine.

776
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,520
It's fine.

777
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
Let me ask, what exactly did you guys do?

778
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,800
Kicking the door and taking my keys—

779
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You stop talking for now.

780
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,680
Wait a moment.

781
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
Let me rest for a bit.

782
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,440
Wait a second.

783
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,200
Wait a second.

784
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,880
Wait a second.

785
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
Let me rest for a bit.

786
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,800
What are you doing?

787
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,760
In the middle of the night like this—

788
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,360
How about this—

789
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,440
You guys go to the back and rest for now.

790
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,520
There will probably be more filming later.

791
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,480
Alright?

792
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay.

793
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,120
Rest for now.

794
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,080
Thank you, leader.

795
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
Unlocking the door

796
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,000
Then why were you playing tug-of-war with me?

797
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
That's my key.

798
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
How could I not grab it?

799
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Alright.

800
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,480
Okay, come on.

801
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,520
Let's not talk about anything else, let's fight first.

802
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,680
Hit me.

803
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,520
Hit me.

804
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,400
You just kicked my door open.

805
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,600
Okay.

806
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,640
Let's talk about something serious.

807
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,320
What serious thing?

808
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,520
Do you know a guy with red hair?

809
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
Wait, why are you looking for him? What happened to him?

810
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,080
He's dead.

811
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm so happy I could die.

812
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm so happy I could die.

813
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
No, we just want to find him.

814
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,080
We, um...

815
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Yeah, we have something to discuss with him.

816
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,120
We have something to discuss with him.

817
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,800
You're looking for him?

818
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,440
No one could possibly die here.

819
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,240
We're all just filming here.

820
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,640
Yeah.

821
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,400
Yes.

822
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,840
Yes.

823
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,280
Yes.

824
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,840
Okay.

825
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,240
I roughly know everyone here.

826
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,360
An exact number.

827
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,280
But I can't

828
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
match each person exactly.

829
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,560
That list

830
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,720
Are you trying to become a rap star?

831
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Where is your accent from?

832
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,280
I see.

833
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,800
Are there any other distinguishing features?

834
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,440
You're looking for someone, right?

835
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,000
Red hair.

836
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
Red hair.

837
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,800
Someone with red hair.

838
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
And one sleeve on their clothes is there,

839
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
and the other sleeve is missing.

840
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,600
Pretty muscular, has some muscles.

841
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,880
That's impossible.

842
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
All my actors here have sleeves.

843
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,440
All the sleeves are intact.

844
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,080
Then it must have been torn off, right.

845
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,880
All our actors' files

846
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
are on my assistant director's computer.

847
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,640
Come with me.

848
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,240
He's not here anymore.

849
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,440
Okay.

850
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,040
Keep your voice down.

851
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,960
This is my assistant director's office.

852
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,720
This is my assistant director's computer.

853
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,520
And the mouse.

854
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,560
All the actors' files

855
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,320
are on our assistant director's computer.

856
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,440
Alright.

857
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,800
Also, among our actors, there are five

858
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,080
who are top extras.

859
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,240
They are quite experienced.

860
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,120
All the information

861
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
all the information about the actors

862
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,160
they should all know.

863
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,080
I think if you can find those five

864
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,520
it will be a big help to you.

865
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,960
Alright?

866
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,480
Alright.

867
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,760
But,

868
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
I've never opened

869
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,120
our assistant director's computer.

870
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,840
If you want to open the assistant director's computer,

871
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,600
you have to become the assistant director.

872
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
But what's the most important thing to become the assistant director?

873
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,360
What?

874
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
Having good judgment.

875
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,440
Each time you complete an extra training wall,

876
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,960
you get thirty seconds of viewing access.

877
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,920
Each time you complete the background actor training wall

878
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,639
you get thirty seconds of viewing access.

879
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,800
All the actor profiles

880
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
are on our assistant director's computer.

881
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,920
The top background actors know all the extras.

882
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,840
After we finish this training,

883
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
we'll see who the five top background actors are.

884
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,199
Then, based on those five,

885
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,880
we'll go find those five top background actors.

886
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,080
Ask them who the red-haired person is.

887
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,239
Right, among those people just now.

888
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,840
That's correct.

889
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,600
Okay.

890
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,639
Very clear.

891
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,920
I can tell you what this is.

892
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,440
I can tell you what this is.

893
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,199
Have you ever used a talking pen?

894
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,560
What is that?

895
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,960
A talking pen.

896
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,840
Wherever it lights up, you tap there.

897
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Let me show you.

898
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,080
Start.

899
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,719
Training begins.

900
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,440
It's starting now.

901
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,239
If you don't capture it,

902
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,520
it's a failure.

903
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,840
That fast?

904
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,320
Yes.

905
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
Otherwise, I've never used his computer before.

906
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,280
I'll head out first.

907
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,880
Alright.

908
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,560
Hope you find the person.

909
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,320
No problem.

910
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,680
Alright.

911
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,240
I guess it will

912
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,760
be soon.

913
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,400
All six of us will be jumping for joy.

914
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,280
I don't know.

915
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,080
It's all so hectic.

916
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,240
What kind of game is this?

917
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,320
Is it about pressing the lights?

918
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,600
One question is, why?

919
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,640
Why did he set it so high?

920
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Why make it so high?

921
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,200
Because we have three people who are 1.9 meters tall.

922
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,840
Right.

923
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,120
So cool.

924
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,920
So cool.

925
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,880
Seriously, I'll leave this to you.

926
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,840
This whole row is mine, okay?

927
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,360
No, you two should each take one of the high ones.

928
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
Right.

929
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,520
I think you two can't reach the lower ones.

930
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,000
I'll help you two with the lower ones.

931
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,680
So the two of us can just rest, right?

932
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,560
Alright, let's do it.

933
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,560
Then us girls will take care of the three small ones at the bottom.

934
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Is that okay?

935
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,600
Sure.

936
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,720
Alright, I'll take these few.

937
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,440
These two high ones, you two.

938
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,520
There's a high one here.

939
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,640
These few are just right for me.

940
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,760
Yeah, these four.

941
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,520
Then bring a chair over.

942
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,160
Bring a chair over.

943
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,720
Bring a chair, right.

944
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,160
Will this work?

945
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,160
That works too, this is fine too.

946
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,120
Start.

947
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,320
Okay, three—

948
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,920
Three.

949
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,080
Training failed.

950
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,440
Which one?

951
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,920
This one.

952
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
It's this one. Pressed too late.

953
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,320
It's okay, try again.

954
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
How about we take a look at this?

955
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,560
Press it again.

956
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,080
Let's check the rhythm first.

957
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,760
Okay, go ahead.

958
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,840
Training starts.

959
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,000
All lights on.

960
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,680
This one.

961
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,040
Press.

962
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,760
Training failed.

963
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,200
When it lights up, you have to press it immediately, right?

964
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,880
Right.

965
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,720
Try again.

966
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,640
Okay.

967
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Then I'll focus.

968
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,240
Just watch your own.

969
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,600
Go ahead.

970
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:07,960
Alright?

971
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,680
Go.

972
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm starting.

973
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,440
Three, two, one, start.

974
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,960
Training starts.

975
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Getting ready to turn on the computer in the next second.

976
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,520
Not yet.

977
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,080
Impressive.

978
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,640
Alright, keep it up.

979
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,320
Go for it.

980
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,640
Nice.

981
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,000
Passed.

982
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,200
Nice.

983
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,920
Look.

984
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,040
How do you see it?

985
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,480
Wait a moment.

986
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,080
Wait a moment.

987
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,080
Gold medal.

988
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,920
Full set, there's a full set.

989
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,360
Including a card.

990
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Gold medal.

991
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,720
No, not a full gold.

992
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,240
This one.

993
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Look at another one.

994
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,080
This one.

995
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,320
Alright, got it.

996
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,040
Look at another one.

997
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,720
Just in case.

998
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,520
This girl.

999
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,160
The one in the white sweater.

1000
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,840
She has an earring on the left.

1001
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,160
They were just there.

1002
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,040
She was just at the table.

1003
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Remember, there's one more.

1004
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,480
Full, discard, extra.

1005
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,760
Alright, let's go again. Come on.

1006
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,040
Were you able to remember what they looked like just now?

1007
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,440
I really can't remember faces.

1008
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,040
There was a girl.

1009
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,840
She was wearing a white sweater.

1010
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,800
Her sweater—are you sure she was actually wearing a sweater?

1011
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,280
That was their own sweater.

1012
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,920
There was one with a middle part.

1013
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,520
And a girl with straight bangs.

1014
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,240
Right.

1015
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,120
Okay.

1016
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,800
Very clear.

1017
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,800
No.

1018
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,680
So we don't have to look for just those three?

1019
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,400
Or do we still have to?

1020
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,920
Remember them first.

1021
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,600
We need to remember five.

1022
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
We have to find all five. Let's go.

1023
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,840
Come on, let's do it again.

1024
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,600
Come on, one more time.

1025
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,160
Nice, keep it up!

1026
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,560
Three, two, one.

1027
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,360
Training starts now.

1028
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,720
You can do it!

1029
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
Keep going!

1030
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Beautiful.

1031
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,280
Beautiful.

1032
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,560
Continue.

1033
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,200
This time, look from above.

1034
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,320
Because you just looked down like this.

1035
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
Start from the top, the first one.

1036
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,800
This one.

1037
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,520
The one with the middle part.

1038
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,920
This one.

1039
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,360
Right.

1040
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,520
This one.

1041
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,440
Thick lips.

1042
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,000
Big eyes, thick lips.

1043
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,560
This one.

1044
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,440
This one.

1045
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,440
This one is handsome.

1046
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,800
So handsome.

1047
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,400
This one.

1048
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,520
He has a mole at the corner of his mouth.

1049
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
That's all, right? We're done?

1050
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,480
Just these few.

1051
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,200
One, two, three, four, five. Right.

1052
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,840
Let's look for him. Let's look.

1053
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,320
Let's go.

1054
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,320
Let's go.

1055
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,920
Go.

1056
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,560
Go.

1057
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,920
Extras.

1058
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Gather up.

1059
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,640
Hurry up.

1060
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,200
Meal time.

1061
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,960
Come quickly.

1062
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,920
Is it the one with his head down?

1063
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,560
Hello everyone, look over here.

1064
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,040
This boy, right?

1065
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,240
We need to go over there, right?

1066
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,000
We need to go over there.

1067
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,520
We can go in.

1068
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,000
Is it this one?

1069
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,000
Is it him? Is he the one?

1070
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,080
But he doesn't really look like it.

1071
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Yes, it's him. He's one of them.

1072
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,960
Really?

1073
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,280
Look.

1074
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,080
Yes, it's him. He's one of them.

1075
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,880
Top extra.

1076
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,120
We want to ask you something.

1077
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,000
Do you know

1078
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,240
in your team,

1079
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,960
is there a young guy with red hair?

1080
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,760
A young guy with red hair.

1081
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm not really sure about that.

1082
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
There are so many extras, how could I know all of them?

1083
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,680
I only remember

1084
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,080
a few hours ago

1085
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,920
I saw a strange person.

1086
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
He seemed to go up to the second floor from the back door.

1087
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,040
Went up to the second floor from the back door.

1088
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,440
He was probably called up there, I think.

1089
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,320
I don't know anything else.

1090
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,720
Okay.

1091
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Got it. Okay.

1092
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,040
Are you a top extra?

1093
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,320
I am.

1094
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,000
He isn't.

1095
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
But he has more than a top extra.

1096
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm a "sacrifice" extra. I'm willing to get splashed with water.

1097
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
There's even this kind of thing?

1098
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,680
There's a punishment for making a mistake.

1099
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,960
You scared me.

1100
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,080
How about we go take another look over there?

1101
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,760
Okay.

1102
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,920
There weren't any top extras among those people just now?

1103
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,560
No, there weren't.

1104
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,880
So what about that person just now?

1105
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,720
Does he know him?

1106
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,480
He said last night—

1107
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,360
Well, just a few hours ago—

1108
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,400
He saw him go up to the second floor from the back door.

1109
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,560
He was asked to go by someone.

1110
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,040
He didn't say he was asked to go.

1111
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,960
He just said he went up.

1112
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,120
I inferred that he was asked to go.

1113
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,960
What makes you think that?

1114
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,760
Because I'm smart.

1115
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,960
Do you accept that?

1116
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,800
Take a look.

1117
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,880
Wake up.

1118
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
No, that's not it.

1119
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,560
The guy with the middle part.

1120
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,320
Aren't you annoying?

1121
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,120
Aren't you annoying?

1122
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,520
You splashed your classmate.

1123
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,360
He's so innocent.

1124
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,320
Why?

1125
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,840
One of those two.

1126
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,440
What are you doing here?

1127
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,520
Still investigating here.

1128
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,120
Do you know someone with red hair?

1129
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,880
I knew it.

1130
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,080
I knew it.

1131
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,200
The one lying over there.

1132
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,600
The girl in the corner should be the one.

1133
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,880
Is that girl really the one?

1134
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,720
It has to be one of these two girls.

1135
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,360
I think it's her.

1136
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,080
I think she looks like it too.

1137
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Stop arguing.

1138
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,440
Stop arguing.

1139
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
Not this one, the one inside.

1140
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,560
Who's going to check?

1141
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,840
Who dares to check?

1142
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,760
She might throw water.

1143
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,920
Hello, he has a question for you.

1144
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,280
What is it? Can't you let people sleep?

1145
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,200
It seems to be her.

1146
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,240
Are you a top extra?

1147
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,600
Are you?

1148
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,560
So pretty, you must be, right?

1149
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,280
Yes.

1150
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,240
Definitely the kind who

1151
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,720
gets invited to stand in the front row.

1152
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,640
Have you seen a

1153
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,000
red-haired

1154
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,520
man?

1155
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,720
Among your extras,

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,360
we don't have any extras with red hair.

1157
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,680
Right, but he dyed his hair red.

1158
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,640
It was really eye-catching.

1159
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,080
I didn't notice.

1160
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,520
But I think I

1161
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,800
on the night of the 22nd

1162
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,320
probably before 8:30

1163
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I saw someone

1164
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,720
very strange.

1165
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,120
How strange?

1166
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,960
Because at that time,

1167
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,240
he suddenly bit

1168
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,440
his own right elbow.

1169
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,160
Was he trying to bite it, or actually biting it?

1170
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,280
He actually bit his right elbow.

1171
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,360
Right here?

1172
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,920
Yes.

1173
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,640
And on his elbow

1174
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,680
there were very noticeable red marks.

1175
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,320
That's him—the red marks.

1176
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,600
I remember now.

1177
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,720
This person isn't one of our extras.

1178
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,040
So who is he to you?

1179
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,920
We don't know him.

1180
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,160
We've never seen him before.

1181
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,080
He just showed up that day

1182
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,040
near our factory.

1183
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,680
The 22nd—that was last night.

1184
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,200
Yes, before 8:30 last night.

1185
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,240
That's all.

1186
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,840
Yes, I can't remember anything else.

1187
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,800
Alright.

1188
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,440
There's... there's one more person.

1189
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,840
There's someone here who's a bit disturbed.

1190
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,160
You go.

1191
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't dare.

1192
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,040
Alright, no need to ask.

1193
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,000
This is definitely it.

1194
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,280
Yes.

1195
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,760
This is...

1196
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,160
Definitely.

1197
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,720
It's definitely him.

1198
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,160
Yes.

1199
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,000
What's wrong with you?

1200
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,400
What's wrong with you?

1201
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,920
This is definitely a top extra.

1202
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,120
Because he's still acting even after the cameras stopped.

1203
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,040
Didn't you see me here?

1204
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,040
He is...

1205
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,040
He is...

1206
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,960
You're a top extra, right?

1207
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,840
What do you all call me?

1208
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,360
Top extra.

1209
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,480
Top extra.

1210
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,560
What?

1211
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,320
I understand.

1212
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,480
Are you the directors?

1213
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,840
Yes.

1214
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,680
Hello, teachers.

1215
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,440
My front, side, and back.

1216
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,840
Side, front, and a smile.

1217
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,400
How is it?

1218
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,520
Is there any work you need me for?

1219
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,720
That's not important. None of that matters.

1220
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,360
What's important is whether you know

1221
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,960
someone with red hair.

1222
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,320
An extra.

1223
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,160
Your colleague.

1224
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,880
You just joined, right?

1225
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,320
Yes.

1226
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,040
Our crew isn't allowed to dye their hair.

1227
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,640
But I do know

1228
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,960
we lost a piece of clothing.

1229
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Was it a plaid shirt?

1230
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,960
I'm not sure about that.

1231
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,560
I just remembered.

1232
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,320
I was

1233
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,480
on the morning of the 22nd

1234
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,280
and I think I saw a strange person.

1235
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,800
At that time,

1236
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,920
he was in the corner of the tent area,

1237
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,760
squatting there for a while, and then...

1238
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
No way.

1239
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,200
Seriously?

1240
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,440
Could he be like me,

1241
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
an introvert?

1242
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,600
On the morning of the 22nd,

1243
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,240
I did see a very strange person.

1244
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,280
At that time,

1245
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,680
he was in the corner of the tent area.

1246
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,320
He squatted there for a while.

1247
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,680
Then he put something

1248
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,000
into a storage locker.

1249
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,880
Tonight,

1250
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,840
out of kindness,

1251
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
I saw that the locker was open,

1252
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,640
so I closed it.

1253
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,360
And then, you can

1254
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,240
try it yourselves.

1255
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,160
Scan the code to open the locker.

1256
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,680
Okay.

1257
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,480
Then I'll go practice.

1258
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,080
Alright.

1259
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,240
Alright, thanks for your hard work.

1260
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,360
Alright, let's go.

1261
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,120
Let's go to the tent first.

1262
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,520
Then head to the locker area.

1263
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,800
They said

1264
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,240
there's also a wardrobe.

1265
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,600
Okay.

1266
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,520
You really seem like an assistant director.

1267
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,840
Where's the tent?

1268
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,720
It's huge.

1269
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,640
This really is a nice place.

1270
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,320
There are still a few we haven't found.

1271
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,080
There are two left.

1272
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,840
Two more.

1273
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,520
Still two.

1274
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,120
Just look for the handsome ones.

1275
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,400
Look for the super handsome type.

1276
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,920
That one's handsome.

1277
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,400
This one's handsome.

1278
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,160
The really handsome kind.

1279
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,640
This one is very handsome.

1280
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,280
Just sitting here gives off a great vibe, this one.

1281
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,680
This one.

1282
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,120
It has to be him, he's so handsome.

1283
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,680
Hey man.

1284
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,920
I want to ask you something.

1285
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,160
Have you seen a

1286
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,960
sneaky-looking person?

1287
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,320
Someone with red hair.

1288
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,760
Haven't seen him.

1289
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,800
But yesterday,

1290
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,520
I did see someone strange.

1291
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah, he said something to me.

1292
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,000
What did he say?

1293
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,240
He asked me about this place.

1294
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,520
He asked me where this is.

1295
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,480
I told him this is at the foot of Tiebu Mountain.

1296
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,600
It's a film set converted from an abandoned factory.

1297
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
And that was it, he just left.

1298
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,280
Just

1299
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,120
acting all mysterious.

1300
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
There's a handsome guy here.

1301
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,680
This one is really handsome too.

1302
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,360
Someone this handsome must be—

1303
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,640
This one is also so handsome.

1304
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
He's about to laugh.

1305
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,480
He's already laughing.

1306
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,600
He can't hold it in anymore.

1307
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,160
The corners of his mouth look like an AK.

1308
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,480
Are you a top extra?

1309
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,880
Yes.

1310
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,040
Yes.

1311
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Yes.

1312
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,400
I just became a top extra.

1313
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,240
I'm so happy.

1314
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,320
Happy? We're happy for you too.

1315
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:07,760
We can tell.

1316
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,200
Are you guys celebrities?

1317
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,440
Why are you all so good-looking?

1318
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,480
We're not as good-looking as you.

1319
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,640
So, have you seen anyone suspicious around this factory?

1320
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,920
Have you seen a suspicious person?

1321
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,760
On the morning of the 22nd,

1322
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,920
around eight or nine o'clock,

1323
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,440
Eight or nine o'clock.

1324
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,840
I saw someone

1325
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,960
sneaking around here.

1326
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,760
What was he doing?

1327
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,400
Stealing clothes.

1328
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,120
We lost a piece of clothing.

1329
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,800
Do you remember what the clothing looked like?

1330
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,120
He was wearing a hospital gown.

1331
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,920
He stole a piece of clothing.

1332
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,400
After that, I also saw him at the factory

1333
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,040
and at the entrance of the film company.

1334
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,800
I saw him there.

1335
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,720
He was wandering around aimlessly.

1336
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,800
Then I wanted

1337
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,920
to go ask him for the clothing back.

1338
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,080
But I couldn't go.

1339
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,640
Why not?

1340
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,320
Because our group leader told me the director was calling me.

1341
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,640
I thought I was getting more scenes.

1342
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,240
Did you get them?

1343
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,080
Did it work out?

1344
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,040
No, I didn't get them.

1345
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,800
Alright, keep working hard.

1346
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,600
Let's work hard together.

1347
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,160
Okay.

1348
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,520
Thank you.

1349
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:02,960
Thanks.

1350
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,680
Good luck to you all.

1351
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,320
Good luck.

1352
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,520
We'll try our best to get that clothing back.

1353
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,120
So you can wear it.

1354
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,080
How about we search that cabinet first?

1355
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,720
Check the cabinet. (Check.)

1356
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,520
Box nine, the door is open.

1357
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,720
Patient gown.

1358
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,320
Take it out.

1359
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,840
He even knew to put this thing inside.

1360
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,600
No.

1361
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,320
There's a possibility it happened like this.

1362
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,200
I think this person

1363
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,200
might have been locked up somewhere.

1364
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,240
For example, treating him

1365
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,160
like a mental patient and imprisoning him.

1366
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,840
And he has signs of being tortured

1367
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,640
and chased or beaten.

1368
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,160
That's right.

1369
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,640
So he might have wanted to escape from here.

1370
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,960
And he didn't know where this place was.

1371
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,440
Then he asked, "Where is this?"

1372
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,000
Where is this?

1373
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,040
So pitiful.

1374
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,600
And in the end, he died so tragically.

1375
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,440
That's possible.

1376
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,400
Because he was wearing a patient gown,

1377
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,040
it means

1378
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,320
he was treated as a patient.

1379
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,720
But everyone thought he was just acting.

1380
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,800
So there's this here.

1381
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,640
There's a note.

1382
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,720
It says, "Tell me what... I, I want to..."

1383
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,080
This is just... two scraps of paper.

1384
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,640
Not sure if there's anything else.

1385
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,520
Shake out that pocket.

1386
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,320
Is there anything else inside?

1387
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,800
No, that's it.

1388
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,280
That's all there is.

1389
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:24,720
Here.

1390
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,920
So this person tore these things up.

1391
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,520
And threw them in this trash can.

1392
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,280
Alright, hold onto it for now.

1393
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
There's another one here.

1394
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,160
A barcode? Why?

1395
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,400
Can it still be used? Let me try.

1396
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,840
No, it's gone.

1397
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,560
It's expired.

1398
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,160
It's gone.

1399
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,280
Let's go back to that office building.

1400
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,880
Come on, let's go back.

1401
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,000
This place was already a dangerous building.

1402
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,120
They must have renovated it before.

1403
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,640
They turned it into a training camp.

1404
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,320
Right?

1405
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,120
There was an explosion, so...

1406
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,760
No, it was written on the wall just now.

1407
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
The wall says it's not load-bearing.

1408
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,880
Do not lean on it.

1409
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,520
So even just leaning on it might...

1410
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,280
...make the wall collapse.

1411
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah.

1412
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,240
So just a light hit could...

1413
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,680
Yeah.

1414
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,800
Let's go back to that office building.

1415
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,440
Come on, let's go back.

1416
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,120
Sorry.

1417
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,120
I bumped into something.

1418
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,120
Your rope

1419
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,240
is all dirty.

1420
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,960
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

1421
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,200
Who still remembers when we first came here,

1422
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,360
how confident and impressive we were?

1423
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:22,760
Yeah.

1424
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,720
Now going back,

1425
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,640
we're all messy and disheveled.

1426
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,720
So much for being like "The Heirs."

1427
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,120
Right.

1428
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,680
No,

1429
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,920
you guys were stepping on me for ages just now.

1430
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,280
When those people were chasing us,

1431
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,320
you two kept stepping on me.

1432
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:34,920
I was like this the whole time.

1433
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,000
Constantly being pulled.

1434
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,720
It's okay.

1435
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:43,880
Come on.

1436
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,520
Come.

1437
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,080
Welcome.

1438
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,480
Come on, say something.

1439
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,520
Friends,

1440
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,440
and all suspects,

1441
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,280
Alright, how about this:

1442
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,080
let's take a look at this first.

1443
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,200
Let's see what this thing is.

1444
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,640
Thank you.

1445
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,760
Thanks.

1446
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,560
Hot water.

1447
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,080
A little, yeah.

1448
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,000
It's boiling water.

1449
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,200
It's too hot, babe.

1450
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,320
Art Academy.

1451
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,680
Come here.

1452
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,320
Here's the thing.

1453
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,760
Like this.

1454
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,560
This person wants to go to school now.

1455
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,760
This is Tuizhen Art Academy.

1456
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,560
It's written at the top.

1457
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,240
I was harmed back then.

1458
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,840
Yeah.

1459
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,040
Fell off the cliff at Tiebu Mountain.

1460
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,640
Now life is worse than death.

1461
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,920
I treated you as a friend, but you hurt me.

1462
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,560
I want revenge.

1463
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,040
Tiebu Mountain cliff.

1464
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,000
Isn't that the friend I hit with my car?

1465
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,920
Yeah.

1466
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,600
My friend was also at Tiebu Mountain.

1467
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
So I used this draft, Lidi.

1468
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,440
I tricked my friend into going there.

1469
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,720
He from that mountain

1470
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,800
accidentally rolled down.

1471
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,480
He fell to his death.

1472
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,560
I took my friend Jin up the mountain.

1473
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,360
I said let's go for a drive, have some fun.

1474
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,280
Bang, hit him.

1475
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,520
Then he fell down.

1476
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,280
Pushed down the mountain.

1477
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,880
It was my friend and that

1478
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,800
Ning friend.

1479
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,960
Both of them fell down.

1480
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,240
No.

1481
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,960
Are you two okay?

1482
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Something happened.

1483
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,000
Something happened.

1484
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,200
It hasn't happened yet.

1485
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,080
Not yet.

1486
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
So who is he?

1487
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,840
He used to be a good friend of one of us.

1488
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,120
That's right.

1489
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
He didn't die.

1490
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,560
That's right.

1491
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,680
Maybe he rolled down the mountain and someone found him.

1492
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,040
He was saved.

1493
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
Then he was locked up somewhere.

1494
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,680
That's right.

1495
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,840
So he's not mentally ill.

1496
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,200
He's really just a

1497
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,240
seriously injured patient.

1498
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,800
He escaped from the ICU.

1499
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,200
Why would someone want to kill him?

1500
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,840
It must be one of us.

1501
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,760
Who knows that my friend is still alive.

1502
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,960
After I saw this note,

1503
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,760
I must have wanted to kill him.

1504
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,680
What do you mean?

1505
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,920
If this friend comes back,

1506
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,000
he'll reveal the truth from back then.

1507
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
For example, you were driving.

1508
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,400
Your statement was that you jumped out of the car.

1509
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,200
He was on the verge of falling.

1510
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,560
Or maybe you pushed him out of the car yourself.

1511
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,360
You pushed him out.

1512
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,120
Or you caused the accident on purpose.

1513
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,600
That's right.

1514
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,480
So if he comes back and tells the truth,

1515
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,320
you'll be guilty.

1516
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,440
He wants revenge.

1517
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,440
It's all about fear.

1518
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,240
So, he...

1519
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,200
Who actually knows him is really important.

1520
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,920
It's very important.

1521
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,400
So everyone says

1522
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,480
they don't know him.

1523
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,920
I don't know him.

1524
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm not acquainted with him.

1525
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,240
I don't know him.

1526
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,120
I don't know him either.

1527
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,240
I don't know him.

1528
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,040
Who's lying?

1529
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,640
I'm giving him a chance now.

1530
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,600
If he admits it now,

1531
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,520
we can vote in secret.

1532
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,320
He and I will each get a golden key.

1533
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,800
But if you insist on continuing the game,

1534
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,640
How do we vote in secret?

1535
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,880
And still each get a golden key?

1536
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,360
Because I made the rules.

1537
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,600
If you admit it now,

1538
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,360
Your rules are the rules.

1539
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,400
I'll protect you.

1540
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,320
And then we each get a golden key.

1541
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,280
But if you want to keep playing,

1542
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,360
then it won't be easy to handle.

1543
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,000
I admit it.

1544
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,720
You admit it?

1545
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,840
I said to admit it secretly.

1546
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,400
Sorry, I take it back.

1547
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,120
Next, we'll enter the X confirmation phase.

1548
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,320
Go straight to X.

1549
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,320
It's X already?

1550
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,680
Going straight to X.

1551
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,440
I think you must be X.

1552
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,920
No, she must be X.

1553
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,440
Because I believe, in the eyes of the culprit,

1554
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,720
if they don't choose her as X,

1555
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,640
she's a threat.

1556
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,240
Makes sense.

1557
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,880
Because she's very sharp.

1558
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,680
Are you X?

1559
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,840
I'm not.

1560
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,000
Impossible.

1561
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,920
I really am not.

1562
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,520
It doesn't matter whether you are or not right now.

1563
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,880
We'll just assume you are.

1564
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,400
Understood.

1565
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,000
Alright.

1566
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,640
Alright.

1567
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,080
Let's rest up and try again.

1568
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,360
Okay, see you tomorrow.

1569
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,440
See you tomorrow.

1570
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,080
Goodbye.

1571
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,480
Assistant director.

1572
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,360
How's the investigation going?

1573
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,160
Still investigating.

1574
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:47,920
Thanks for your hard work.

1575
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,760
Thank you for your effort.

1576
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,080
Looking forward to your results.

1577
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,120
I'll head out first.

1578
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,040
Alright.

1579
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,200
A master of logic and eloquence.

1580
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,280
A lucky charm who can find clues anywhere.

1581
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,800
It's like you were born for detective work.

1582
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,880
I need to hurry.

1583
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,160
Share this with my detective partners.

1584
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,880
Multiple character personalities are now available.

1585
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
Enjoy the "Coca-Cola" sharing bottles.

1586
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,920
Let's have fun together and enjoy solving mysteries.

1587
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,200
Hello, everyone.

1588
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,640
Hello, everyone.

1589
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,600
Let's go to yesterday's break room.

1590
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,880
Come on.

1591
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,040
Did everyone sleep well?

1592
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,240
Not bad.

1593
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,880
Alright, let's review.

1594
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,240
The movements of the person with red hair.

1595
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,200
This person

1596
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,040
around eight or nine yesterday morning

1597
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,160
arrived at this place

1598
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,720
On the morning of the 22nd, around eight or nine

1599
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,200
I saw someone

1600
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,360
sneaking around here

1601
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,840
We lost a piece of clothing

1602
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,400
After that, he took his hospital gown

1603
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,480
and hid it in that cabinet

1604
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,880
He went out and started asking for directions

1605
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,800
He asked me about this place

1606
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,480
Wait, let me add a detail here

1607
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,080
He also tore up that flyer

1608
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,080
and threw it in the trash can

1609
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,400
When evening came

1610
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,240
he bit his own right elbow

1611
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,240
It should have been around eight thirty

1612
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,440
He bit his right elbow

1613
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,680
In the end, there was someone

1614
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,800
He seemed to have gone up to the second floor from the back door

1615
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,280
That was when he went up last night

1616
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,400
Then, when he was about to come down

1617
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,640
he died, right?

1618
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,680
That, I don't know

1619
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,120
Was it

1620
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,560
that he died while being lured upstairs

1621
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,240
or after he came up

1622
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,840
and died when he was coming down

1623
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,320
I think

1624
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,560
he died when he went up

1625
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,960
Why?

1626
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,760
He went upstairs

1627
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,560
He rushed upstairs

1628
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,320
Either he was lying in front

1629
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,360
or lying in the back

1630
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,040
Let me give you an example.

1631
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,040
If the ceiling collapses at this moment,

1632
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,760
how would you react?

1633
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,520
For example, if I’m going downstairs,

1634
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,600
I would definitely

1635
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,160
It’s possible, anything could happen.

1636
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,080
You get it, right? You understand this logic?

1637
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,000
That makes sense.

1638
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:44,960
Okay.

1639
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:45,960
Yesterday, we

1640
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,760
later used this flyer to cover it.

1641
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,400
Then we discovered something:

1642
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,600
He’s very likely

1643
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,440
one of our friends.

1644
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,360
Three steel rods

1645
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,320
head, chest, and stomach

1646
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,280
were brutally stabbed into his body.

1647
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,280
Brutally stabbed into his body.

1648
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,240
I’m giving you one last chance now.

1649
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,920
Step forward right now.

1650
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,280
I’m still willing to share the golden key with you.

1651
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,080
If you keep playing,

1652
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,840
it’ll be too late.

1653
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,840
Look at her expression.

1654
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,080
I hate that petty, self-important look the most.

1655
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,880
It’ll be too late.

1656
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,320
It’s too late.

1657
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,040
Why do you always talk like that?

1658
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,760
The pacing of this performance is amazing.

1659
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,480
I have nothing more to say.

1660
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,760
Perfect.

1661
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,120
You have to keep up this state all day today.

1662
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,920
You have to keep up this state all day today.

1663
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,760
You’ll be exhausted.

1664
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,800
Constantly.

1665
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,720
Your blood pressure will go up.

1666
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,200
Yeah, your forehead will be flushed soon.

1667
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,320
Is the person in your car a boy or a girl?

1668
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,920
You don't have the right to ask me. I'm the detective.

1669
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,000
You don't have the right to ask me. I'm the detective.

1670
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,800
Okay.

1671
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,480
In TV dramas like this,

1672
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,560
you'd be the first to die.

1673
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,520
The first one to get killed.

1674
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Let's continue sorting things out.

1675
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,840
At that time, on his body,

1676
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,880
what did we find?

1677
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,200
Who wants to answer?

1678
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,440
Come on, who wants to raise their hand?

1679
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:24,960
Come on.

1680
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,080
You.

1681
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,880
Go ahead.

1682
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,080
What was found on the body?

1683
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,040
What was found on the body?

1684
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,200
Burns. Burns on the hand.

1685
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,600
Right.

1686
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,960
Burns on the hand.

1687
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,440
The sleeve was half torn off.

1688
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,880
It might be related to this.

1689
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,320
Is it related?

1690
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,440
He bit it off himself.

1691
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,000
I don't know.

1692
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,520
It's possible.

1693
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,200
Wait, I'm really curious about something.

1694
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,120
Can a person bite their own elbow?

1695
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,840
Try it.

1696
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,200
You can.

1697
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,800
This is the forearm.

1698
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,760
Elbow.

1699
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,520
Elbow.

1700
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,400
Elbow.

1701
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,320
How long would that tongue have to be? Like a lizard.

1702
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,040
It's like when people say you can lick your own elbow with your tongue.

1703
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,480
That's a special ability.

1704
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,400
So I think he's a remarkable person.

1705
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,080
Maybe his body has mutated.

1706
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,280
Someone with acrobatic abilities.

1707
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,320
If it's a mutation,

1708
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,560
is it related to that assistant director from yesterday

1709
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,400
and the movie he was filming?

1710
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,520
Because the theme of our play

1711
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,600
is set at the end of the world.

1712
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,080
A terrible infection breaks out.

1713
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,840
Those infected turn into monsters.

1714
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,000
Right, monsters and such.

1715
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,560
Because he mentioned something about mutation.

1716
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:34,880
Yeah.

1717
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:36,800
Yeah.

1718
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,200
Yeah.

1719
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,840
There's another piece of evidence.

1720
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,480
We found it yesterday.

1721
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,720
It's that hammer.

1722
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,120
There was a lot of paint on it.

1723
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,520
Paint.

1724
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,680
That's also an important clue.

1725
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,000
This hammer was used to smash

1726
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,760
and collapse that building, right?

1727
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:49,880
Yes.

1728
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,760
The receipt for opening the door.

1729
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,360
There was a hospital gown stored in the locker, right?

1730
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,040
The red-haired guy put it there.

1731
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,560
Normally, this is

1732
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,520
a one-time use.

1733
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,560
He probably scanned locker number nine.

1734
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,360
After opening it,

1735
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,360
he checked what was inside.

1736
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:04,960
After taking it out,

1737
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,240
he changed clothes, stuffed them in, and closed it.

1738
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,160
The receipt was left there.

1739
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,360
No.

1740
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,600
Do you remember that extra from yesterday?

1741
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,080
When that extra gave us the paper,

1742
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,840
he said he was the one who closed the locker, right?

1743
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,080
He said it was open, and then he closed it.

1744
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Tonight,

1745
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,800
out of kindness,

1746
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,840
he saw the locker was open,

1747
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,480
so I closed it.

1748
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,600
So there's a question.

1749
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,760
It's possible the killer

1750
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,440
put it inside.

1751
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:25,560
Put it inside.

1752
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,400
Put his hospital gown

1753
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,360
and the paper in there.

1754
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:27,800
It's possible.

1755
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,920
Because that's also possible.

1756
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,000
The killer could have torn it up.

1757
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:30,960
It's possible.

1758
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,640
Tiebu Mountain is also an important clue.

1759
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,560
Right, because all of our friends

1760
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,720
jumped off the cliff at Tiebu Mountain.

1761
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,480
Jumped off the cliff.

1762
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,600
Their story hasn't come out yet.

1763
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,440
We need to go take a look.

1764
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,160
Famous and Bai.

1765
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,080
Pick one from among them.

1766
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,040
The best among the Bai.

1767
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,240
What's his name?

1768
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:50,720
Prince Charming.

1769
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,840
Prince Charming.

1770
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,200
The best among the Bai.

1771
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,840
Do you think he's not worthy?

1772
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,680
Go search for Prince Charming and Famous.

1773
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:02,720
Let's go.

1774
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,120
Let's go.

1775
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,360
Break room.

1776
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,360
This is locked.

1777
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,000
Let's see, it's an acting challenge card.

1778
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,320
Place the corresponding "Coca-Cola"

1779
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,760
into the slot.

1780
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,200
It can help you open the box.

1781
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:22,800
Okay.

1782
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,840
Acting challenge.

1783
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,400
Come on.

1784
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,480
Four characters.

1785
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,040
Okay.

1786
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,840
Eat.

1787
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,560
Eat melon.

1788
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:30,840
Right.

1789
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,240
Crowd.

1790
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:31,680
Right.

1791
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,840
You're so smart.

1792
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,400
Let me see this one.

1793
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,720
This one is hard too.

1794
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,680
The third character is this one.

1795
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,840
The third character is this—"butt."

1796
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,680
The second-to-last character.

1797
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,160
What kind of "stock" are you?

1798
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,320
I'm a potential stock.

1799
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,080
Right.

1800
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,160
Complete it into a full sentence yourself.

1801
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,080
The onlookers saw a stock called

1802
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,520
"Zhou Keyu" with great potential.

1803
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:58,960
That's good.

1804
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,080
Place the corresponding "Coca-Cola"

1805
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,160
into the slot.

1806
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,360
Take a sip of "Coca-Cola" and feel refreshed and happy.

1807
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,920
Various personalities are now available.

1808
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,440
Have fun with the "Coca-Cola" sharing bottle.

1809
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,360
Let's enjoy together.

1810
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,360
Take a look.

1811
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,000
Whose phone is this?

1812
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,880
It's yours, right?

1813
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,520
Very famous.

1814
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,520
Or did someone else send it to you?

1815
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,840
He friend.

1816
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,680
Is this your girlfriend?

1817
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,120
Is this your girlfriend?

1818
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,200
Take another look.

1819
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:52,600
Take another look.

1820
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,440
Why is this girl's midface so long?

1821
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:55,520
Is she good-looking?

1822
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,560
She's quite pretty.

1823
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,240
This should be his younger sister.

1824
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Because she looks just like him.

1825
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,760
Then he said, "What do you mean?"

1826
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,000
Like, why are you dressed as a girl?

1827
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,840
Then he said, "None of your business."

1828
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,520
You're a cross-dressing pro.

1829
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,760
You're a cross-dressing pro.

1830
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,080
You guys have uncovered a shocking secret.

1831
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,320
For real?

1832
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,800
The talent show star has turned into a comedy star.

1833
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,600
Why is the popular contestant acting like this?

1834
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,400
If it really is you,

1835
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,320
I won't let you go, even if I become a ghost.

1836
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,160
You framed him.

1837
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:34,640
Where did you go?

1838
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,320
I took the wrong phone.

1839
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,200
He thought he was me.

1840
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,880
Your good friend found out about this.

1841
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,640
I will definitely become famous in the future.

1842
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,440
But you're afraid.

1843
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,840
You're timid, you're afraid of being blacklisted.

1844
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,800
Is he questioning you?

1845
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,000
He treats you like a brother.

1846
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,440
No.

1847
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,480
I only found out the next day that my friend fell off the cliff.

1848
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,040
What did your good friend say afterwards?

1849
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,520
What's with the fierce look?

1850
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,120
That was just an accident.

1851
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,000
Behind-the-scenes manipulation.

1852
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,280
So his friend was completely innocent.

1853
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,800
You let your friend take the blame for you.

1854
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,480
Being friends with someone like that...

1855
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,400
Are we locked in?

1856
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,040
Neither the stairs nor the elevator can be accessed.

1857
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,080
Who locked us in?

1858
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,760
Then you’re on your own.

1859
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,600
Go.

1860
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,720
Let's move.

1861
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,040
This elevator can't come down.

1862
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:11,800
The elevator is here.

1863
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,720
The elevator is here.

1864
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,560
This is the real them.

1865
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,160
There's someone here.

1866
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,000
Keep your voice down.

1867
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,680
Someone's coming up.

1868
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,160
Someone's coming up.

1869
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,920
Go to the rooftop.

1870
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,080
Is there any emergency escape equipment in here?

1871
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,120
We're doomed.

1872
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,760
I don't dare.

1873
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,200
Vertical descent.

1874
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,000
Wait a second.

1875
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,240
If this really happens,

1876
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,960
I think I'd still be a little scared.

1877
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,400
Aba.

1878
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,680
A Jin.

1879
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,760
No, I already feel like crying, what should I do?
