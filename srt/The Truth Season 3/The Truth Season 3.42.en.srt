1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,040
In Tui City, Tui Tu Village,

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,560
stands the old Gu De mansion.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,840
This old house

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
has nurtured a family of calligraphers and painters for a hundred years.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
The Gu De family

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,200
is also known for

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,200
the eerie legend: "Human blood enters the painting, the painting devours the living."

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,720
A strange and sinister rumor.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,400
This house is not clean.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,480
It seems you can see the dead here.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,640
On May 8th, the Gu De family gathered together.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
They celebrated the 60th birthday of the family head, Gu De Moning.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Everyone was present.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,520
Gu De Moning's father, the elder Gu De,

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,400
presented his son with a family heirloom painting from the ancestral home.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,720
presented his son with a family heirloom painting from the ancestral home.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:05,760
presented his son with a family heirloom painting from the ancestral home.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
He also presided over the family's traditional

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,800
kin-calling ceremony.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
After the ceremony, the elder Gu De disappeared.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,080
After the ceremony, the elder Gu De disappeared.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Everyone discovered

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,440
that the missing elder Gu De

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,360
had mysteriously appeared in the painting.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720
had mysteriously appeared in the painting.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:20,800
had mysteriously appeared in the painting.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,040
Bound by blood,

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,800
when drops of blood soak into the painting,

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
the mystery of the Gu De mansion is about to be revealed.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
the mystery of the Gu De mansion is about to be revealed.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,120
After a preliminary investigation,

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,960
the people involved in this case have been identified.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,320
I am a detective.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
I am also a detective.

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Who is the beneficiary?

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,920
You already know, don't you?

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,880
Then say it yourself.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,560
Go on.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,920
What's going on with you two?

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,520
Be honest and you'll get leniency.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,480
As his son,

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,120
how did you take care of the old man?

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,360
Where's the key?

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,880
Look for it.

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,200
You're really good at shifting the blame.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,480
Weren't you the one who stole it?

47
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,080
Stealing? You even stole someone else's things.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
And you,

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
The old man was heading your way.

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
Breaking ties cleanly.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,760
You've gone bad now, I'm telling you.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
Those two troublemakers—do you really trust them?

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,920
You two are just turning on each other.

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,240
He didn't turn on you, he's just targeting you.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
Let's search the crime scene first.

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,160
See if there's any suspicious evidence.

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,160
There are so many paintings here.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
I just suddenly thought of something.

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
It's about what we just mentioned.

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,640
This is the point.

61
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Who can operate in the dark?

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
Did you forget what her profession is?

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,000
Dream person

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
You should show off a bit too.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,640
He’s stolen all the spotlight.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
You’re the eldest legitimate grandson.

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,280
This...

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,160
Say something.

69
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,520
You’re going against me because of her.

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,480
Is there something between you and her?

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,160
If the moon hasn’t arrived yet,

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,280
If it’s the windowsill,

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,840
No, I don’t believe it.

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
I think whoever can discover it

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
is also important, right?

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
That’s right.

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
So the culprit has been here.

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
He’s seen this, he knows where he is.

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
I think what you said is correct.

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
As long as the culprit can find a way

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,880
to the location,

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,520
that’s enough.

83
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,760
Yes.

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,280
I think from

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,920
this perspective,

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,560
you’re the most suspicious.

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
Because you’re the butler.

88
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
You’re very familiar with the layout here.

89
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
You’d know it very well.

90
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,400
He might have tampered with something.

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Because he’s always with the master.

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,720
I... just

93
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,040
embezzled the great-grandfather’s property.

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,320
I can’t accept it.

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,640
He took care of you, but you still don’t acknowledge him.

96
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,560
So what?

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,680
So you took your anger out on

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
You shut up first.

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,880
and just threw him away.

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
Shut up.

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
What do you mean, don't you understand?

102
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm speechless.

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,640
No, you can't.

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,240
Because you think it's me.

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
Won. Victory.

106
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Victory.

107
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600
So if we compare,

108
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,880
I think he's probably the least suspicious.

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,280
Makes sense.

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,840
The previous one works too.

111
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,360
That works too.

112
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I must have been excluded.

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,840
Because I'm the hardest.

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
It's you and another one.

115
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,040
Conversation.

116
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,720
The key point is us.

117
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
Insolent.

118
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,360
Don't forget your place, son.

119
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,280
You dare to criticize your father at a time like this?

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm the investigator.

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,760
You're the most suspicious.

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm the most suspicious?

123
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,400
Defying your superior, daring to go against me.

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
Now you're turning on the investigator.

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
Even if you were the emperor himself,

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,240
you're still my son.

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,840
You, woman.

128
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Because you're my son.

129
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,400
It's normal that our eyes look the same.

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
Unwilling to accept it.

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
I think this pastry is suspicious.

132
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Let me try it.

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
It's pretty good. I had one.

134
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,840
Wait, there's a water stain here.

135
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,320
A water stain.

136
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
Someone must have been so scared they peed themselves just now.

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
Who was it?

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,760
Three of them?

139
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,960
Three of them?

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,960
That's right.

141
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
It has to be

142
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,680
Da Ningzi.

143
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,280
For example,

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
this is a painting.

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
I already set up the bottom in advance.

146
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,120
After that,

147
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
doesn't it just, you know,

148
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,360
come out?

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,600
Then it's the two of you.

150
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
It started from

151
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,840
Please, it's my first time here.

152
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,920
You're already here.

153
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
It's not for nothing, right?

154
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Why don't you two go as a couple?

155
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,800
It seems like there's no one behind.

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
Why should I believe you?

157
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,200
They're faking it.

158
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,880
Impossible.

159
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,800
Who could make that kind of sound?

160
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,440
No one.

161
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,920
I really want to go home.

162
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
This is your stepmother.

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Stepmother, I admit it.

164
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
Stepmother.

165
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
Above the moon.

166
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,880
Yue, you peeked at someone bathing.

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
You shouldn't have.

168
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,560
You're the one who was inappropriate.

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,880
Besides, he's my son.

170
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm just concerned about my son's health.

171
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Fake son.

172
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,760
What's wrong?

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
Stop telling the master about this.

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,320
Do you really believe what those marketing accounts write?

175
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
Hurry up.

176
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,160
Ask, ask your eldest uncle.

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Did I lose my memory?

178
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,400
Eldest uncle.

179
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Eldest uncle.

180
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,600
You also have a younger uncle.

181
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,320
Only you are...

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
...family.

183
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,120
A clean break.

184
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
That makes you even more suspicious.

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
You...

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,480
I find it very hard to accept this fact.

187
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,080
Whenever he wants to be with someone, he just...

188
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
How many people are there, really?

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
What kind of relationship?

190
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,520
Is it the old master?

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
Passed away.

192
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
Anyway, he has to...

193
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
...before he can be killed.

194
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
It's hard to say, really hard to say.

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,200
No way, family?

196
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,960
This...

197
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
It's already come to this?

198
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,680
Whenever you're unsure...

199
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,400
Quick!

200
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,920
Press my philtrum for me!

201
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,440
Quick-acting heart pills!

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
You're just a dog washer.

203
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Dog washer.

204
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,160
Why do you look down on people like that?

205
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Why do I feel like you all...

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
There's nothing shameful about washing dogs.

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
You're a proper dog washer.

208
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,840
No, it's your tone...

209
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Your tone is so condescending.

210
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
You not only lifted his blanket,

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,880
you even secretly took photos of him.

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm speechless.

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,080
If the old master was moved after bleeding,

214
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,000
there would definitely be bloodstains left behind.

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Right.

216
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,600
Two people's names

217
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Good something something

218
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
Good something something

219
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,360
So that is very likely

220
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,520
not the master's blood

221
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Then I'll bring up a new one

222
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,160
Is that okay?

223
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,880
After it starts

224
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,040
we must switch

225
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,440
Otherwise, how can we switch like this?

226
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,720
The logic is the same

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Right

228
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Yes

229
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
Everyone was tagged

230
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Is that right?

231
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,560
Yes

232
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
If it's everyone

233
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,360
who needs to be tagged

234
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
in that case

235
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,680
When the lights were out this morning

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,240
we left

237
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,920
I think the master might have

238
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,360
died at

239
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,280
that time

240
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,320
Can I go first?

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Sure

242
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay, timer starts

243
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,920
Is that enough?

244
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,480
We need eight orange ones

245
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Eight orange ones

246
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
You shook all of them out

247
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Impressive

248
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,520
Congratulations, you completed the challenge

249
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,440
How much time is left?

250
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,440
There's one left

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
Someone help

252
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,280
I want to eat sunflower seeds

253
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,960
All the jewels and ornaments have fallen

254
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,720
That hurts

255
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,960
Congratulations on completing the challenge

256
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Bai Yu

257
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,800
So you can have some sunflower seeds,

258
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
I did my best.

259
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,720
Alright, here we go.

260
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Three, two, one.

261
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,480
Is it really this hard?

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,480
Doing this much so early in the morning,

263
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
such intense (exercise).

264
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,920
Is that enough?

265
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,960
Did it work?

266
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,920
Just one more left.

267
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,400
Time's up.

268
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
Unfortunately,

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
the challenge failed.

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
That's too bad.

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
How many do you think you can shake out?

272
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,960
I can't shake out even one.

273
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
Is the position wrong?

274
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,640
Can it be placed in the front?

275
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
Can I put it in the front?

276
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,200
Okay, you can.

277
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
This is easy.

278
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,240
There's one more.

279
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,840
Come out.

280
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,360
Come out.

281
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,160
It came out.

282
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
How many do you think you can shake out?

283
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,720
I think I can shake them all out.

284
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:52,920
Go ahead.

285
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,960
One, two, three, four.

286
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,760
One, two, three.

287
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Done.

288
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,840
There's one more.

289
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,520
Shaking made my stomach hurt.

290
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,280
Where is it?

291
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

292
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,800
My stomach hurts.

293
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Wait, let me rest for a bit.

294
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,520
It came out.

295
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,400
It didn't take more than a minute, right?

296
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,440
That's fine.

297
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,200
Three, two, one.

298
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,760
Challenge completed.

299
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,320
Is that all?

300
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Yes, that's all.

301
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,920
Alright, congratulations.

302
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,520
Nice and simple.

303
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,440
We recommend for you

304
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
spicy snacks

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,160
and an energy nut platter.

306
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
I have a small folding stool.

307
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm drooling.

308
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
Jiangxi stir-fry, stir-fry, stir-fry.

309
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,640
Should I ask

310
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,080
what they all ordered?

311
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
Dessert.

312
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
Claypot rice.

Hawthorn fruit leather.

316
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,040
Nuts.

317
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,640
Let's just go to this snack shop.

318
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,120
Large nut platter.

319
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,280
Nut platter, right?

320
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
Yes.

321
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,480
One is the props room.

322
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
Which one do you want to choose?

323
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
Say it again.

324
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,760
One is the tempting snack shop.

325
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,240
One is the delicious cafeteria.

326
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,840
One is the interesting props room.

327
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
Which one do you want to choose?

328
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The snack shop.

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,880
Okay.

330
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
Then you can only choose from the snack shop.

331
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,240
One item.

332
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Crunchy snack gift pack.

333
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,200

Big platter.

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
I want one.

339
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,280
Hawthorn roll.

340
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
Okay.

341
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,600
The menu has changed.

342
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,200
The second one.

343
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm drooling.

344
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,840
Jiangxi stir-fry.

345
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,720
I have a lot of courage, right?

346
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,680
This thing is called "Hao Da Dan."

347
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,720
I have "Hao Da Dan."
