1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,640
What does this mean?

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,920
Are we still playing games?

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,800
Let's eat.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
It's like the last supper.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,840
Hurry up and get me something to eat.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,240
Chicken.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
The ginger flavor is a bit strong.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,920
I want to eat ginger.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,840
There's ginger here.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
If you want to eat ginger,

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,520
Yes.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,280
Then you should have that big plate of chicken.

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,840
Or maybe ginger cola or something.

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,120
Would you just eat ginger by itself?

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,560
You really like it, huh?

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,439
Dried shrimp with lotus root.

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,360
That's mine.

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,000
You said it was good yesterday.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
This is super tasty.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,520
There's one here that hasn't been opened.

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,680
Noodles, do you want some?

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,440
I'll mix it up.

23
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,080
What do you want to eat?

24
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,200
I can skip eating.

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
Can I take a bit of cucumber?

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,240
Go ahead.

27
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,320
Just pour some into that bowl.

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,920
Just pour it over, that's fine.

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,520
What's this?

30
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,760
Beef.

31
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,120
Tasty.

32
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,200
Oh no, my voice is even more hoarse.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
It wasn't hoarse at all during the debate just now.

34
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,000
I was just wondering how it suddenly got better.

35
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,480
The two of them.

36
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,440
I think there's one issue.

37
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
We still haven't forgotten our original intention.

38
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,840
Back in the first season,

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
it was me and my sister arguing.

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
And by the last episode, it's still the two of us here.

41
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,200
We haven't grown, just stuck to our original selves.

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,160
That's great.

43
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,000
Only this way,

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
since our growth arc isn't finished,

45
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,520
there can be a fourth season.

46
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,720
Bro.

47
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,320
That's right, yes.

48
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,720
Isn't that so?

49
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,320
This time, we'll be awesome.

50
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,560
Who's coming back for season four?

51
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Of course.

52
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,520
Yes.

53
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,400
To keep our spot on the show,

54
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
so for this program,

55
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
we can keep doing it for a hundred years.

56
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,440
We'll keep doing it for a hundred years.

57
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,800
The foolish and clueless siblings.

58
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,200
Bro, seriously, being on this show makes me reflect.

59
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,480
It really does.

60
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Because the two of us are

61
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
the type who get super hyped on shows.

62
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Haven't you noticed?

63
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
It's important.

64
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,880
Right or wrong really doesn't matter.

65
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,920
It doesn't matter?

66
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,560
After I finished recording the second episode,

67
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,120
I felt it didn't matter.

68
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,600
I care a lot about the process.

69
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,920
I don't care about the result at all.

70
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
Even if I can't guess it, it really doesn't matter to me.

71
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,680
I've let it go.

72
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
Yeah, my director told me,

73
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,960
He said Ning didn't win today.

74
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
At the time, I said it's fine.

75
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,200
I told him it's no big deal.

76
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,320
I don't mind.

77
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Just like that, like that day with you.

78
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,039
That day, the two of us.

79
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,240
Even the day before, when I was the culprit.

80
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
Actually, I think

81
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,360
I've found my own comfort zone.

82
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720
We should find those two first.

83
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,920
Come on, let's go.

84
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
So, what should it be?

85
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,120
It can be opened.

86
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Pulled open.

87
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,840
Need to climb.

88
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll go block that camera for you.

89
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
Can you move it for me?

90
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,880
Moving the chair won't help.

91
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll get you a chair.

92
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
The chair won't help, it's too tall.

93
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
But I'll go get a chair anyway.

94
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,320
Why do you need a chair?

95
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
The chair isn't that tall.

96
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,120
So you can step on the chair first.

97
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm worried about your skirt.

98
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
This.

99
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,880
You're so smart.

100
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,640
Slow down.

101
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't want to be the fool anymore.

102
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920
Just twist it and it'll come right out.

103
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,720
Don't bump your head.

104
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
There's an umbrella.

105
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
Here's an umbrella. Thanks.

106
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,720
Here.

107
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Thank you.

108
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's go.

109
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Is it easy to walk?

110
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,040
Not really.

111
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,280
Here, boss, after you.

112
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,480
Hello, everyone.

113
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,800
No tasks today?

114
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,560
Aren't we, as the leaders, supposed to have something planned?

115
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm telling you, the twist is on their side.

116
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
The two of us, later on...

117
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,240
...will probably get "eliminated" by them.

118
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,720
For sure.

119
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah.

120
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
We'll eat soon, so just eat a little for now.

121
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
You finished a whole bowl and you call that eating a little?

122
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,440
No, I haven't finished yet.

123
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
See, there's still some left around the edge.

124
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,240
Alright, just eat a little.

125
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,720
What do you mean? Did we win today or not?

126
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,960
We got the golden key.

127
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Really? We won again?

128
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,160
But the friendship is gone.

129
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,160
Doesn't matter, the golden key is what counts.

130
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
You all look very happy.

131
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
Would you like something to eat?

132
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay.

133
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,640
Yes.

134
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Very good, sure.

135
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,040
Alright.

136
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Hello.

137
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,200
What just happened in there?

138
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,240
What happened?

139
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,520
You don't even know who you're working so hard for.

140
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
And then you look at someone else.

141
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Doing things for good people.

142
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,560
I'll give you two golden keys.

143
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
Then I forgive you.

144
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,600
Then you've cheered me up.

145
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
Where are we going to eat?

146
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,399
Let's eat something.

147
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,519
How should we sit?

148
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Someone will bring out a table.

149
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay.

150
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,200
What does this mean?

151
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,120
Are we still playing games?

152
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
No, we're eating.

153
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
It's the last supper.

154
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,080
Hurry up and get me something to eat.

155
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Ning.

156
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,920
No matter what that She just did to you,

157
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,280
it has nothing to do with me.

158
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
He is She.

159
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
He’s not me.

160
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
Got it.

161
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,280
Because I couldn’t find She,

162
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,680
I’m putting it on you for now.

163
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,960
Bai.

164
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Bai, you’re back.

165
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,360
I’m back.

166
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
Have a seat.

167
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
Sit down, the two of us just had a bowl.

168
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Sit in the middle.

169
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Sit.

170
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,440
Sit.

171
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,240
Sit, come on.

172
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,720
Can we sit anywhere? Then where should I go?

173
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
I’ll sit here.

174
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,760
You guys sit in the middle.

175
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
Those who haven’t eaten, sit over there.

176
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
Sit in the middle, yes.

177
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
Ning is already angry.

178
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,320
He’s really mad.

179
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,480
It’s not anger.

180
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,280
It’s sadness.

181
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,600
This is more serious than being angry.

182
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Yes.

183
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
Being angry isn’t important.

184
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,120
Anger can go away.

185
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
But sadness is hard to fix.

186
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Yes.

187
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,480
Sadness can heal the heart.

188
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
It means to mend your heart.

189
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,320
My Ning is so wise and brave.

190
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Chicken

191
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,240
The ginger flavor is a bit strong.

192
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
I want to eat ginger.

193
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,280
You want to eat ginger.

194
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
I want to eat that ginger.

195
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
This is ginger, right?

196
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,880
Yes, it should be.

197
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
This isn't ginger, it's pickled mustard.

198
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
No, there's ginger here.

199
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,600
If you want to eat ginger,

200
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes.

201
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,360
There’s a lot here.

202
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,680
Thank you.

203
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,160
Then when you eat that big plate chicken,

204
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
or something like ginger cola,

205
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
do you also only eat the ginger?

206
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,440
You really like it, huh?

207
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
Can you share the rice with them?

208
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,960
I know.

209
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
Rice.

210
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Thank you.

211
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,880
Do you want some rice?

212
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
There's one here that hasn't been opened.

213
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
Do you want some noodles?

214
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,400
I'll mix it up.

215
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
Are these noodles with beef?

216
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,240
What kind of meat is in these noodles?

217
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,800
Chicken.

218
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I won this the other day.

219
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
It's a local noodle dish.

220
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,800
What do you want to eat?

221
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
I don't have to eat.

222
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Have some rice.

223
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,400
No, I just ate.

224
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,960
Want some?

225
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,800
No.

226
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,080
I think what's in her bowl

227
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,000
looks really nice.

228
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
I'll scoop some of hers later.

229
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
I feel like hers looks really tasty.

230
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,200
Dried shrimp with lotus root.

231
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,400
That's mine.

232
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
You said it was good yesterday.

233
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
This is super tasty.

234
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Bro.

235
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh no, my voice is even more hoarse.

236
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
It wasn't hoarse at all during the debate just now.

237
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,280
I was just wondering how it suddenly got better.

238
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,320
Do you know the phrase "a final burst of energy before the end"?

239
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,840
That's what it means.

240
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,520
What's this?

241
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Beef.

242
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Delicious.

243
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Can I scrape off some cucumber?

244
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,200
Scrape.

245
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,120
Just pour some directly into that bowl.

246
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
Just pour it over, that's fine.

247
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay, thank you.

248
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
Bro, I really want to ask you something.

249
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,560
In the future, in our lives,

250
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
will we ever have all our money cheated away by others?

251
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,640
No.

252
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,400
Really?

253
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
You're the type who would take money from others.

254
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
I used to think I was that type too.

255
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,920
But now I feel like I can't take money from others.

256
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,680
If I played this kind of game before,

257
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,360
or participated in this kind of show,

258
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,520
I honestly wouldn't care about winning or losing.

259
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,200
Because you don't have any feelings for these people.

260
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,880
No expectations, no trust.

261
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
That's true.

262
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,720
For example,

263
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,600
if I were just a guest for one episode,

264
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
and I didn't know any of these people well,

265
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,440
whether I tricked them or they tricked me,

266
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,280
it wouldn't matter.

267
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,400
But among these people,

268
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,880
we've already become

269
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
important friends to each other.

270
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,920
Really.

271
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
If the moment comes when they deceive you,

272
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,760
you'll feel, for a moment,

273
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,200
that you can't handle it.

274
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,960
Really.

275
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
And you'll realize

276
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
it hurts even more.

277
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,160
You know?

278
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,640
What if our big brother's heart gets hurt?

279
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,080
What should we do?

280
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,440
I thought

281
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,559
that was the closest I'd ever been to winning.

282
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,799
I didn't expect

283
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,960
isn't it like that every time?

284
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
Why is it like this?

285
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,760
I really will ask about it after the show ends.

286
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,920
When they see the two of us like this,

287
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,720
do they want to laugh?

288
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm okay. I'm really fine today.

289
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,520
Because later on, I already...

290
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Because I saw your energy was just off the charts.

291
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
So I just let myself relax.

292
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Let me give an example.

293
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,840
For example, if the culprit is like this...

294
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,480
The most entertaining way for the culprit is

295
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,120
because the two of us are charging ahead.

296
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,880
No matter what, it's just...

297
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,840
If the two of us are on the good guys' team,

298
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,880
we'll definitely end up arguing.

299
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,800
It's hard for us to be on the same side.

300
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
There's nothing we can do, that's just how we are.

301
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,800
So this show is just...

302
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
This is what you call real chemistry.

303
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
We're the "laugh effect."

304
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm the "laugh," you're the "effect."

305
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,280
No.

306
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,320
A bitter result is still a result, I'm telling you.

307
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Those two...

308
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
They're falling back into the first episode's

309
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,520
anxiety again.

310
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,280
Because I really...

311
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
It's easy for me to go all out like you do.

312
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
You and I are so similar in our energy.

313
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
Once I decide on something,

314
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
it doesn't matter what anyone else says.

315
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
Everyone has to listen to me.

316
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
When I get excited, that's how I am.

317
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,280
I also get intense very easily.

318
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,600
Yeah, when you play the bad guy,

319
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
you really go all out as the bad guy.

320
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,200
Look at yourself.

321
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
You did nothing.

322
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
You just sat there and said nothing.

323
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, I have a problem. I'm guilty.

324
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
You don't have a problem.

325
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
It's me, I was too intense.

326
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,680
But I was really scared.

327
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,560
At that time, you had the two of us go together.

328
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
Go up with someone.

329
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,000
So I just said,

330
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
it should have been the three of you from the start.

331
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,840
Yes, that's what I was afraid of.

332
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,080
If the three of us went,

333
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,560
and then your three went right after,

334
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,640
and all three of you are good people,

335
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,520
then that's it, we're done for.

336
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
These two people...

337
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,760
He was also in the last episode of the previous season.

338
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,200
No.

339
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
No, it was the culprit.

340
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,920
Yes, it was him too.

341
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
This season, it's him again.

342
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,160
At that time,

343
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,520
someone definitely pushed Liu Yuning to go up.

344
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
And he was really anxious too.

345
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
Yes, he wanted to go up as well.

346
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
I think I also had a problem.

347
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
It's nothing, whether there's a problem or not.

348
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
I started to focus on Ke

349
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,560
and the two good people.

350
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,920
What's the reason?

351
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,840
Because at that time,

352
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
when we were putting that thing together,

353
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
So at that time

354
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,120
you two started causing trouble, right?

355
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,360
We actually weren't causing trouble back then.

356
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,400
The two of us really didn't cause any trouble.

357
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,880
You all were up front at that time.

358
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,480
The two of us

359
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
We couldn't do anything.

360
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,400
We were just standing there.

361
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,040
As soon as you moved forward,

362
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,840
the two of us just ended up lying there.

363
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,920
We could only move back.

364
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,360
Just being ourselves is considered causing trouble.

365
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
At that moment, it was She who did the good deed.

366
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
It wasn't you two who did the good deed.

367
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
Why does She have to take the blame for the bad things

368
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
while you two get credit for the good things?

369
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
You two act like you've suffered so much.

370
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,960
No, it's because She possessed us.

371
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Right.

372
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,720
We unwillingly got two golden keys.

373
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,160
Yeah.

374
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
Unwillingly.

375
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,760
Give them to me, then.

376
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
You two already got the keys.

377
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,760
We haven't gotten them yet.

378
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,240
But it'll be recorded.

379
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,760
Just imagine it.

380
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,640
You're already keeping track, aren't you?

381
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,240
The two of us said,

382
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
we felt guilty as soon as we got out.

383
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
But we were feeling guilty while still keeping score.

384
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,200
And then we got another one.

385
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,960
So you found out last night

386
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,800
that you were

387
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,280
No

388
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,240
Today, when burning that

389
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,720
burning the paper figure

390
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,320
When burning the paper figure

391
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
I entered that room

392
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,040
and he told you

393
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
to touch the heart

394
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,560
There were two notes inside its heart

395
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,280
saying you are She

396
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Then I became She

397
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Are you happy, Bai Yu?

398
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
Not happy at all

399
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
Why?

400
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
I actually feel a bit lost

401
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,680
Very lost

402
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah

403
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Yeah, do you know that feeling of emptiness?

404
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
Really?

405
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
You've become invincible and lonely

406
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
It's not about being invincible and lonely

407
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,400
It's like winning the world

408
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,120
and turning back to find no one behind you

409
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,640
He really is in first place.

410
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm not first.

411
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,680
He's first.

412
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
Do both of them have five keys?

413
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
No, only he has five.

414
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
Bai has four now, right?

415
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,800
Bai has four.

416
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,560
I have four.

417
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,240
Then you have five today.

418
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,280
Okay, I'm third.

419
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm still second, right?

420
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,520
Am I second now?

421
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Bro, you might be fourth now.

422
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,760
Why?

423
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
Because I might become third.

424
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,640
Did neither Ba nor I change?

425
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,320
No change for either of you.

426
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
No change, because first place didn't change.

427
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,240
Because first place didn't change.

428
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
If first place goes up by one,

429
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,520
it's just that second place moved up one spot.

430
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,240
Second place's rank doesn't change.

431
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
But there's one more key.

432
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
No, second place became first.

433
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
First place is still first.

434
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,600
There are two tied for first.

435
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
My rank didn't change.

436
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,600
So what are we doing next?

437
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
Eat, then you can leave.

438
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,160
Right.

439
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,800
And then we'll never see each other again.

440
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,480
This is delicious.

441
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,640
What's delicious?

442
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
This chicken.

443
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Brother, I'm here.

444
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
You're here too.

445
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,320
I thought only my brother was here.

446
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Brother, have some peanuts.

447
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,160
Don't share with him.

448
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,760
Just the two of us will eat.

449
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,160
I thought you were calling me brother.

450
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,560
You don't act like a big brother.

451
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,320
From now on, I'll call you...

452
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,760
From now on, I'll call you...

453
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,760
Um...

454
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
No, from now on, just call me "Speechless."

455
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay?

456
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
Call me "Speechless," okay?

457
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,600
Seriously, your little brother is twelve years younger than you.

458
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
You even want to trick a twelve-year-old kid.

459
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,120
You now...

460
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,800
No, I don't.

461
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,600
No, I wouldn't.

462
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,560
Do you even have a conscience?

463
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,240
Yeah.

464
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,480
I didn't lie to him.

465
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,680
You two are the ones who tricked him.

466
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,440
It's just a game, it's fine.

467
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
We just...

468
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,920
just like to criticize him, that's all.

469
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Alright, that's true.

470
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,320
He does deserve to be criticized.

471
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,840
He deserves it.

472
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Yeah.

473
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
He told me...

474
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,200
He said there would be another chance soon.

475
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,360
A chance to get the golden key.

476
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Then he said he'd help us later.

477
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Really? Who?

478
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,720
Bro, you can't trust him anymore, bro.

479
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,440
Last time he said...

480
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,000
The first time he tricked you.

481
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,360
He said no matter who you voted for the next day,

482
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,240
he'd vote for the same person as you.

483
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Do you remember that time?

484
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,360
Yeah.

485
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,720
But didn't he go against you the next day?

486
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,040
Or did he still vote for you?

487
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
But I still believe that...

488
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,520
everyone has a day when they turn over a new leaf.

489
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah.

490
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,120
People can change, right?

491
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
A prodigal returns.

492
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,240
You're too kind.

493
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,200
Actually, he...

494
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,920
You know,

495
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,480
if you look at it this way, he does care a lot.

496
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,520
Right?

497
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,720
I think you guys are all the same.

498
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,280
None of you can talk about the others.

499
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,440
These peanuts are delicious, so salty.

500
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
Ryukakusan, right.

501
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,120
When you record later, keep one in your mouth.

502
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Yeah, for your throat.

503
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,920
I use Ryukakusan too.

504
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,800
Is it this one?

505
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,160
Yes, this one. It's the most effective.

506
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,600
It really works.

507
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
Whenever my voice gets hoarse,

508
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
I take this before singing and it gets better right away.

509
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Hold two in your mouth, just like candy.

510
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay.

511
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Bai, can you help me wipe my pants?

512
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Where?

513
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,480
In the back.

514
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,640
Okay.

515
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,040
Alright.

516
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,240
Try this fish, it's really good.

517
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
This fish is really delicious.

518
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
You're starting to want to relax a bit.

519
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,200
Eat as much as you want.

520
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,200
We're having a meal here.

521
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Right?

522
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,960
Which viewer requested this?

523
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,560
It's been fulfilled.

524
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,480
That's a huge steamed bun.

525
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
Give me some, can you break off a piece for me?

526
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,840
Do you eat steamed bread?

527
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,600
Give me half, please.

528
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Here you go, just right.

529
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
What's this?

530
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,960
Potato.

531
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,360
Chicken stewed with mushrooms.

532
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
That's a northeastern dish, that is.

533
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,320
Thank you.

534
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,280
You're serving me rice.

535
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
What did you think?

536
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,960
Thank you.

537
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,440
Thank you.

538
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,160
Thank you, thank you to all the brothers.

539
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,760
What are you laughing at?

540
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
I think she's funny.

541
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,640
I already...

542
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
For half of this year,

543
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
I was just playing at home every day.

544
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
I thought you were at home playing with wire rigs.

545
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
I can't control my impatience with him.

546
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,800
It's okay.

547
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
No matter how you treat me,

548
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
I still love you very much.

549
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,960
Sometimes after we finish work,

550
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
he'll talk to us in the group chat.

551
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,360
That's when he can't let go.

552
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,880
He really cares.

553
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,520
He pretends not to care.

554
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
Of course I care.

555
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
It's okay if I made the wrong choice.

556
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
But I

557
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,320
was too subjective and influenced the people around me.

558
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,880
He won't blame himself.

559
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
He loves himself a lot.

560
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,920
At a certain moment, you all made me feel

561
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,440
like I actually had a heart.

562
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm about to cry.

563
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,400
Really.

564
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,440
I thought you brought a little stool over.

565
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
Turns out you were sitting on this.

566
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,200
It fits just right.

567
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,800
What is this?

568
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,599
Chicken soup.

569
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,200
Drink more of this.

570
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,359
Get some nutrition.
