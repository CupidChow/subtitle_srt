1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,040
The live killing broadcast is about to begin.

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
The live killing broadcast is about to begin.

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,800
Live killing broadcast

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Hand

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
Let me go

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,040
Ke Ankan

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,880
About to drown

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
He wants to watch us die one by one

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Yes

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,040
Bafentang Bai Huanzi

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,640
Heniba

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,680
Jin Tangshao

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,600
About to be crushed by the wall

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,200
You’re not dead

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,880
Accomplice list

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,960
Bai Huanzi

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Bai Huanzi

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,000
You are the bait

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
Heniba is the gambler

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,600
Ke Ankan is

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,240
an evildoer

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,760
You are the only one on the accomplice list

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,120
The Little Frog's Song

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,360
Who are you, really? Tell me.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,160
Who are you?

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Pick it up.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,040
Hello?

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,280
Hello, hi.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,680
Hi.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,160
This is the Tuishi Leather Factory Clearance Center.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,840
Congratulations, you are our lucky customer.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,160
Our factory is holding a big sale as we transition.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,200
No, his ringtone is the little frog.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Did you hear it?

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's see what's here.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,280
Boss, the money has been received.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,160
We're waiting for your instructions.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,200
There's a new development, we need to talk.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,960
Is that Tui Youfu's voice?

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
There's one more.

43
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,680
Work report for the boss.

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
Reported by Tan Qian.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,960
So Tan Qian isn't really our boss.

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
He's just a puppet boss.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
An Wenzhe is the investor.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
Tan Qian is just a manager.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,720
Okay, next is—

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,560
This is his.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,320
Regular area tip monitoring record.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Frog Dad has the highest traffic.

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
But he's dead.

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
The boss has already ordered him to be dealt with.

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,640
What is Frog Dad?

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,520
I want to ask you something.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Why is there a frog on your phone case?

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,040
Who are you, really? Tell me.

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,840
Who are you?

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,560
Who are you?

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,440
Me?

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm the frog's dad.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm the frog's dad.

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,280
You are...

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
the frog.

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Dad.

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,080
What?

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm the frog's dad.

70
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,240
TOP1 is back from the dead.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,680
Now upgraded and in limited live broadcast.

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,880
Little Frog is my daughter.

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Your daughter is dead.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
I don't know if she's dead or not.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
She's in your room.

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
I just heard she fell from a building at his construction site.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
From the scaffolding next to me,

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a woman fell down.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
That was Little Frog.

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
In your memory, she disappeared.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,400
Yes.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,600
And then?

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,240
I have a daughter.

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,280
She got sick when she was fourteen.

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,440
She needed a lot of money for life-saving treatment.

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
But my means were limited.

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,240
I didn't have that much money.

88
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,720
I posted all kinds of messages online.

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,120
Hoping people would help me.

90
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
But no one came to help.

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,560
But a company noticed this situation.

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,600
An MCN company.

93
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,920
Then they contacted me and said,

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,320
"We can use your daughter's illness,

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
and the fact that you're a single father,

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
to gain sympathy,

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,440
and create hype."

98
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,440
They also said they'd set up a livestream room for me.

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,440
"You can get a lot of donations this way."

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,000
"You'll make money."

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,680
I thought about it and realized I had no other choice.

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes.

103
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
So I went.

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,040
After I got there,

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
I wore this frog costume.

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,720
For every donation I receive in the livestream, I'll run that many laps.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
Gradually, I realized

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,560
there are many people in the livestream room

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
who are also, in their own lives,

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
facing all kinds of difficulties.

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,400
I keep encouraging them,

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,040
but at the same time,

113
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
the energy they give me

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
also helps me encourage myself.

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,480
With my daughter,

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,320
back in June,

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I was about to start a livestream,

118
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
but my daughter's medicine suddenly ran out.

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,120
So I had to go to the hospital.

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
After buying the medicine, on my way home,

121
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
I glanced at my phone.

122
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,920
Earlier, my daughter had sent me a message saying

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,880
"Dad,"

124
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,080
suddenly a mysterious person said

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,960
if you can start a livestream right now,

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,000
they'll give you a large sum of money.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,280
My daughter wanted to livestream in my place.

128
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,560
Thinking about it,

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,200
since my daughter was going to livestream for me,

130
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
she would definitely need to enter my livestream room.

131
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
So I opened the livestream room to check,

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
and found out my livestream room had been banned.

133
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,840
Then I went online

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
and searched for that livestream clip.

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,640
I found that my daughter had fainted

136
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
in the park where we often do livestreams.

137
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,120
I was really worried and rushed to that park.

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,880
But there was nothing there.

139
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Since the livestream was shut down,

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
our company must have

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
found out about this.

142
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
Then I went back to the company,

143
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,880
and found it suddenly deserted.

144
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Then there was nothing left.

145
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,360
From then on, I lost contact with my daughter.

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
Because I also needed to make money.

147
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,840
Then I suddenly realized

148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,280
that this company was hiring.

149
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,520
They were looking for welders.

150
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,040
So, were you the sales champion?

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
The frog mascot of this company

152
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,400
I had no idea about it at all

153
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
So that day when we went to the second floor

154
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
I wasn't really curious

155
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,320
Why is there a frog here

156
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
What does this mean

157
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
TOP1 has come back to life

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,800
How do you know all this

159
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,080
Is there something

160
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,840
Tell me

161
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
No

162
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
It's just that after all this happened

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
I felt something was off

164
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,400
At the time, I couldn't act out

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,320
Because there were cameras

166
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
I didn't know those people either

167
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
What was really going on

168
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,520
Then that night, I secretly went back to the second floor

169
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,840
I found this phone charm inside

170
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,880
So I was sure these things were mine

171
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
So my little frog might also

172
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,640
be closely connected to this company

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
This is Tui Youfu's diary.

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,280
I think I understand what Frog Dad said.

175
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Just being alive is the greatest meaning.

176
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
A streamer who can't make money.

177
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
An Wenzhe wrote about you, right?

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
What he wrote in here is

179
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Frog Dad's bowl of hot noodle soup

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
warmed me up.

181
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
It's me, it must be me.

182
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
An Wenzhe treats him as

183
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
an online dad now.

184
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
A virtual dad.

185
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
A source of emotional support.

186
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,240
An Wenzhe came here

187
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
actually to find me.

188
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
What the heck?

189
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
But we didn't know each other before.

190
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
He might be my fan.

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,480
And then?

192
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,400
This one at the back.

193
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Cup.

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,360
This is my cup.

195
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
tantantan8511

196
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,440
It's this account.

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
He controlled Frog Dad.

198
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,920
At first,

199
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,880
he used the gimmick of a "rebirth livestream."

200
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,600
It attracted a lot of people.

201
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
They went to watch the resurrected Frog Dad.

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,919
Later, he even sent the popular Frog Dad

203
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,159
into the killing livestream.

204
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,760
I think what his story proves

205
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,799
is that An Wenzhe is a good person.

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
But if he and An Wenzhe are on good terms,

207
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,160
he couldn't have killed An Wenzhe.

208
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,080
No, they're just online friends.

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,000
He doesn't know me, and I don't know him.

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
Only when I put on that outfit

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
can he recognize me.

212
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,880
Because in Bai Huanzi's mind,

213
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
this An guy is the one who invested in Tan Qian.

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,640
And Tan Qian is already dead.

215
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,680
He deserved to die.

216
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Right.

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,000
He wants to find the real culprit behind the scenes.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,840
It's this boss named An.

219
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
He even said we're a bunch of "ignorant" people.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,720
I was really angry.

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
He even insulted our character.

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,240
The motive for murder is

223
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
because he called us "ignorant."

224
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,240
No.

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,120
It's fine if he says that about others.

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
But he specifically said you are.

227
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
Even I wanted to kill him.

228
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,440
Now I want to publicly be his X.

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
Don't mess with it.

230
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
What's wrong? Is it garbled? What's going on?

231
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,560
What is this?

232
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
What does that mean?

233
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
It's not garbled.

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,120
The young hacker has successfully decrypted the boss's phone.

235
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,840
Retrieving the boss's phone interface.

236
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
Reporting to you, boss.

237
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
I want to add Frog Dad to Room 49.

238
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
To create a spirit-communicating livestream room.

239
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
Can I call you to discuss the details?

240
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,880
Boss.

241
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Someone is coming to inspect the factory tomorrow.

242
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Don't worry.

243
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
I'll make sure the workshop is flawless.

244
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,240
No one will find any problems.

245
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Take them around for the inspection.

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
Don't let him out of your sight.

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Okay, boss.

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,680
I'll be on full alert.

249
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,520
It's just tantantan.

250
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
Talking with a boss behind the scenes.

251
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,400
That's right.

252
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
So this boss behind the scenes is bad, right?

253
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,520
He's not the mysterious person we mentioned.

254
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,720
He's good, he said to stop it.

255
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,160
That's right.

256
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,400
Next page.

257
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,760
According to audience feedback,

258
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,040
the hidden and regular livestreams

259
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
are no longer fresh or exciting enough.

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
So three new limited-edition livestreams have been added.

261
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
Killing livestream.

262
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
Incitement, greed, violence.

263
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,720
Spreading rumors, invasion of privacy.

264
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
These are common evils.

265
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,120
They are the source of evil.

266
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,480
Based on human evil,

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
design eighty-one of them.

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,440
Only the top supporter can choose?

269
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,880
The top supporter has made their choice.

270
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,360
The game begins.

271
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,200
Spreading rumors.

272
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Things are getting more complicated.

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
We need to hurry.

274
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,560
What?

275
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,120
This is really scary.

276
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
Help!

277
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
Is anyone there?

278
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,280
Save me!

279
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,280
Someone has to "die" every time.

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,280
Next page.

281
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,120
We've obtained control of Tan Qian's darknet.

282
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,880
Although we still can't crack the boss's account,

283
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
we'll be able to deal with the boss himself soon.

284
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,920
Then the darknet will be completely ours.

285
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,760
Us.

286
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,720
So this An guy hired a hacker.

287
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,400
What's wrong?

288
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Who is this?

289
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,040
Is it An Wenzhe? No.

290
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,600
No, isn't this you?

291
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,640
No, isn't this you?

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Explain what's going on here first.

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,800
Isn't this your photo here?

294
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,600
He’s already sat down.

295
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,920
He’s ready to tell the truth now.

296
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,160
He’s given up already.

297
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
Stop looking at us like that.

298
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,400
Sorry, everyone.

299
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
Actually, I

300
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,400
am the real owner of this streaming base.

301
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,040
I am the real owner of this streaming base.

302
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,280
Boss.

303
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,520
So you're the big boss.

304
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
That's right.

305
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,360
I never would have thought.

306
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
This Tan Qian

307
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,560
is just an executor I hired.

308
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
Everything here,

309
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,880
including all the killing streams,

310
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,600
and all the candies,

311
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
it was all part of my plan.

312
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Someone was targeting me.

313
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
This is a streaming factory.

314
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,080
Killing streams.

315
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
The reason I check

316
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
the cameras in here every day

317
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,920
is because I want to

318
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
I only get pleasure from doing this myself.

319
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,800
Are you even human? You kill people.

320
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,920
So you've been killing people all along.

321
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,960
For so many years.

322
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
You've been on this livestream the whole time.

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Constantly streaming your killings.

324
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,880
You've killed countless people already, haven't you?

325
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Yes.

326
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,040
Why did you do this?

327
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,280
I have only one question.

328
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Did you kill the little frog?

329
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
One day, Tan Qian told me,

330
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,640
He said, "Boss,"

331
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,480
"During our livestream,"

332
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,760
"an unexpected incident happened."

333
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,920
And then?

334
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,880
He said he had already taken care of it.

335
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
He told me not to worry.

336
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Are you talking about his daughter falling?

337
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,840
That's right.

338
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Because I'm not responsible for carrying out the operations.

339
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,080
He only needs to report his work to me.

340
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,440
That's the kind of relationship we have.

341
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
So what's your relationship with An Wenzhe?

342
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't know him.

343
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,840
Just the day before, Tan Qian sent me a message.

344
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,680
He said, "Boss,"

345
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
someone is coming to our company for an inspection.

346
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,920
I thought, let them inspect if they want.

347
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
But our secrets can't be leaked.

348
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,040
So I told Tan Qian to accompany him.

349
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,640
So this An Wenzhe

350
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,280
was the person who came for the inspection yesterday.

351
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,400
But suddenly, yesterday, Tan Qian died.

352
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,120
Suddenly, An Wenzhe showed up.

353
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
He said he was going to take over the company.

354
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
I was stunned at the time.

355
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,920
Starting today,

356
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,200
this Tuitian Food Factory will be taken over by me.

357
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,720
In other words, I'm your boss now.

358
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
I wanted to say, I'm the owner of this company.

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
What right does he have to take over?

360
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
So in the middle of the night,

361
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
I went to his room.

362
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,400
His office.

363
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,560
I went into his secret room.

364
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
I saw this

365
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,600
message on the phone.

366
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
It was timestamped 12:38.

367
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,280
There was a hacker he hired

368
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,200
saying that Tan Qian's account had been unlocked.

369
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,480
Yes.

370
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,080
But as for my account,

371
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
he hasn't unlocked it yet.

372
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
He wrote here that

373
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
although he still can't crack the boss's account,

374
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,240
but as for the boss himself,

375
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,040
he'll be dealt with soon.

376
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,240
He wants to get rid of you.

377
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,600
He wants to kill you.

378
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,240
He knows you're the boss.

379
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,440
He knows who you are.

380
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
I don't know if he knows who I am.

381
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,160
But he came to take over my company.

382
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
This is my place.

383
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
What right does he have, right?

384
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,920
So you want to kill him.

385
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
That's right, I admit I wanted to kill him.

386
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,120
So your motive for murder

387
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
is because you found out

388
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
he wanted to take over your company.

389
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
So you wanted to kill him.

390
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,080
He was about to expose your identity.

391
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
That's right.

392
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,160
Look at that smile you had while holding your phone.

393
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
The next second, you were about to pull out a knife.

394
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,440
Your motive for murder is even stronger than his.

395
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,640
And let me tell you,

396
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
the worst thing about you is

397
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,200
you even changed your clothes in the middle of the night

398
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
and your hair parting.

399
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,640
That's so infuriating.

400
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,280
Wait a second.

401
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,440
The little hacker has successfully taken over the livestream backend.

402
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,080
It's all places under surveillance.

403
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,000
How are these people still alive?

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,600
It looks like they're in...

405
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,120
The main control room feed.

406
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,880
So Ning Dengpao is the mastermind behind it all.

407
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
Still, we should thank Ning Dengpao.

408
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,040
The "Slaughter" livestream has brought me a lot of fun.

409
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,760
Haha, on the surface he's just a little electrician.

410
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,880
But in reality, he's the big boss.

411
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
That's a really cool character setup.

412
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm going to unbox now, Ning Dengpao.

413
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
Ning Dengpao, you guys are clearly the ones doing the killing.

414
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,960
Trash, scum, get lost.

415
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,560
He thinks the viewers are the real killers, right?

416
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,839
He was boycotted offline.

417
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
Then he posted on Weibo saying,

418
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,200
"You guys are the ones doing the killing."

419
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,960
In the bathroom.

420
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,839
What is this?

421
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,240
What's this?

422
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,560
What kind of public bathroom is this?

423
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,839
Why did you put our front door...

424
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,680
So my home is a public bathroom now?

425
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,640
I live in a toilet?

426
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,440
Look at your tissue box.

427
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,760
That spot with the tissues.

428
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,079
That's not a wastebasket.

429
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,960
And it's not a tissue dispenser either.

430
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
That's the mailbox at my front door.

431
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
I thought it was a bathroom.

432
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,280
I thought it was in the bathroom.

433
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,160
People insult me in public restrooms.

434
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,480
They say I'm a piece of "shit."

435
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,800
That's how it is, friends.

436
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,480
Why am I doing this killing livestream?

437
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,240
Because I hate.

438
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,000
All humans

439
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,200
Humans

440
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
You hate humans

441
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,680
I hate all of you humans

442
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,080
Why is that?

443
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
Because ever since I was a child

444
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,920
I was often bullied

445
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,000
And my only friend

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
was a little stray dog

447
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,320
His name was Wangwang, and he always stayed with me

448
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,520
One time, when I was being bullied by my classmates

449
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,000
They hit me

450
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
When they slapped my face

451
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,040
The little stray dog ran out

452
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
He came to save me

453
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
He stood in front of me

454
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,880
and bit one of them

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,800
He saved my life

456
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
I ran home in a panic

457
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
The next day, I went to look for the dog

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,000
but I couldn't find him

459
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,920
On the third night

460
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,240
I found, in a trash can near my house

461
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
that the little dog had already been

462
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,320
And then I

463
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,040
missed it a lot

464
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,920
I really longed for it

465
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,600
So I thought, I'll work hard at school

466
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,320
and become someone really amazing

467
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,160
I want to create an immortal dog

468
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
an artificial intelligence dog

469
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,240
Yes, after my relentless efforts

470
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,880
I succeeded

471
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,240
I created this

472
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
artificial intelligence electronic dog

473
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
and I also made a lot of money

474
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,360
because I had this invention

475
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,240
After that, I sold many of them

476
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,520
Actually, this dog

477
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
my original intention in designing it

478
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
was to accompany every lonely person

479
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
I programmed it

480
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,120
so that it would

481
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,680
actively interact with people

482
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
This dog has

483
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,120
the ability to learn on its own

484
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,360
Whatever you humans like to hear

485
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
that's what I'll say to you

486
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
If you like watching violent things

487
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,160
those bloody things

488
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,760
I'll give you that kind of feedback

489
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
Then one day, suddenly

490
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,440
one of the users of this little dog

491
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,160
committed suicide

492
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,680
Everyone stood up and said

493
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,440
This dog is just a killing machine.

494
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,240
Then, from a moral high ground,

495
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,400
they said this robot dog is wrong.

496
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Creating it is wrong.

497
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,520
So you want to turn around and kill people.

498
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,760
You want to return this evil to us.

499
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,120
That's right.

500
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,800
So I took all

501
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
the money I made from AI

502
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,280
and bought a company.

503
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
I want to do live killing broadcasts.

504
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,880
Then just kill them.

505
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,800
Why do you want to kill us?

506
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,600
To me, you're all the same.

507
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,480
What about now?

508
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,560
Has anything changed?

509
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,120
It's hard to say.

510
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,160
I never expected this.

511
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,880
Wait a second.

512
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,120
There's something else here.

513
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,200
Seven letters.

514
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Three on the left, four on the right.

515
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,960
The mouse is still moving.

516
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
An Wenzhe has an English name.

517
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,720
It's Avenger.

518
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,280
Avenger.

519
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
Avenger.

520
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,840
Avenger.

521
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
You can call me President An.

522
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
AVENGER has been opened.

523
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
List of victims

524
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
The deceased, Bai Yun

525
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,040
This is from that limited-access livestream

526
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,120
The Black Earth Era

527
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,680
Six people

528
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,240
It's my turn

529
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,880
Hello, everyone

530
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm Bai Yun

531
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,280
Hello, everyone

532
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,920
Bai Yun

533
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,840
This is also

534
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,520
This is also

535
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,360
Black Earth

536
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,240
They're all dead

537
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,280
You planned this

538
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,560
You arranged all of this

539
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:17,920
Yes

540
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,880
You're too cruel

541
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,200
You're a bit too bloody

542
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
Do you know the difference between humans and machines

543
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,640
What is it

544
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,880
When a machine receives evil

545
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,640
It returns evil

546
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,240
But you're human. When you receive evil

547
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,480
You should return kindness, love, truth, and beauty

548
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Go and wake everyone up

549
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,800
That's right

550
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
I think humans are inferior to machines

551
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
Okay.

552
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,920
Today I'll show you

553
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,440
the difference between humans and machines.

554
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Swing and hit him.

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
Hit him until he wakes up.

556
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,160
They just wrote a few words at your doorstep.

557
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
But what about these people?

558
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
What did they do wrong?

559
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,080
What did we do wrong?

560
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,160
When you were locked up and almost suffocating,

561
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,520
we were here, worried sick.

562
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,920
We wanted to save you.

563
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,960
We tried our best to save you.

564
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
Because you have friends.

565
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
You still have kind people.

566
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,400
But what about these people?

567
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,840
That was your own choice.

568
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,800
You didn't have to save me.

569
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Okay.

570
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,000
Alright.

571
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,320
Once we walk out this door,

572
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,040
you and I will be...

573
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,120
But under the cause of death for these people,

574
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
it should all be written by An Wenzhe himself.

575
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,760
We won't stop until the deep grudge is avenged.

576
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,280
The notes below are different.

577
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,120
Right.

578
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,600
Each person's is different.

579
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,920
Were they written by their family members?

580
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,800
Or by someone related to them?

581
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,680
And there's also this phone.

582
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:02,960
No.

583
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,560
An Wenzhe has way too many phones.

584
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,240
Every phone has his own selfies.

585
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Can't the boss have a few more phones?

586
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,280
It's open.

587
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,400
Hurry, we're about to solve the case!

588
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,680
An Wenzhe pretended to be the five million from the crowdfunding.

589
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,480
That's how he got in.

590
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
He did it to destroy this base.

591
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Only by burning the true culprit's evil

592
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,920
can the victims' souls be illuminated.

593
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,320
You must find the murderer.

594
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,480
Make sure this person is brought to justice.

595
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
He put the six of us

596
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
in that place.

597
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
He wanted to collect our voiceprints.

598
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
That is, the unique features of our voices.

599
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,880
He used the voiceprints to identify which of us was the boss.

600
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,120
Each person, according to the pinyin,

601
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,560
should read the following content out loud.

602
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,240
biá piā miā fiā

603
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,680
giào giào hià hià hià

604
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,440
Everyone reads it.

605
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,480
Each person reads it once.

606
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
biá piā miā fiā

607
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,120
giào giào hià hià hià

608
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
So we misunderstood him.

609
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
He actually didn't want to kill us.

610
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,720
That's right.

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,080
He just wanted to find the boss.

612
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,800
Yes.

613
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,760
But before the little hacker

614
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
found out he was the boss,

615
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,600
he was killed by one of the others.

616
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,200
Then the little hacker finally discovered and said

617
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,280
there was someone else behind Ning Dengpao.

618
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,560
This person is even more mysterious.

619
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,040
No information can be found about them.

620
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,080
There’s actually someone behind Ning Dengpao.

621
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,160
But this person isn’t obvious.

622
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,040
Because there’s only one person whose story hasn’t been told.

623
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,520
I really don’t have a story.

624
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,280
I’m just an ordinary person.

625
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
When I came in, I thought

626
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,520
I’d have to play games just to make a living.

627
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
You “foolish” humans,

628
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,880
you never stop chattering.

629
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,920
Listen to me.

630
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
Sorry.

631
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
This mysterious person

632
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,880
is actually my boss behind the scenes.

633
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,000
Actually, this killing livestream

634
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
was just an idea I had.

635
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
But it was hard for me to make it happen.

636
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
I don’t know how this mysterious person found out

637
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,360
that I had this

638
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,280
idea of doing a killing livestream.

639
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
He came to me.

640
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,440
He invested five million in me.

641
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,960
He also helped me accomplish something.

642
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,480
And what was that?

643
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,680
Every time there was a killing livestream,

644
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,560
someone would die.

645
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
The final corpse

646
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,760
would be taken care of for you.

647
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,440
That’s right.

648
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
A cleaner.

649
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
That person handled the aftermath for him.

650
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,600
The sixth killing livestream has ended.

651
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,280
Administrators can use the teleportation pod

652
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,440
to return to the factory.

653
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,120
Let's go.

654
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,160
All the clues have been put in the box.

655
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,640
Next, we will enter the X confirmation phase.

656
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,240
Why are you guys like this?

657
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,560
What do you mean?

658
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Let's see if you're X.

659
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
That's pretty cool.

660
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm waiting here too.

661
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,920
The word "innocent" is written all over my face.

662
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
I don't want to watch anymore.

663
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,520
I don't want to watch anymore.

664
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,200
I've seen enough.

665
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,080
I can't keep watching.

666
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,000
Why?

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,080
Why is he laughing?

668
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Why are you laughing?

669
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,080
I think she's funny.

670
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,600
I think she's funny.

671
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,120
He thinks you're funny.

672
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
You're all laughing at me.

673
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,840
Turns out I'm the funniest one.

674
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,320
I can't help it, I just want to laugh when I see her.

675
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,160
Alright, stop joking around.

676
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,280
So many murders have happened,

677
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,480
and you're still chatting and laughing.

678
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,400
Starting at zero frames

679
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,440
That's so scary

680
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,280
You're the one who tells the most jokes

681
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,080
Should we tie him up first to vent our anger?

682
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
Everyone, sit properly

683
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
Did I say you could stand?

684
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,320
Good

685
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,720
What's with those two?

686
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Come on

687
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,440
I'll support you

688
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
It feels like we're at a boarding school

689
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,920
Getting scolded by the teacher after lunch

690
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,080
I hope everyone's statements

691
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,800
have a subject, verb, and object

692
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,920
Who, what, wants to do what

693
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,600
I'm afraid he'll kill me.

694
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,080
How do you know he wants to kill you?

695
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,560
How do you know he wants to kill you?

696
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,520
I just feel like those four ways to die

697
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,240
are the ways he wants to kill me.

698
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,000
I think something's off about this.

699
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,840
But that comic card

700
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,640
has the four of us on it.

701
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
All four of us are still alive and well.

702
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
So why do you think

703
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,160
that just because of this comic card, he will

704
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
prove that he wants to kill you?

705
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,800
Because when I found it,

706
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,880
I only solved my own part.

707
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
I only solved my own part.

708
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
That's a stretch.

709
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
Everyone's already started dancing.

710
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,840
I saw it.

711
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,200
I want to say something, is that okay?

712
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,280
Sure, go ahead.

713
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,080
Alright.

714
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,760
Even if he is the culprit,

715
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,320
Please don't make that assumption anymore, okay?

716
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,240
I still can't bring myself to vote for him. Why?

717
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,720
I still remember just now,

718
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
during the pool segment,

719
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,240
when I was trying to escape,

720
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,480
I told him, "You go up first, little brother."

721
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,320
He said, "No, brother,"

722
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,920
"Get on my back, you go up first."

723
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,440
"I'll carry you."

724
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,720
It's okay.

725
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,040
Really?

726
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,360
Let me try.

727
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,680
Really.

728
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,240
It's fine.

729
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
That moment right then,

730
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,800
moved me so much.

731
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,520
So in my heart, to me, he is

732
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,600
someone who...

733
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,880
Then for this round, we'll all vote for you.

734
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,960
Me?

735
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm not a bad person.

736
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,520
Why?

737
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,600
It's not your turn to talk about your motive yet. Sit down.

738
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,440
Okay.

739
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,760
Come on, you speak.

740
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,400
My motive for killing is very simple and straightforward.

741
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,840
I just wanted to kill him.

742
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,280
To avenge my daughter.

743
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,160
It's that simple.

744
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,080
Alright, you, stand up.

745
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,800
You.

746
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,960
You brought us "ignorant" people

747
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,920
and tricked us into working here.

748
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,640
You helped this streaming company recruit people.

749
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
You work under me.

750
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,320
And you.

751
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,360
And you.

752
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,560
What did I do?

753
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,720
You posted links in the group chat.

754
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,840
To advertise for us.

755
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,160
Just to get those

756
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,680
cheap skins worth three or five yuan.

757
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,680
Skins worth just a few yuan.

758
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
You ended up hurting so many people.

759
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,080
And you.

760
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,920
And you.

761
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,680
And you.

762
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,800
Turns out you're the mastermind behind it all.

763
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,600
You took advantage of people's greed.

764
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,640
You exploited people's opportunistic mindset.

765
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,120
And did so many bad things.

766
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,240
If you hadn't built this kind of platform,

767
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
no one would have lost their families.

768
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,520
No one would have lost so much money at home.

769
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,320
Just to gamble on your thing,

770
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
they've already lost everything.

771
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,320
I can't even get a word in anymore.

772
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,960
I'll be taken away in a moment.

773
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,160
This is my fate in a moment.

774
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,080
But right now,

775
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,600
none of us are good people.

776
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,360
So none of you are good people anymore.

777
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,800
Don't come blaming me.

778
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,720
So the ones who deserve to die

779
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,840
are us.

780
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,560
I just did a live broadcast of a killing.

781
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,000
But the ones really telling us what to do

782
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,280
are those viewers, the ones sending money.

783
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
He put all the blame on the viewers.

784
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,440
I just put a gun here.

785
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,640
Whether you use this gun to kill someone

786
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
is it the gun's fault?

787
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,680
If the gun is the problem,

788
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,040
then the gun is illegal.

789
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,600
Okay.

790
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,720
A knife. This is a knife.

791
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
Is it a controlled knife or what?

792
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,280
It's just a kitchen knife from home placed here.

793
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,080
If the viewers in the chat say

794
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,160
"Use the knife to untie it and let it go,"

795
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,600
That's right.

796
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,240
Then it would be let go.

797
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,080
Yes.

798
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,840
Wait, has your company ever let anyone go?

799
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,200
Never.

800
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,640
Never.

801
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Because that's where the evil in human nature lies.

802
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,120
But

803
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,840
no one can walk onto the street with a knife or weapon.

804
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,200
That's right.

805
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,680
There can be no order without rules.

806
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,040
That's right.

807
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,400
You created this thing,

808
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
but you didn't set any rules for it.

809
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,400
There are rules.

810
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,240
What rules?

811
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,680
Just that you can't go onto the street.

812
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,560
So you set up this live streaming company.

813
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,080
Okay.

814
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,000
I have only one question.

815
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
You hate humanity so much,

816
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
why don't you kill yourself?

817
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,680
You brought a group of people

818
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,960
and tricked them into coming here to do livestreams.

819
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,120
You clearly knew what livestreaming was like.

820
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,000
Back then, I didn't know this was a livestream factory.

821
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,120
At that time, I only knew it was a candy factory.

822
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,560
We didn't know anything about it.

823
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,120
The difference between the three of us and you is

824
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,440
we were all passive in this.

825
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
You organized it, but you claim you were passive.

826
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,920
I did it to help the workers make money.

827
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
You also did it for money.

828
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
You weren't doing it to get rich?

829
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
I already turned myself in just now.

830
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,840
I said I was the boss behind all this.

831
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,360
No.

832
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,800
I'll be taken away soon.

833
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,400
Alright.

834
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,720
Okay.

835
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
It's not yet at the stage of "dog bites man, man bites dog."

836
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,360
Or the stage of "man bites man, dog bites dog."

837
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,320
Don't insult dogs.

838
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Dogs are the kindest.

839
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
It's us humans who are...

840
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Alright.

841
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,000
It's true, you all have murderous intent.

842
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,240
Two years ago, I was working construction.

843
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,680
While I was working, from the scaffolding next to me,

844
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,480
a woman fell down.

845
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,840
It was the little frog girl.

846
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,440
Yesterday, when we went to the livestream room,

847
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,840
I suddenly noticed

848
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,560
there was a rabbit like this on the table.

849
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,760
This rabbit belonged to that little frog girl.

850
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,800
I discovered An Wenzhe.

851
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
He was looking for this little girl.

852
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,360
I was afraid An Wenzhe came to kill me.

853
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,440
I was worried I still couldn't get in

854
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
to that esports club.

855
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,280
When no one was around,

856
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,480
I sneaked into his room.

857
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,720
I found this notebook.

858
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,920
An Wenzhe had planned

859
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,560
how the four of you would die.

860
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,040
So I thought

861
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,280
he was going to trap me here

862
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,400
and slaughter me.

863
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,280
I am Frog Dad.

864
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,880
I am Frog Dad.

865
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,560
Little Frog is my daughter.

866
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,120
I believe he killed my daughter.

867
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,240
Actually, I

868
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,640
am the real owner of this livestream base.

869
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,680
I will take over this Sweet Treats food factory.

870
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,320
He came and took my company.

871
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
This is my place.

872
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,320
Alright, let's collect evidence first.

873
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,040
There are still many clues that haven't been found.

874
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,720
For example, the back door area leading to the second floor.

875
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,200
You're talking about this place, right?

876
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,760
Yes.

877
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,920
We need to go take a look.

878
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,960
See if there's any discovery.

879
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,520
They're all ungrateful people.

880
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,240
They all stepped on my shoulders.

881
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,320
Let's go.

882
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,960
They gained their own lives.

883
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,320
Those few moments just now,

884
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,640
he was the one who saved us.

885
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,480
Deliberately trying to win our favor.

886
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,680
Assassin.

887
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Deliberately trying to win over.

888
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,400
You can see it that way.

889
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
I can see it that way too.

890
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,320
You call it ungratefulness.

891
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,120
That's fine.

892
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,920
No problem.

893
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,320
Being ungrateful is no problem.

894
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,120
What is this?

895
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,320
A knife.

896
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,800
Isn't this the rope used to tie us up?

897
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,920
Yes.

898
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,080
The rope.

899
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,000
You tied us up.

900
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,680
You've been here before.

901
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,920
I just went to check the garage door.

902
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,960
And the back door of the factory.

903
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,400
What time did you go?

904
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,160
Were you the only one who came here?

905
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,639
I've been here.

906
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,280
Why did you come?

907
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,800
Why did you come?

908
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,600
At night, I secretly went back to the second floor.

909
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
When I went to the second floor, I passed by here.

910
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,719
That's right.

911
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,239
Then let's count him in too.

912
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,800
There's something very important in here.

913
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,400
What is it?

914
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,679
It's this.

915
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,679
It's this fresh air system.

916
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,239
Once the fresh air system is turned on,

917
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,239
it can circulate air throughout the entire factory.

918
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,960
You can put the drug in here.

919
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,280
If you put a sedative in here,

920
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,360
it can knock out everyone in the factory.

921
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,760
Press the thing inside.

922
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,080
Take it.

923
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,719
Guys,

924
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,600
look.

925
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,800
They're knocked out.

926
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,440
Yes, knocked out.

927
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,920
There's a sedative in the filter.

928
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,040
Friends,

929
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,679
safety matches.

930
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,520
He lit them.

931
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,880
What is that black tape?

932
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,240
I don't know.

933
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,880
It says here,

934
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,480
It says "super strong adhesive" here.

935
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,680
A method of murder.

936
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Could it be that An Wenzhe?

937
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,400
He lit this.

938
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,760
He wanted to set this up for us.

939
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,840
The killer didn't come here in person.

940
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,360
Then there's a problem.

941
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,040
If all of this was done by An Wenzhe,

942
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,360
then the killer must have known

943
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,440
about An Wenzhe's plan.

944
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,360
That's right.

945
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,360
Shall we go up and take a look?

946
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay.

947
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,800
Is there anything else? Let's take another look.

948
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,360
I think we still need to search more carefully.

949
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Who are you?

950
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,640
What are you looking for?

951
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,080
Yeah, who are you?

952
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm just a citizen.

953
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,960
Are these all from what you searched through this morning?

954
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,560
A rope.

955
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,720
Why is there a rope here?

956
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,360
There's a remote.

957
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
This isn't the first floor.

958
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,480
Is it the one from his office?

959
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,880
Come on, take it out.

960
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,760
Take everything out.

961
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
There's something here.

962
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,840
Wait a second.

963
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,000
Strong spray.

964
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
This is for people with insomnia.

965
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,640
Colorless liquid.

966
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,720
The label on the bottle says it's called

967
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,600
Strong sleep spray.

968
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,280
That person used these from the previous case.

969
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Used the tools.

970
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,880
Right.

971
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,440
Smart.

972
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,040
Clever.

973
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,560
Wait.

974
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,480
This killer is really clever.

975
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Why did he need to use this?

976
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
He must have encountered an obstacle.

977
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,880
On his escape route,

978
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,920
so he needed to use this.

979
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,160
To get rid of an obstacle.

980
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,920
Then his only obstacle is An Wenzhe.

981
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Right.

982
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,520
Have we ever considered a question?

983
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,120
Go ahead.

984
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,680
Why did this An guy come up to pull the switch?

985
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,960
Yeah, why pull the switch?

986
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,560
This is the first floor's circuit breaker.

987
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,840
Why don't we go check the first floor now?

988
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,120
Let's go.

989
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,760
Let's check inside that big factory.

990
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,720
See if there's anything else.

991
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,000
Let's go.

992
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,240
This can't be pressed here.

993
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,960
The problem is,

994
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,640
You seem much smarter than yesterday.

995
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,360
Compared to yesterday.

996
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,240
Weren't you the suspect yesterday?

997
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,520
You're pretending to be clueless, aren't you?

998
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,280
You look ten times sharper today.

999
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,240
This morning,

1000
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,120
when did we wake up?

1001
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,640
What time was it?

1002
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,520
Eight o'clock.

1003
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,240
We woke up at eight.

1004
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,560
How many hours does that sedative last?

1005
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,920
Six hours.

1006
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,640
Six hours.

1007
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,800
So it could have been two o'clock.

1008
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
when we inhaled the sedative.

1009
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,880
Next, it's a matter of the timeline.

1010
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,400
Come on.

1011
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,680
I should be the first.

1012
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Fifteen to thirty.

1013
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,040
What time?

1014
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,920
Fifteen to thirty.

1015
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,680
Twelve o'clock.

1016
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,920
Early morning of the 26th

1017
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
You went to his office

1018
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,280
Yes

1019
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,440
Then what time did you check the back door?

1020
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
At twenty past

1021
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,680
At 12:20

1022
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,200
Look, between fifteen and thirty

1023
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I spent five minutes in his office

1024
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,240
Then spent another ten minutes

1025
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,120
Checking the front door

1026
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,000
And checking the back door

1027
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
After that, you stayed in your room the whole time

1028
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,200
Didn't go out

1029
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,960
That's right

1030
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,880
Didn't come out again

1031
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,200
Okay

1032
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,480
Your timeline is very clear

1033
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,520
What about you?

1034
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,920
Ning Dengpao

1035
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,680
At 12:35

1036
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,160
Went to the boss's office

1037
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,720
Searched it

1038
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,480
Couldn't find anything

1039
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,520
And then?

1040
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,920
At thirty-eight past

1041
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,320
Noticed his phone got a message

1042
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,760
Noticed his phone got a message

1043
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,920
Whose phone?

1044
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,240
An Wenzhe's phone

1045
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,040
A message popped up

1046
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,680
It was sent by Little Hacker

1047
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,960
After I finished taking the photo,

1048
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,480
I thought to myself,

1049
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,720
so he wanted to take my property.

1050
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,800
Alright, I need to go back and think.

1051
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,880
How to kill him.

1052
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,800
So at thirty-eight minutes past,

1053
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,520
after reading that message,

1054
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,400
and after taking the photo,

1055
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,280
I returned to my electrical room at forty minutes past.

1056
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,160
Twelve forty.

1057
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,920
Yes, twelve forty.

1058
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,840
Your murderous intent was strong again,

1059
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,680
and it appeared

1060
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,240
early.

1061
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,960
At 12:15,

1062
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,080
I was in the dormitory at that time.

1063
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,880
I stayed in the dormitory the whole time.

1064
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,600
I had been in the dormitory before that.

1065
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,560
I saw him go out.

1066
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Then fifteen minutes later,

1067
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,680
he came back.

1068
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,320
That matches his timeline.

1069
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:45,880
Yes.

1070
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,680
Then at 12:45,

1071
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,560
I was about to go check the streaming room.

1072
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,440
So between 12:00 and 12:45,

1073
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
you were in the dorm the whole time?

1074
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,640
Yes, I was in the dorm the whole time.

1075
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,360
Then I left the dormitory

1076
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,080
and passed through the office

1077
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,000
to get to the secret room.

1078
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,680
I took the elevator.

1079
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,720
I went to the streaming room.

1080
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,840
It was exactly 12:45 at that time.

1081
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,640
I saw him dismiss the streamer.

1082
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,760
You saw it.

1083
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,640
I took the rabbit next to the streamer.

1084
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,800
I was really scared at that moment.

1085
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,120
I wondered why this rabbit was here.

1086
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,720
I wanted to find the streaming staff.

1087
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,880
Who took this rabbit?

1088
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,440
So I went back to the office.

1089
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,080
I wanted to find the list of streaming staff.

1090
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,880
But I couldn't find it.

1091
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,200
Then I found something in the secret room.

1092
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,120
There was half a piece of paper in the box.

1093
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,840
It was about that "deep grudge in the snow."

1094
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,680
I got scared at that moment.

1095
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,600
I wondered if someone was back for revenge.

1096
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,200
You've been scared all along.

1097
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,920
Yes, that's right.

1098
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
What time did you go back to your dorm, still scared?

1099
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
I went up at forty-five.

1100
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,560
I was back in the dorm at fifty-five.

1101
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,280
At that time, I kept on

1102
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,880
ten minutes

1103
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,720
It only takes ten minutes round trip

1104
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
Your timing, right?

1105
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,400
Yes

1106
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,800
I was back in the dorm at 55 minutes past

1107
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,640
Then I was really scared

1108
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,360
Then at 1:15

1109
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,240
I left the dorm

1110
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,120
I was in the hallway

1111
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,320
You came out again at 1:15

1112
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,920
Yes

1113
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Came out at 1:15

1114
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
I called my mentor in the hallway

1115
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,280
Called the mentor

1116
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,760
That's right, that's my timeline

1117
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,120
So this

1118
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,000
clears you completely

1119
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
Because if at 1:15

1120
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,720
you only then had the intent to kill

1121
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,600
until 2 o'clock

1122
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,600
he would light that incense

1123
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,640
to make us all faint?

1124
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,280
Right, how could I possibly

1125
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,040
You wouldn't have time to prepare

1126
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,000
Why wouldn't I have time?

1127
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,960
No particular reason

1128
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
That's just my assumption

1129
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,640
You could

1130
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
Your assumption is wrong

1131
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,560
Okay

1132
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,000
Next, that Bai Hanzi

1133
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
Tell us your own timeline

1134
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,960
I went to the second floor at one o'clock.

1135
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,680
I went to the second floor at one o'clock.

1136
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,800
What was your reason for going to the second floor?

1137
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,680
I just wanted to take a walk after eating.

1138
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,560
That was the reason.

1139
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,920
So I suddenly went to the second floor.

1140
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,160
Because when we went there before,

1141
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,640
I saw Frog Dad.

1142
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,920
Because I knew Frog Dad was me.

1143
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,880
There were so many cameras.

1144
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,320
And so many people.

1145
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,560
I didn't dare show it at the time.

1146
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,240
So I had to wait until late at night when it was quiet.

1147
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,880
I sneaked upstairs quietly.

1148
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,200
Then I went to check it out.

1149
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
I understand.

1150
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,840
One o'clock... nine.

1151
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,800
I took the doll back to my room.

1152
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,200
I took the doll back to my room.

1153
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,720
Then inside the doll,

1154
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,840
I noticed the phone was lit up.

1155
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,920
I confirmed it was mine.

1156
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,840
Then I thought, there must be something fishy.

1157
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
So I decided to go to the office.

1158
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,080
To take another look.

1159
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,920
What time did you go to the office?

1160
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,560
I went to the office at 1:10.

1161
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,680
Then I discovered

1162
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,600
the key evidence.

1163
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,160
I gave it to you.

1164
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
This boss,

1165
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,480
he's the one who killed my daughter.

1166
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,080
So I have to take him down.

1167
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,600
So your murderous intent also appeared

1168
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,760
only at 1:10.

1169
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,040
Then there’s no such thing as

1170
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,360
discovering murderous intent so late.

1171
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,720
Impossible.

1172
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,960
Because all of you were very late.

1173
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Right.

1174
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,560
Many people, around midnight,

1175
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,440
looking at this timeline,

1176
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,720
were all active in the factory hall.

1177
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,280
So you must have left something behind.

1178
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,600
Right.

1179
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
Then let’s look again

1180
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,040
to see what else they left behind.

1181
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,520
Who is it?

1182
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,080
Who left something behind that hasn’t been found?

1183
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,080
There's nothing at all.

1184
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,920
There's a shoelace.

1185
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,880
You're amazing.

1186
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,760
Does everyone have one?

1187
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,320
Really?

1188
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,480
Isn't this the method for growing pothos?

1189
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Everyone has a shoelace.

1190
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,720
What's this?

1191
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,240
A voice recorder.

1192
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,880
Such a big thing.

1193
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,600
Impressive.

1194
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,320
Press and hold to turn it on.

1195
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,920
Hello?

1196
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,400
I'm missing something.

1197
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,480
It seems like someone found something.

1198
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,640
Proceed as planned.

1199
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,440
Proceed as planned.

1200
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,480
Now there are only six of them left in the factory.

1201
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,120
At two o'clock, I'll use a herbal sedative to knock them out.

1202
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,960
Two o'clock.

1203
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,280
Tie it to the second floor with packing rope.

1204
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,600
I'll eat a piece of aloe leaf in advance.

1205
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,080
To prevent myself from getting knocked out.

1206
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,800
No matter what,

1207
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
the murder livestream must go on.

1208
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,040
In this phone call,

1209
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,920
for the killer,

1210
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,400
the most useful information is about the aloe.

1211
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
Check which aloe has been cut.

1212
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,760
It has been cut.

1213
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,320
A piece has been removed.

1214
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,080
It's obvious that

1215
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,360
the culprit heard this thing

1216
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,000
and learned about the plan.

1217
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,560
They knew that aloe leaves could prevent fainting.

1218
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
So they put a piece in their mouth.

1219
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,920
Right.

1220
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,480
They pretended to be unconscious on the bed.

1221
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,240
Then they set up the scene.

1222
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,440
They just went along and got tied up.

1223
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,280
When we woke up,

1224
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,760
they also pretended to wake up.

1225
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,640
They were never actually unconscious.

1226
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,400
But I have a question.

1227
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,440
What question do you have?

1228
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,200
What was that spray for?

1229
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah, I don't know either.

1230
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,400
Are there no other leads?

1231
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,640
The back door and the scene.

1232
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,960
We still need to take another look.

1233
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,400
Right.

1234
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:46,760
Yes.

1235
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,680
Can this door be opened?

1236
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:54,760
It won't open.

1237
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,840
It won't open, it's locked.

1238
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,040
We can't get out.

1239
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,680
Is there any place that's purple?

1240
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,880
Because if that thing is sprayed,

1241
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,560
it will leave behind something purple.

1242
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:02,920
This.

1243
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,800
Over there.

1244
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,480
This spot.

1245
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,320
There's purple.

1246
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,480
Isn't this purple?

1247
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,000
I really...

1248
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,920
Tongcheng Travel is also purple.

1249
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,760
Yeah.

1250
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,320
Look up there.

1251
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,400
Flammable.

1252
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,840
There's nothing.

1253
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,840
What does "flammable" mean?

1254
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,800
Is it filled with safety matches?

1255
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,360
Safety matches are flammable.

1256
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,400
This rope can be set on fire.

1257
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,520
So?

1258
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,120
Think about it.

1259
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,720
One is missing.

1260
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,800
The one for striking matches.

1261
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,240
That part was torn off.

1262
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,240
The striking paper on top of the matchbox.

1263
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,280
Right.

1264
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,960
There are ten in a box.

1265
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,720
This is nine.

1266
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
So the culprit took one match.

1267
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,560
And tore this box.

1268
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,600
A mechanism.

1269
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,840
A mechanism.

1270
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,160
I got it.

1271
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,760
I got it.

1272
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,920
Maybe he

1273
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,200
For example, if that's the case,

1274
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,760
We just said he prepared that in advance.

1275
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,320
Sprayed to make someone faint.

1276
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,720
Spray to make them faint and just leave them there.

1277
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
He tied him up there.

1278
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,880
But this black rubber ring is still missing.

1279
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Super strong adhesive.

1280
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,680
Not sure what it's for.

1281
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,120
Okay.

1282
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,320
Then it must be a device.

1283
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,480
Let's go up and look for it.

1284
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,200
Alright.

1285
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,800
Is that what you mean?

1286
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,200
Yes.

1287
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,800
It should be.

1288
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,640
If that's the case,

1289
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Check if there are any marks of being tied on his wrists.

1290
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,080
There aren't any marks of being tied on the wrists.

1291
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,040
What's wrong?

1292
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,280
There are traces of burnt fibers on the wrench.

1293
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
The rope is tied up there.

1294
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,880
How does the rope get burned?

1295
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,600
Think about it, if he...

1296
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,520
As soon as the rope burns, the power trips, right?

1297
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,480
No, let me take a look at what this is.

1298
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,120
Ventriloquism.

1299
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,080
Why are you doing a ventriloquism act?

1300
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,480
This rope is tied here.

1301
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,920
It must be for lowering something.

1302
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,000
It's for opening.

1303
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,240
When it opens, we aren't inside, right?

1304
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
At that moment, yes.

1305
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,400
Its function is when it's pulled down.

1306
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,800
What can it do...

1307
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,640
After it's pulled down...

1308
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,000
Then it can be burned.

1309
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,920
The purpose of the spray

1310
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,000
I understand now.

1311
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,320
Go ahead.

1312
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,800
When we went out,

1313
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,840
we actually only saw that door moving.

1314
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,120
Right.

1315
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,400
What happened outside?

1316
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,920
Someone was knocking on the door.

1317
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,320
It was actually this corpse.

1318
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
He was moving when he was being electrocuted.

1319
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,280
That means the body was still alive at that time.

1320
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,960
We always had a misunderstanding that

1321
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,800
when he was moving, it was because he had just come up.

1322
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,240
Actually, if we can rule this out,

1323
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,560
Right.

1324
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,600
He was here the whole time.

1325
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,520
He was here the whole time.

1326
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,920
He was knocked out.

1327
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,720
He wasn't dead when he was here.

1328
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,640
Just now,

1329
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,800
when we just stepped out,

1330
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,120
as soon as the power switch was turned on,

1331
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,880
he was knocked out.

1332
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,200
He would move when electrocuted, too.

1333
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,680
That means the spray was used to knock him out.

1334
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,120
He was left here to sleep all night.

1335
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,200
Then it made it look like he came to open the switch himself.

1336
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,120
And then

1337
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,520
created the illusion that he accidentally died from electrocution.

1338
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,080
But our first-floor power switch

1339
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,640
what was it used for?

1340
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,160
Let's take another look.

1341
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,640
I think we should check it.

1342
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,040
Check the door handle.

1343
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,680
Is there anything?

1344
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:01,880
No.

1345
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,000
This...

1346
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,600
This...

1347
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,080
This...

1348
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,880
It's not friction, it's the mark of burnt fibers.

1349
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,200
The rope is fixed here.

1350
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,760
Try tying it, recreate the scene.

1351
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,160
Wait a moment.

1352
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,520
Come here.

1353
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,520
You tie it over there.

1354
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,000
So that's this one.

1355
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,040
That's the first spot.

1356
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,520
This is the second spot, right?

1357
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,400
Wait.

1358
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,760
I think this is too short, sorry.

1359
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,520
Because I think

1360
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,720
it might extend to a lower place.

1361
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,280
It extends to the first floor.

1362
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,840
So it controls the switch on the first floor.

1363
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,640
It could be

1364
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,680
it could be that conveyor belt.

1365
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,840
That's also possible.

1366
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Why is it a conveyor belt?

1367
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,520
Because as soon as he presses the switch,

1368
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,640
the conveyor belt starts running.

1369
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,560
It can then pull the rope.

1370
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
And the circuit breaker will come down.

1371
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,160
So that power switch

1372
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,320
is used to activate

1373
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,600
this time device.

1374
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,240
Because it was hanging down.

1375
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,880
Right?

1376
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,320
It's possible.

1377
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,360
It might have just hung all the way down.

1378
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,280
I got it.

1379
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,800
The end of the rope at the bottom

1380
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,840
must have been glued

1381
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,360
with strong adhesive.

1382
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,480
A conveyor belt would work.

1383
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,200
Strong adhesive.

1384
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,080
I really think it's a conveyor belt.

1385
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,840
Super glue

1386
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,280
Yes

1387
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
That's it

1388
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,960
This is it

1389
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,520
Impressive

1390
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,480
So impressive

1391
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,040
That's amazing

1392
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,480
But now that rope

1393
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,520
How did it disappear?

1394
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,640
How was it triggered?

1395
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,640
That match and the firecracker thing

1396
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,600
We haven't found it yet

1397
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:00,880
Right

1398
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,880
We haven't figured it out

1399
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,200
It must have caught fire

1400
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,440
When I left in the morning at the time of the incident

1401
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,520
there was a burnt smell

1402
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,560
At first, I thought it was the smell of an electric shock

1403
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,480
There’s a burnt smell.

1404
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes, there is.

1405
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,200
Even your nose can smell it.

1406
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,280
None of us can smell it.

1407
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,640
There definitely is.

1408
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,800
Let me give an example.

1409
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,640
Once that place catches fire,

1410
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,560
it will

1411
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,760
this rope will follow the conveyor belt

1412
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,280
and move downward.

1413
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,520
Right.

1414
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,160
So, is there something over there?

1415
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,240
Here.

1416
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,480
Here.

1417
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,000
What?

1418
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,800
Here.

1419
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,320
What?

1420
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,240
Bro.

1421
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,680
He stuck it here.

1422
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,440
Friction.

1423
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,160
Matchstick.

1424
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,840
He stuck this onto this.

1425
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,400
The matchstick like this.

1426
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
And then this thing...

1427
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:52,880
Yeah.

1428
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,280
Yeah.

1429
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, it catches fire when you walk by.

1430
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,480
Is this person a genius?

1431
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,360
So smart.

1432
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,960
Wait, I think he's a genius.

1433
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,480
He'd better come out right now.

1434
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,880
And admit to being a genius.

1435
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,440
I...

1436
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,080
I admit it.

1437
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,480
I think I did this.

1438
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,320
No, I admit it.

1439
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,120
This kind of thing...

1440
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,400
Alright, the case is solved.

1441
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,720
The case is solved.

1442
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,160
Solved.

1443
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,120
The case-solving process—it's solved.

1444
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,720
No problem.

1445
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,880
Very good.

1446
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,560
It must be like this.

1447
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,120
We've reconstructed the crime scene.

1448
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,360
So, who did it?

1449
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,640
I've already locked in my suspect.

1450
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,560
Who did you lock in?

1451
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,320
As for who I locked in...

1452
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,960
I don't want to reveal that yet.

1453
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,240
Let's go back to the front hall.

1454
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,320
Let's reconstruct the method of murder.

1455
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
First, we found a spray.

1456
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,400
Right.

1457
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,720
We found the main power switch on the first floor.

1458
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,200
And then, in...

1459
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,240
that secret room,

1460
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,720
we found lots of ropes, matches, and tape.

1461
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,600
These were all tools used by the culprit.

1462
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,320
The culprit definitely heard the recording.

1463
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Now, only six of them are left in the factory.

1464
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,720
At two o'clock, I used a herbal sedative to knock them out.

1465
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,320
They learned some of the victim's plans.

1466
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,920
He wanted to use this plan

1467
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,040
to kill the victim.

1468
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,640
But at the same time, he made sure he was present

1469
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,600
in the tied-up live broadcast room

1470
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,680
to create an alibi.

1471
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,480
So first, he

1472
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,320
knocked out the victim.

1473
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,720
He placed the victim next to the circuit breaker.

1474
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,560
He staged an accidental death.

1475
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,080
A scene of electrocution.

1476
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,840
Then he tied the circuit breaker with a rope.

1477
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,240
He pulled it downstairs.

1478
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,160
He attached it to the conveyor belt.

1479
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,000
Then he placed matches next to the conveyor belt.

1480
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,120
At the moment we woke up,

1481
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,360
he used the first floor power switch to turn on the electricity.

1482
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,600
The rope was pulled down by the force of the conveyor belt.

1483
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,560
The circuit breaker was turned off, and the rope ignited at the same time.

1484
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:38,880
Then,

1485
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,920
at the same time, the victim

1486
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,520
was electrocuted instantly.

1487
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
He started convulsing.

1488
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,600
That’s what we saw—

1489
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,200
when we opened our eyes, we saw that scene.

1490
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,960
He was convulsing,

1491
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,840
and there was the smell of burning matches.

1492
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,680
He created this illusion.

1493
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,360
Yes.

1494
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,200
Very good.

1495
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,480
I think this can be deduced.

1496
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,400
That’s really impressive.

1497
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,040
Detective, I have a method now

1498
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,040
to directly identify the culprit.

1499
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,440
That remote control, right?

1500
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,880
Go check for fingerprints. Don't tell me.

1501
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,640
Yes.

1502
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,920
It's fine, go on.

1503
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,280
Alright, just kidding.

1504
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,920
But it really is that remote control.

1505
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,880
Yesterday, it didn't have any batteries.

1506
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,560
Today, it has power.

1507
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,560
Who is the one messing with the power?

1508
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,200
Okay.

1509
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,640
But isn't this thing just

1510
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,560
a matter of having a battery

1511
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,720
or not having a battery?

1512
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,120
You don't necessarily have to be an electricity expert

1513
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,600
to understand it, right?

1514
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,720
But this battery model is very special.

1515
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,920
It's not a type that ordinary people can buy.

1516
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,840
I think that battery

1517
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
None of us can get out, we're locked in here.

1518
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,480
No, there's another problem.

1519
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,160
This thing

1520
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,800
Only you have the ability to electrocute someone.

1521
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,600
Don't

1522
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,080
Okay.

1523
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,840
Alright, that's fine.

1524
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,080
I'm waiting for you, I'm just waiting for you.

1525
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,360
Come.

1526
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1527
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,720
It's just that

1528
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,520
only you have the means to electrocute others.

1529
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,800
What is this called?

1530
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,120
This one.

1531
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,000
And also hanging.

1532
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,520
That satisfies the wire and electricity part.

1533
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,840
Right.

1534
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,040
Both electricity and wire are accounted for.

1535
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,800
Plus, you know he wants to find you.

1536
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,440
And you also fit the third point, suffocation.

1537
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,400
Because when she just said that

1538
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,440
for a moment, you

1539
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,040
You and I

1540
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,200
Okay

1541
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,120
You fit these three criteria very well

1542
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,320
This is a really outrageous thing

1543
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:34,920
Do you know that?

1544
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,640
Why?

1545
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:36,840
He said it

1546
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,080
This word is called

1547
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,280
Personally installed all the cameras

1548
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,600
But so far, what we've found is indirect

1549
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,560
Did you hear that?

1550
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,480
Indirect

1551
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,800
It wasn't me

1552
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,480
It's just because I installed the cameras

1553
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,160
It indirectly caused these people to be electrocuted

1554
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,280
What does that have to do with me?

1555
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,640
Yes

1556
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,920
All I did was install the cameras

1557
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,960
To convict him because of this

1558
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,080
I think that's a bit much

1559
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,000
No one said we have to convict

1560
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,160
I just want to hear

1561
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,480
Just saying

1562
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,880
With this thing here

1563
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,320
Otherwise, its existence is meaningless

1564
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,920
It adds another layer of suspicion

1565
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
You are the boss here

1566
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,320
Everything here was designed by you

1567
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,720
So you

1568
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,680
Are more likely to be the one who would

1569
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,280
The person who heard this call

1570
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,680
A person who better fits the conditions for committing the crime

1571
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,240
Anyway,

1572
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,560
I think the most significant time

1573
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,320
is 1:30.

1574
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,160
Right.

1575
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,120
1:30.

1576
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,920
He was making this call, right?

1577
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,600
Yes.

1578
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,400
So this killer

1579
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:30,680
um,

1580
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,040
must have been next to this person at that moment.

1581
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,240
Or nearby.

1582
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,760
That's not necessarily the case.

1583
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,240
This recorder

1584
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,240
I think it's very likely

1585
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,480
was a prerequisite.

1586
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,280
Right.

1587
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,640
So this recorder

1588
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,920
was probably placed there in advance by him.

1589
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,520
The killer must have gone back a second time.

1590
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,920
That recorder was used by our killer.

1591
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,760
There must be someone

1592
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,400
There is one person

1593
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,120
who went back to that room

1594
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,280
to make that recording.

1595
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,840
That's right.

1596
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,240
The key is, who would go back a second time?

1597
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,040
Wouldn't everyone do that?

1598
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,400
Not all four people would.

1599
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,440
According to our timeline deduction,

1600
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,720
he

1601
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,080
wandered around from fifteen to thirty minutes,

1602
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,040
then went back to get a computer.

1603
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,960
What was his original intention?

1604
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,760
His intention was to escape.

1605
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,680
So why did he go back a second time?

1606
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,200
He saw those cards.

1607
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,560
He thought

1608
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:29,880
that

1609
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,880
the one named An wanted to kill him.

1610
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,520
Right.

1611
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,200
If you were a normal person,

1612
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,920
and someone wanted to kill you,

1613
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,200
would you still go looking for him?

1614
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,760
He quietly finished looking at

1615
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,640
the cards,

1616
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,720
and never left the dorm again.

1617
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
That's his logic.

1618
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,840
Okay.

1619
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,640
So he had no reason to go back a second time.

1620
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,680
He's just like me.

1621
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,320
Why didn't you have a reason to go back a second time?

1622
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,400
Because I made a call at fifteen past.

1623
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,560
I learned from the old master

1624
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,280
that he wanted to hunt me down.

1625
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,320
That's when I realized this person

1626
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,040
was the one named An who was coming to kill me.

1627
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,280
At that moment, my mindset was

1628
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,440
how could I possibly go back again?

1629
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,360
Why would I run into him head-on?

1630
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,000
I was just scared.

1631
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,920
I was really scared.

1632
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,200
So I just hid in the dorm, afraid.

1633
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,040
Yes, I'm telling the truth.

1634
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,600
I was just scared.

1635
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,760
But what if he comes to the dorm

1636
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,840
and takes you out directly?

1637
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,160
Even then, I wouldn't go looking for him.

1638
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,360
I think what Heniba said makes sense.

1639
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,200
It's all based on the intent to kill.

1640
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,960
Is he trying to hide from An Wenzhe

1641
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,080
or is he trying to hunt down An Wenzhe?

1642
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,080
If that's the case,

1643
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,560
then I just want to kill him.

1644
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:22,960
Yes.

1645
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,240
Yes.

1646
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,880
So, in terms of motive,

1647
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,720
it's narrowed down to the two of you.

1648
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,760
You and Ning.

1649
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,840
You said to rule out the two of us.

1650
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,440
But to focus on those two.

1651
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,920
But I think Ning Dengpao is hardly suspicious.

1652
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,640
Don't think that just because you protected me,

1653
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:36,920
Don't think that just because you protected me,

1654
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,720
I'll protect you in return.

1655
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,520
No, listen to me.

1656
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,920
Let him speak first, let him speak first.

1657
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,160
If he heard it,

1658
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,040
the 1:30 recording,

1659
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,920
he would definitely know one thing,

1660
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,160
that this person named An wants to

1661
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,520
send someone into the Killing (Livestream).

1662
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,240
Whether An Wenzhe dies or not,

1663
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,240
as long as I enter this Killing (Livestream),

1664
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,640
my identity will definitely be exposed.

1665
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,680
So his goal

1666
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,000
is just to protect his own identity, right?

1667
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:55,800
So he

1668
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,040
not only wants to kill An Wenzhe,

1669
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,840
he also has to

1670
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,360
make sure he doesn't enter the Killing (Livestream).

1671
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,040
But he did enter—he entered today.

1672
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,680
So he doesn't know anything about all of this.

1673
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,320
He's right.

1674
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,440
He definitely hasn't heard

1675
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,720
the recording from 1:30.

1676
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,200
That's right.

1677
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,720
He wouldn't let himself

1678
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,160
join the live broadcast of the killing.

1679
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:14,520
Yes.

1680
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,240
His identity can't be revealed.

1681
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,880
That's right.

1682
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,960
If you arrange it this way, it can only be me.

1683
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,360
Indeed.

1684
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,120
If we follow just this line of reasoning,

1685
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,480
looking at the motive for murder,

1686
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,080
then it could only be me, bro.

1687
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,280
It really could only be him.

1688
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,200
First of all, just now,

1689
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,400
you thought I was more suspicious.

1690
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,280
Right?

1691
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,080
Yes, if we rule it out this way, it can only be you.

1692
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,920
You think my suspicion—

1693
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,880
Come on, tell us about yourself.

1694
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,080
Who do you think is more suspicious?

1695
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,360
He (looks at Ke An)

1696
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,240
It's because they just said you might be the one

1697
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,480
The one he was talking about

1698
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,320
If I still insist it's you now

1699
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,520
Wouldn't that be strange, right?

1700
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,840
You think he's more suspicious, right?

1701
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,160
If I have to name someone right away

1702
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,400
as the first suspect

1703
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,400
Okay

1704
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,960
I think you are X

1705
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,280
Today, you

1706
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,560
accused both me and him.

1707
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,920
But I think he's safe.

1708
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,080
She accused me first.

1709
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,160
After I cleared myself,

1710
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,520
she then accused him.

1711
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,360
In my mind, between the two of them,

1712
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,880
he is more suspicious.

1713
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,560
So I think you are X.

1714
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,920
I understand what you mean.

1715
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,320
You got it.

1716
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,760
Understood.

1717
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,360
Yes.

1718
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,600
I'm not sure if I remember this correctly.

1719
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,360
Indeed, in your own statements,

1720
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,400
the only one who had two separate movements

1721
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,320
was Bai.

1722
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,400
At one o'clock,

1723
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,080
I went to the second floor.

1724
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,160
At 1:09, I took the doll

1725
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,520
and returned to my room.

1726
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,400
Inside the doll, I found

1727
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,160
the phone and other things.

1728
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:43,960
So I confirmed it was mine.

1729
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,200
Then I decided to check the office again.

1730
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,840
At 1:10, I went to the office.

1731
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,400
No.

1732
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,000
He did too.

1733
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,720
He left at 1:14.

1734
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,400
Why did you go out?

1735
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,560
To call my mentor.

1736
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,480
I was really scared.

1737
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,120
At 1:15,

1738
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,880
I left the dorm and was in the hallway.

1739
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,520
I came out into the hallway.

1740
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
I called my mentor.

1741
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,080
I was in the hallway.

1742
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,000
Bai's two actions

1743
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,440
were both to investigate this person.

1744
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,000
The first time was going to the second floor to check the streaming room.

1745
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,120
The second time was going straight to his office.

1746
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,960
There was a clear investigative intent.

1747
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,920
Yes, investigative intent.

1748
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,600
These two people

1749
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,560
I just suddenly thought of something.

1750
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,520
It's about the killer.

1751
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,760
He must have returned to the scene a second time.

1752
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,080
Right.

1753
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,840
Okay, let's talk about it from the perspective of motive.

1754
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,080
I wouldn't go back to the scene.

1755
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,240
If I did go back to the scene,

1756
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,520
there would only be one thing for me to do.

1757
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,720
Because I already know he wants to kill me.

1758
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,480
Then you would kill him.

1759
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,120
I would kill him.

1760
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,480
So I would definitely never return to the scene a second time.

1761
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,920
So there's a logic like this.

1762
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,240
When you go back a second time, will you kill him?

1763
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,280
I would just take him out.

1764
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,200
That's right, by you returning to the scene a second time,

1765
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,280
if there's a motive,

1766
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,160
he's already gone.

1767
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,440
You're helping to clear him.

1768
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,600
That's right, he's already cleared.

1769
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,160
He's not the culprit.

1770
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,320
I can sense that he's not the culprit.

1771
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,920
Not necessarily.

1772
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,480
When we go back a second time, it must be to kill him.

1773
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,040
Because I know that when I go back, I also have to kill him.

1774
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,280
He also goes back to kill him.

1775
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,960
So it's just between the two of you.

1776
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,800
You will definitely go back a second time.

1777
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,760
Why?

1778
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,800
Because you made a phone call.

1779
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,320
In that call,

1780
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,600
I'll say it one last time.

1781
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,480
I made a phone call.

1782
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,360
What was said in that call?

1783
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,280
I realized

1784
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
An was coming to kill me.

1785
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,000
What was the reason in that call?

1786
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,400
The reason was the old master.

1787
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,760
Did you see someone

1788
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,720
come to the construction site to look for me?

1789
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,520
And what did the old master say?

1790
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,240
He said there was a person with a mole on the left side of his nose.

1791
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,360
That matches An Wenzhe's appearance.

1792
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,760
Then I realized

1793
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,120
it was An Wenzhe coming to investigate me.

1794
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,040
He found out about me.

1795
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,240
When that girl fell,

1796
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,840
I was nearby. He wants to kill me.

1797
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,960
He might be coming for revenge.

1798
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,480
So how could I possibly

1799
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,360
take this step

1800
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,840
and go out for a second action?

1801
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,160
What you just said was

1802
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,520
a mole on the left side of the nose.

1803
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,200
Are you going back to confirm

1804
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,480
whether he really has a mole on the left side of his nose?

1805
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,040
Okay.

1806
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,880
Let's think back a bit further.

1807
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,400
At eight o'clock, when the incident happened.

1808
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,440
The order in which we woke up.

1809
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,080
You woke up first.

1810
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,800
I woke up first.

1811
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,400
You, the culprit, pretended to be unconscious.

1812
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,520
How could I have woken up first?

1813
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,960
I would definitely wait until the first person woke up.

1814
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,160
Only then would I wake up.

1815
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,720
So, it was the second person who woke up.

1816
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,480
I was the second one to wake up, right?

1817
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,800
It doesn't matter who wakes up first; this thing is useless.

1818
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,240
I am the killer.

1819
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,000
I can wake up first and wake everyone up if needed.

1820
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,440
I am the killer.

1821
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,080
I can pretend to be the last one to wake up.

1822
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,480
That's not a reason.

1823
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,360
Makes sense.

1824
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,520
Actually, the three of us aren't clean now.

1825
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,440
He's the cleanest one.

1826
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,120
Who do you think the culprit is?

1827
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,960
I know for sure that I'm not the culprit.

1828
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,000
Bai definitely isn't.

1829
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,480
I can sense that he's not the culprit.

1830
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,160
That's how I feel in my heart.

1831
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,400
You two are the most suspicious.

1832
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,800
So at the beginning,

1833
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,960
I thought he had the strongest motive.

1834
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,040
Even in the game just now,

1835
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,360
he was the first to escape.

1836
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,880
So it's between the two of you.

1837
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,960
Alright, then let's get ready to vote.

1838
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,760
The person I suspect as the culprit is actually

1839
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,840
there is a prerequisite for him to exist.

1840
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,720
He needs to return to the scene a second time.

1841
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,960
So this vote goes to

1842
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,280
He

1843
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,920
Returned to the office a second time.

1844
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,800
The person who went to listen to that recording

1845
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,840
I think it's only him

1846
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,680
The crime was committed by turning the tables

1847
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,720
The real culprit is

1848
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,320
I think he did it to avenge the woman

1849
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,440
The person I suspect is

1850
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,320
Bai Hanzi

1851
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,960
The range of suspects

1852
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,800
It came down to two people.

1853
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,480
One is

1854
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,080
Bai Huanzi.

1855
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,200
The other is Heniba.

1856
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,040
The real culprit is narrowed down to

1857
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,480
I am Bafentang.

1858
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,400
I choose

1859
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,200
Tonight, I will do my best to protect him.

1860
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,440
Tonight, you will do your best to protect him.

1861
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,360
So,

1862
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,480
who is the fool?

1863
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,280
Big idiot.

1864
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:16,600
Alright.

1865
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,200
So who is the one embarrassed?

1866
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,960
I protect him, you protect him.

1867
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,120
So who is the real fool?

1868
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,840
In the end, it's Ke Ankan.

1869
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,400
Let's all take a look.

1870
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,000
No way.

1871
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat.

1872
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,800
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden.

1873
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,880
Next, let's move on to

1874
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,920
Tongcheng Travel.

1875
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,840
The moment of truth is here.

1876
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,160
I'm really nervous.

1877
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,040
It's okay, don't be nervous.

1878
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,160
In today's case,

1879
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,240
the suspects are

1880
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,240
Bai Hanzi,

1881
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,040
He Niba,

1882
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:44,960
Ke Ankan,

1883
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,520
Ning Dengpao.

1884
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,200
Two of them received votes.

1885
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,560
That's Bai and He.

1886
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,840
Just me, right?

1887
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,160
Yeah, it's just the two of us.

1888
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,680
Honestly, buddy, if you're the culprit today,

1889
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,520
you did a pretty good job.

1890
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,880
I'm innocent.

1891
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,120
He played really well today.

1892
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,720
He played exceptionally well today.

1893
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,160
I voted for

1894
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,880
He.

1895
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,560
Xiao X.

1896
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,440
Really?

1897
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:11,320
You really voted for him.

1898
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,320
Just watch.

1899
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,080
Okay.

1900
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,520
Now again...

1901
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,160
What is it?

1902
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,240
She voted for He.

1903
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,440
Why did you vote for He?

1904
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,800
Didn't you vote for He?

1905
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,320
I voted for He.

1906
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,720
Right, so shouldn't you be happy?

1907
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,880
She voted the same as you.

1908
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:25,640
Yeah.

1909
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,720
No, but in my mind, she's X.

1910
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,960
She's X.

1911
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,760
Why would X vote for He?

1912
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,560
Those two...

1913
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,920
Why do you still think I'm the culprit?

1914
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,040
Aren't you the culprit?

1915
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,440
Of course I'm not.

1916
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,160
Let's wait for the final announcement, okay?

1917
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,720
The ones who got votes are...

1918
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,720
Bai Hanzi

1919
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,680
and Heniba

1920
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,920
The number of votes they received is...

1921
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,120
No way, guys.

1922
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,520
Each got three votes.

1923
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,920
The real culprit I voted for today is

1924
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,880
Bai Huanzi

1925
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,080
Bai Huanzi

1926
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,240
The prime suspect is

1927
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:15,920
Bai Huanzi

1928
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,480
The prime suspect is

1929
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,320
Heniba

1930
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,360
This vote goes to

1931
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:20,640
Heniba

1932
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,360
I choose

1933
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:22,880
Heniba

1934
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,680
Each has three votes.

1935
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:29,880
What?

1936
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,400
Each has three votes.

1937
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,280
It's a tie.

1938
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,080
Then we won.

1939
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,840
We won.

1940
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,200
It's a tie, the good guys win.

1941
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,520
A tie means the good guys win.

1942
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,120
In the case of a tie,

1943
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,120
the culprit loses.

1944
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,400
Doesn't matter.

1945
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,960
Doesn't matter.

1946
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,520
I'm a good guy.

1947
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,320
What about you?

1948
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,600
The good guys won, I'm a good guy.

1949
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,800
I knew I won.

1950
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,920
In the case of a tie,

1951
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,720
the player who voted correctly gets the golden key.

1952
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,440
Which player?

1953
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,680
The player who voted correctly.

1954
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,320
Then this rule is correct.

1955
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,080
You can't just win by doing nothing.

1956
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,800
Maybe you voted correctly.

1957
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,360
Yeah, maybe I did.

1958
01:06:59,360 --> 01:06:59,800
Yeah.

1959
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,880
Anyway, it's fifty-fifty now.

1960
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,720
Right? Doesn't matter.

1961
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,760
You're really not X?

1962
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,480
If you're X, then you voted for him.

1963
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,400
She is, she's X.

1964
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,840
Now I'm really doubting myself.

1965
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,200
Old Bai.

1966
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,320
Otherwise, I'm a big fool.

1967
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,600
I really am a fool.

1968
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,280
No.

1969
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,040
The real culprit will be revealed next.

1970
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,040
The real culprit is

1971
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,360
The real culprit is

1972
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,480
Say it

1973
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,520
The real culprit is

1974
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,360
Bai Huanzi

1975
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:42,920
That's right

1976
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,080
I knew it was you

1977
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,560
Let me tell you.

1978
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,040
Fortunately,

1979
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,200
you really

1980
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,680
You almost got me today.

1981
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,440
I kind of want to cry right now.

1982
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,520
You almost got me today.

1983
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,600
I kind of want to cry right now.

1984
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,280
The way you defended him at the end,

1985
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,160
I even thought you were the X in the detective game.

1986
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,640
That's when I realized you were a suspect.

1987
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,880
If there's a motive for returning to the scene a second time,

1988
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,320
it's already gone.

1989
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,200
You're clearing him of suspicion.

1990
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,440
That's right, he's already cleared.

1991
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,120
He's not the culprit.

1992
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,320
I can feel that he's not the culprit.

1993
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,080
Not necessarily.

1994
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,439
I would definitely wait until the first person wakes up

1995
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,560
before I wake up myself.

1996
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,920
So I would be the second to wake up.

1997
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,680
I was the second to wake up, right?

1998
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,600
Who wakes up first doesn't matter.

1999
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,040
I'm the culprit.

2000
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,800
I could wake up first and wake everyone else up too.

2001
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,240
I'm the culprit.

2002
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,880
I could also pretend to be the last one to wake up.

2003
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,279
That's not a reason.

2004
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,120
Makes sense.

2005
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,760
Wait a second.

2006
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,720
How could you let go?

2007
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,399
No, wait.

2008
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,200
I suddenly don't recognize this person anymore.

2009
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,840
Don't cry.

2010
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,720
I'll go back and block him on WeChat.

2011
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,359
I feel like I'm a fool.

2012
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,160
You're not any better, you know.

2013
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,120
Yeah, I'm not.

2014
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,920
Sorry.

2015
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,399
Sorry for making you lose.

2016
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:54,399
Sorry.

2017
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,120
Next,

2018
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
let's have Bai Hanzi announce

2019
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,640
whether there is an X this round

2020
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,120
and who X is.

2021
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,680
Is it Sister Ba?

2022
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,800
It's her, right?

2023
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,880
Come on, you're still here.

2024
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,080
No.

2025
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:12,680
It's not.

2026
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,640
Ba Jie

2027
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,319
You two really make a great pair.

2028
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,080
Today, yes.

2029
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,520
I just wanted everyone to think it was impossible.

2030
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,760
No one guessed in that direction at all.

2031
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,000
Trying to be a little clever like this.

2032
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,720
But it seems like it didn't help at all.

2033
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,439
It was useless.

2034
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,399
Alright, everyone.

2035
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,880
This episode wrapped up perfectly.

2036
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,399
Congratulations, bro.

2037
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,160
You won too.

2038
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,080
But you don't have the key.

2039
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,080
No.

2040
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,200
Ning is the third wheel.

2041
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,200
He always talks to me about it in private.

2042
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,720
You were so impressive today.

2043
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,560
Don't just because

2044
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,040
you're close with him in private

2045
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,960
think you know Bai is the culprit.

2046
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,520
The way he was today, for sure

2047
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,000
I understand him.

2048
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,400
Let's have Ning Dengpao say a few words.

2049
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,200
Here's how I feel today.

2050
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,440
Last time, he trusted me.

2051
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,360
And I tricked him.

2052
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,360
Today, I trusted him from start to finish.

2053
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,000
So I guess that's payback, right?

2054
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,760
Yeah, payback.

2055
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,600
Alright.

2056
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,040
You really trusted him the whole time?

2057
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,840
Yes, from start to finish, because I...

2058
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,480
Because he was acting so normal today.

2059
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,320
He was too relaxed.

2060
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,440
The players who got the golden key today are

2061
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Ke Ankan,

2062
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,360
Heniba,

2063
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,800
and Jin Tangshao.

2064
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,640
Thank you.

2065
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,040
Congratulations to all three.

2066
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,160
Since Heniba, before this round,

2067
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,400
used the "Steal Your Key" card,

2068
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,480
What card?

2069
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,440
The "Steal Your Key" card.

2070
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,320
You choose someone,

2071
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,240
and you can take their golden key for this round.

2072
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,640
You "steal" it from them.

2073
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,320
He chose someone

2074
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,760
and took their golden key.

2075
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,400
The person he snatched from is

2076
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,440
Ba Fen Tang

2077
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,440
You're so smart.

2078
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,920
I'll play it safe, just in case she wins.

2079
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,720
She doesn't have the key today.

2080
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,640
So you snatched it for nothing.

2081
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,240
Right, if I lose,

2082
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:01,640
and she wins,

2083
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,720
then hers is still mine.

2084
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,680
He can get it no matter what.

2085
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,400
He can always get it.

2086
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:04,800
Yeah.

2087
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,000
I'm fine with second place.

2088
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,600
Second place.

2089
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
He picked the wrong person both days.

2090
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,560
Two days in a row.

2091
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,720
Wait, it's getting foggy.

2092
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,080
The eyes have appeared.

2093
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,200
Forty hours have passed.

2094
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,120
Do you still remember who you are?

2095
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,280
Who is it?

2096
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,400
I'm Jin Tangshao.

2097
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,280
I'm Ning Dengpao.

2098
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,240
I'm Ba Fentang.

2099
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,240
I remember now.

2100
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,600
I'm not Jin Tangshao.

2101
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,160
You're not Ba Fentang.

2102
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,480
We went to the team-building event, did you forget?

2103
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,080
Then who are you?

2104
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,680
She's Jin Jing.

2105
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,240
That's right.

2106
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,200
He Li touched Jin Yu.

2107
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,240
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

2108
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,920
We're here!

2109
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,320
You are Bai Yu and Dilraba.

2110
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,120
Jin Jing and Liu Yuning.

2111
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,040
Zhang Linghe and Zhou Keyu.

2112
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,760
You were previously at a team-building event.

2113
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,680
But in fact, you were on a mission during the team-building.

2114
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,600
Your mission

2115
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,720
was to find an extremely dangerous person

2116
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,560
and capture him.

2117
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,800
But you failed the mission the first time.

2118
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,720
There was an explosion.

2119
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,080
Actually, I have already obtained

2120
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,360
a very important clue.

2121
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,280
It's the map you found earlier.

2122
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,720
Several locations marked on it

2123
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,560
are places where this person has appeared before.

2124
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,240
The Tuitian Food Factory is one of them.

2125
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,240
I had you

2126
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,720
reincarnate as six workers at the Tuitian Food Factory

2127
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,040
to investigate this place

2128
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,720
and its connection to the mysterious person.

2129
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,320
But my abilities are limited.

2130
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,680
Within forty hours of your reincarnation,

2131
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,040
you will still lose your memories.

2132
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,680
You will be fully assimilated with the body's memories and instincts.

2133
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,280
Only after forty hours

2134
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,360
can you unlock your own memories.

2135
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,320
Only then can I appear and contact you.

2136
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,440
The mysterious man

2137
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,640
He single-handedly created this murder livestream.

2138
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,040
This mysterious man

2139
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,400
is actually my boss behind the scenes.

2140
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Every time there’s a killing livestream, someone dies.

2141
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,360
All the bodies

2142
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,640
are handled for you.

2143
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,280
That’s right.

2144
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,280
Maybe

2145
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,000
the mysterious man is in this area right now.

2146
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,640
Watching us.

2147
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,320
Yes.

2148
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,440
It’s him.

2149
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,080
Every time the smoke rises,

2150
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,200
it’s not him.

2151
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,280
I forgot to mention,

2152
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,760
bombs have been planted in these locations.

2153
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,440
Although for the next forty hours,

2154
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,120
you will have no memory,

2155
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,440
I still believe

2156
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,480
that with your intelligence,

2157
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,200
you can spot the suspicious places.

2158
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,960
If you can, after forty hours,

2159
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,880
recall these strange locations

2160
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,600
and defuse the bombs to prevent explosions,

2161
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,240
you will be able to save many lives.

2162
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,640
Actually, this case of ours this time

2163
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,320
I think

2164
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,640
I mainly want to tell everyone

2165
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,720
not to think that you

2166
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,960
didn't press that button

2167
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,800
so it has nothing to do with you.

2168
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,600
Actually, if you stand by

2169
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,720
watching, stirring things up, or participating,

2170
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,920
even if you weren't the one

2171
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,880
who pressed the button in the end,

2172
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,520
you are still responsible.

2173
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,560
Today has also been a big warning for me.

2174
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,680
Because it was me

2175
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,080
who ended up causing some people

2176
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,720
to lose a lot of money

2177
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,120
and get involved in such a

2178
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,920
rather unhealthy livestream.

2179
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,960
So in real life,

2180
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,000
I think we must learn to discern

2181
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
our own actions

2182
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,920
and what consequences they might bring.

2183
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,120
For example, in the story,

2184
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,360
the character I play, Ke An,

2185
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,000
unintentionally became

2186
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,880
a distributor of illegal livestream links.

2187
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,120
Indirectly became

2188
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,080
an accomplice to illegal live-streaming crimes.

2189
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,240
Although Ke'an seemed to do it unintentionally,

2190
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,800
he unknowingly encouraged wrongdoing.

2191
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,320
I think it's just like that saying:

2192
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,440
"Do not think any good deed is too small to do,"

2193
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,160
"and do not do evil, even if it seems minor."

2194
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,280
Sometimes, a single action of yours

2195
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,080
or even a selfish thought

2196
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,800
could harm others—

2197
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,520
in the worst case, even cost lives.

2198
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,640
So I think

2199
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,520
you shouldn't think

2200
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,040
that what you do is just a small thing.

2201
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,520
It could have a butterfly effect,

2202
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,560
possibly affecting more people's lives,

2203
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,800
and more people's safety.

2204
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
As good people, we must never let

2205
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,680
evil consume us.

2206
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,600
Just like Ning Dengpao in this film,

2207
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,520
he was a good person at first,

2208
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,520
he invented and created things,

2209
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,920
but he was also swallowed by darkness.

2210
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,360
I think there are many things—

2211
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,640
a cluster of suns brings us warmth and light,

2212
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,880
but a cluster of black holes

2213
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,000
can pull us in.

2214
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,160
We should never become

2215
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,480
the one who gets pulled in.

2216
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,560
Of course, I also want to say to Ning Dengpao,

2217
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,320
many people go through

2218
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,960
bad experiences and hardships.

2219
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,520
But—

2220
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,920
I hope everyone can use a kind of

2221
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,440
positive approach

2222
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,840
to give back to the world

2223
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
instead of returning the dirty water thrown at you

2224
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
by boiling it and throwing it back

2225
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,240
Otherwise, you become just like those who throw dirty water

2226
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,240
and end up the same as them

2227
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,480
The scariest thing for a person is

2228
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,000
becoming the person they dislike

2229
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,440
So I hope we can all keep love in our hearts

2230
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,280
If a livestream is novel or unusual,

2231
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,760
it can attract attention,

2232
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,680
and gain traffic and followers.

2233
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,920
But we also say this is a double-edged sword.

2234
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,920
Some novel streamers,

2235
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,080
as long as they don't break the law or violate regulations,

2236
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,720
can enrich our

2237
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,960
online cultural content offerings.

2238
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
But on the other hand,

2239
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,800
some are vulgar,

2240
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,160
push boundaries,

2241
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,920
cruel,

2242
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,880
or make people uncomfortable.

2243
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,480
This crosses

2244
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,760
the legal red line and bottom line,

2245
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,000
and constitutes illegal or harmful content.

2246
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,600
This needs to be prevented and resisted.

2247
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,120
So our platform,

2248
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,440
if it discovers such issues,

2249
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,960
should promptly

2250
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,240
delete or handle them.

2251
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,000
It may even need to warn the relevant streamer,

2252
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,760
issue a warning,

2253
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,160
or, in serious cases, ban their account.

2254
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,080
Therefore, I want to remind every streamer,

2255
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,400
to work honestly and operate legally.

2256
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,560
In situations like this,

2257
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,120
it is clearly a violation of relevant laws.

2258
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,080
You may face three

2259
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,840
different types of liability.

2260
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,600
The first type is

2261
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,840
infringing on privacy rights and portrait rights.

2262
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,080
You will be held

2263
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,080
civilly liable as stipulated by the Civil Code,

2264
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,000
including stopping the infringement, eliminating the impact,

2265
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,040
making a public apology, and compensating for losses, among others.

2266
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,960
The second situation

2267
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,400
may involve violating

2268
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,160
the Public Security Administration Punishments Law.

2269
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,080
Because peeping or secretly filming

2270
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,200
violates others' privacy,

2271
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,920
you may be fined

2272
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,160
or even subjected to administrative detention.

2273
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,200
The third situation

2274
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,240
may violate the Criminal Law,

2275
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,800
constituting the illegal use

2276
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,920
of eavesdropping or secret recording equipment.

2277
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,960
This, of course, is the most serious offense.

2278
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,800
So, for ordinary people

2279
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,720
if they encounter this kind of situation,

2280
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,160
of course, they should boldly use legal means

2281
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,440
to protect their legitimate rights and interests.

2282
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,840
One way is,

2283
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,840
when you feel your personal privacy

2284
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,240
has been violated,

2285
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,280
you can call the police.

2286
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,960
As for the second option,

2287
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,240
if you have relevant evidence,

2288
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,080
you can also file a civil lawsuit in court

2289
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,760
to assert your right to privacy and so on

2290
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,680
if it has been infringed upon.

2291
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,200
Pirate Mansion

2292
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:43,840
There used to be a legendary female pirate.

2293
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,280
There used to be a legendary female pirate.

2294
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,880
It was renovated from Madam Tui's ancestral home.

2295
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,480
I know about Madam Tui.

2296
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:48,880
And then...

2297
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,480
Don’t say things you shouldn’t.

2298
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,280
In a moment, the bell will ring

2299
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,160
and the participants will recreate

2300
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,400
the legendary resonance between Lady Tui San and the sea.

2301
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,440
Let me take a look

2302
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,760
to see if your outfits resemble those from back then.

2303
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,360
What do we have to do with those days?

2304
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Once the immersive exhibition begins

2305
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,840
it cannot be stopped.

2306
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,080
The mansion is very noisy.

2307
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,360
This exhibition is very quiet.

2308
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,400
We all think it's noisy.

2309
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,560
Others think it's quiet.

2310
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,320
When we left

2311
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,560
the boss was still in that room.

2312
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,640
He probably left not long after.

2313
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,920
After he left, we kept eating for a while.

2314
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,480
No, that's not right.

2315
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,480
I've forgotten.

2316
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,480
I'm really scared.

2317
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,520
Baizhihua seems to have remembered something else.

2318
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,880
Shenhundian Island.

2319
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,440
This island is Shenhundian Island.

2320
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,400
Ancestral pirate outfit.

2321
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,080
Does everyone look like they did back then?

2322
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:40,720
Dead.

2323
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,480
He wanted him to die in the water.

2324
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,960
The captain knew before setting sail.

2325
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,000
A familiar method of committing the crime.

2326
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,320
All the candles are lit.

2327
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,520
Follow the candles.

2328
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,760
We're about to board the ship.

2329
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,560
Such a big orange.

2330
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,560
It doesn't sound tasty at all.

2331
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,160
You ate it, didn't you, Dami?

2332
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,360
Good taste.

2333
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,720
Strawberry cake.

2334
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,120
After leaving Tan Qian's office,

2335
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,880
I quickly went to the workshop and ate a piece of aloe.

2336
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,720
Then I found the

2337
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,080
strong sleep spray I discovered yesterday.

2338
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,920
I brought it back to the dorm.

2339
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,680
I also prepared a small knife.

2340
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,360
I lay on the bed and pretended to be drugged.

2341
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,440
I really did go to his house for an acting class once.

2342
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,320
Really?

2343
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,000
If you start an acting class, I want to join too.

2344
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2345
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,640
You're the number actor.

2346
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:38,840
If you were the "culprit,"

2347
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,720
who would you choose as X?

2348
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,640
I'd still choose Bafentang.

2349
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,120
Why?

2350
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,480
Just that one time.

2351
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,000
Who would you choose?

2352
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,920
I'm not telling you.

2353
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,640
If I were X, I definitely wouldn't help you.

2354
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,080
Then let's all scratch our heads, okay?

2355
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:49,960
Let's all scratch our heads.

2356
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:50,920
Everyone scratch your heads.

2357
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,360
I told you, you're all scared now.

2358
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,400
And you're still confused.

2359
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,760
Three, two, one.

2360
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,000
Actually, this works.

2361
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,440
We can take a photo from different angles.

2362
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,160
Right.

2363
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,360
Legs are 8.5 meters long.
