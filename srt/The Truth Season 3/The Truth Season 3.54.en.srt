1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,200
The story of She Man is gradually coming into focus.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,680
The story of She Man is gradually coming into focus.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,960
The detectives have been reborn multiple times.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,760
That ever-present mist and the deadly explosions

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,960
all originated from his hands.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,680
Now that She Man is dead,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,200
everyone's memories are starting to return in fragments.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,440
But something is still off.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,040
She is already dead.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,680
So why is all of this still happening?

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,080
What stories remain untouched?

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
The true identities of the detectives

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,240
what are they, really?

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,160
What kind of pasts are they hiding?

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,280
The final scene of Detective City is shrouded in mist.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,480
It is waiting to be revealed.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,400
After an initial investigation,

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,800
the people involved in this case have been revealed.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,280
It's just that I feel this She

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,040
Why did you raise your hand so quickly?

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
How about that timing?

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,880
Is he a free man? He is now.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,040
You people...

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,600
Hurry, catch him!

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,320
Hurry up!

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,400
He was the first one to be handcuffed.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Handcuff him first.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
Bro, please, hurry, I'm begging you.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,960
We come from the underground.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,800
We do rap.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,840
Underground.

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,080
Waking up in the fog.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,400
Holding you.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,880
Angry now.

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
I want revenge.

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
You want revenge.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,520
Yes, that's me.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,760
She father.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,880
Discussing the plot, talking about the case.

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm really speechless.

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,240
When you win Best Actor,

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,320
can you please not forget

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
that you once had friends like us?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,320
Yeah.

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,400
Can you, on that stage,

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
thank us?

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,000
He Li Mo Jin Yu.

48
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm really speechless.

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Does the She clan's password need to be used

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
to enter it?

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,880
That future world

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
is actually caused by people today.

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,840
That's right.

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,720
So they want to fight for

55
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,040
the present

56
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,120
and this place.

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,360
He actually died at that time.

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,919
But the organization members successfully used

59
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,400
and brought him back to life.

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,280
So

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,040
does that mean

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,360
he is a core member of the organization?

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,280
If they know about each other,

64
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,920
it's possible.

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,600
It's possible.

66
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,880
If he is the killer,

67
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,200
he would have asked me to add him.

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
Add us.

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
It's impossible for us to be together.

70
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, that's what I meant just now.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,360
Yes.

72
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,280
There will definitely be a big boss today.

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm telling you, I only remember Diba.

74
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
I can't remember Li and Re.

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
You haven't woken up yet, have you?

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
Wake up a bit.

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Wake up.

78
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,520
ch ü ǎn

79
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,720
Who is this?

80
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
Alright, kids, let's go!

81
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,720
Okay.

82
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
Let's go.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Come on.

84
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,120
Kids, come put on your socks.

85
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,880
Okay.

86
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Pick a pair of non-slip socks for yourself.

87
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,800
She's already different after putting on the pants.

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,720
Squatting.

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,200
Ribbit.

90
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
I remember now.

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,200
This one doesn't match.

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,680
So,

93
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
So, right.

94
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,960
Right.

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Over there.

96
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
That upper corner.

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
There, over there.

98
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,840
This.

99
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,120
This.

100
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
Should we squat down and take a look?

101
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Under that table.

102
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Found it.

103
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,040
There's more in the back.

104
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
There's one over there.

105
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
There's one over there, it's purple.

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,120
Come, cut it.

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,400
Over there.

108
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,960
Let's stack them up.

109
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,040
Just stack them foot to foot like this.

110
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
Among the smart kids,

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,040
Is there one?

112
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
Wasn't he killed by me?

113
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,200
Then everyone caught him.

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,080
And then my throat

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
was ruined.

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,320
Wait, is this the right order?

117
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,240
But shouldn't we

118
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,320
find out what he wants to do

119
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,080
and then burn him at the end?

120
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,280
Doesn't matter, just get rid of him.

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Kill him first, then talk.

122
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
Right, because you regretted it a lot yesterday.

123
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Wait.

124
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,840
That's right.

125
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
And you even got caught.

126
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,520
No.

127
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
You're a murderer.

128
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
But it doesn't matter who you kill.

129
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
It's all the same.

130
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,800
You joined them to talk about me.

131
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,920
No, I'm comforting you.

132
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm saying you should confess and accept punishment.

133
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm on top, I'm too slippery.

134
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,360
No, he can't touch you.

135
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,920
Because the four of us will

136
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,200
No.

137
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,280
kneel firmly on the ground

138
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
and beg them not to drag us away.

139
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,080
Isn't that your...

140
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
This puppy.

141
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,200
Okay, you three go rest over there.

142
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
This way.

143
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,040
You stay here for me.

144
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
Her expression

145
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,760
Okay

146
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,640
Stop speaking in She language

147
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm giving you one last chance

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Tell me

149
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,560
Who was just suddenly

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,000
You seem more like you were

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Like this

152
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
She

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,600
Why did you turn around

154
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,640
He called She

155
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Wait a second

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,800
You know he's calling you

157
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,320
There's no way to clear your name now

158
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
Is She causing trouble

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Who did you think was causing trouble just now

160
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm not sure you're playing that well

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Why are you always with me

162
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,000
You're pretty happy, aren't you

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,160
I turned my suspicion toward the eldest

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,360
To them at that time, we were just

165
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,880
So it's what we're experiencing now

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
It's all these things

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,480
We have a strategy now

168
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,120
Go ahead

169
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,640
Can we handle both at the same time

170
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
We can narrow down the scope

171
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
If we get it wrong this round

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,440
Then we are

173
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,280
If we get it right this round

174
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,960
At least we are

175
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Right

176
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,920
Only then can we

177
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
Doing this will give us a better chance of winning

178
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
That's right

179
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
If we're going by seniority,

180
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
it seems you really are the eldest.

181
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
Big brother, the boss.

182
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
You've wanted to be the boss for years.

183
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,440
What did we do?

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,920
I want to ask, what did we do?

185
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,600
You all bowed at a ninety-degree angle.

186
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Okay, I'll go up first.

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,960
Okay.

188
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Alright.

189
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,640
Move a bit further in.

190
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
A little more.

191
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,880
A bit more.

192
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,240
A little more.

193
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,280
You already embarrassed me just now.

194
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
I'll give you one more chance.

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Voluntarily.

196
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,240
Here's the thing.

197
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,360
Look.

198
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
If I make a fuss, my brother will show up.

199
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840
That's how it is.

200
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,000
Right now, we are

201
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
which means

202
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,240
Um...

203
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
So our goal

204
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
should be to save these people.

205
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,320
If we want to shut this down

206
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,760
we need to, right now,

207
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
guess correctly who is

208
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
it'll explode immediately.

209
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
Wait, there's a phone here.

210
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,680
I think its password should be

211
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,400
Mr. She is so cunning.

212
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,760
Why do you call him Mr. She?

213
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,840
That's Miss She.

214
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,480
He's just called Mr. She.

215
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,160
No, he's called Mr. She.

216
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,000
You're arguing with a computer.

217
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,920
You're arguing with a pair of eyes.

218
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah.

219
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,400
Your eyes are bothering me.

220
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,360
There are words.

221
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,680
What?

222
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Words.

223
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,400
What?

224
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Verification cabinet.

225
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,360
You solve it first, no rush.

226
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,920
Okay, it's open.

227
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
It's open.

228
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
Impressive, really impressive.

229
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
I am.

230
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,120
We don't know yet.

231
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,080
What the plan is.

232
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Elimination plan.

233
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,880
What is the plan?

234
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
Will lead to

235
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,640
killing them?

236
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,400
That must be targeting

237
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,440
the plan.

238
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,520
I remember him.

239
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,000
His name is Zhou Keyu.

240
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Yes, my name is Zhou Ke(yu).

241
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
His name is Zhou Ke(yu).

242
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,920
So we have to fight with three strong guys.

243
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
No, it's really not easy to fight.

244
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
To be honest.

245
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,640
Wait, who is restraining him?

246
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,480
What are you doing?

247
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,480
Who is restraining him?

248
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,080
He's a free man now.

249
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
He didn't handcuff me.

250
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,640
You like this.

251
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,560
You still can't not be handcuffed.

252
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
I don't have this memory.

253
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,880
I don't remember this.

254
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,920
You can't recall this right now.

255
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll just shoot.

256
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
The younger brother has already relied on his own abilities

257
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
to win first place with the golden key.

258
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,400
So talented at a young age.

259
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,320
We can be

260
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,920
the ones.

261
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
If it's "She,"

262
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
he has to write his name.

263
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,600
But what's written here is

264
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
a b c d e.

265
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,520
a b c d e.

266
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,159
We've already figured it out.

267
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,600
We've already made some progress.

268
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,000
Even if the three of you figure it out,

269
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,039
we've figured it out too.

270
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,159
We can still choose.

271
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,600
So go ahead and try boldly.

272
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Because this is the plan.

273
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,000
Why do you say that?

274
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,840
Do you know why?

275
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,080
And

276
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,400
The point where the real positions differ is very simple.

277
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,360
It's about wanting to take over the whole world.

278
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,040
Then what you said is right.

279
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,640
Makes sense.

280
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes.

281
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,080
First question

282
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Answer the question based on the picture

283
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,160
What is it? You definitely know

284
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Every injustice has its perpetrator

285
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,160
Every debt has its owner

286
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,000
Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its owner

287
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
This is Jin Jing

288
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,240
This is Reba

289
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
This is Ning Ge

290
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,680
Right?

291
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes

292
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,760
There are three more

293
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,160
This can only be me

294
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
The two above

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
This is Jiawei

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,560
Yes

297
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,080
Yes

298
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,080
Third question

299
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,200
Croaking frog

300
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
Croak

301
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
What are we supposed to remember?

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
Can anyone even remember this?

303
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,440
I was just focused on my own jumping

304
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
I couldn't even take care of myself

305
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,200
How could I look after them too?

306
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,720
That means the answer is wrong, you have to shoot

307
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,600
That means the answer is wrong, you have to shoot, okay?

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,360
Then C is definitely wrong

309
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
So it's between B and D?

310
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,160
D

311
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,200
Excellent

312
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,640
Please choose one picture from the drawings

313
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,880
Say who drew it and what the scene is

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
Based on the following pictures

315
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
name Jin Jing and Bai Yu

316
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,000
as the answer to the current question

317
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Pig

318
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,560
Did Bai Yu not understand any of that?

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor.

320
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,720
Right

321
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,960
Please identify, in the following six pictures,

322
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,320
which eyes belong to which player

323
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
The first one is Jin Jing's

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,880
Then mine

325
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,760
The one next to it is mine

326
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
Below, on the left, is Zhang Linghe's

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,000
On the right is Zhou Keyu

328
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,000
The bottom left one is

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,640
Liu Yuning

330
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
Then it's Bai Yu

331
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, that's correct

332
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,400
That one

333
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,080
Ba

334
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,800
Is that Ba?

335
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
What was that again?

336
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm the one reading the newspaper

337
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,240
The one jumping is Bai Yu

338
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,680
That tiger jump

339
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
The one holding the duck is Jin Jing

340
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,040
The one with something on their head is Zhang Linghe

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,920
The one holding the yellow flag is

342
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
The one with the red flag is

343
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
The one surrendering is

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
It's one of those two

345
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Zhou Keyu

346
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
The one wearing a hat is Liu Yuning

347
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,400
Its ears are different, right?

348
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,560
You can't choose your own drawing

349
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,160
Except for the one I drew myself

350
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
Among the other drawings, there's one of someone eating

351
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,760
You can tell everyone is eating

352
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,400
But I don't know who drew it

353
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,240
And this one is a swimming pool

354
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
Because I thought

355
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,760
only Zhou Keyu stayed behind at that time,

356
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,480
so this should be his drawing.

357
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
Congratulations, you won the game.

358
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,840
Let me try this one.

359
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,520
Okay.

360
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
Luckily, we got them all right.

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,880
The first question is

362
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,960
Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor.

363
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,880
Number one is mine, right?

364
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,240
Number two is Reba.

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Number three is Zhang Linghe.

366
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
Number four is Zhou Keyu.

367
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
Number six is Bai Yu.

368
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,920
Number five is Liu Yuning.

369
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,280
That's right.

370
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm sweating.

371
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,000
I really don't remember this.

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to shoot.

373
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,160
Please don't explode.

374
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,640
If it doesn't explode, it doesn't count as me losing, right?

375
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
Yes, that's right.

376
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,120
The roadblock is

377
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,680
Let me shoot one more time.

378
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Roadblock, I'm an idiot.

379
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,120
D.

380
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,240
Correct answer.

381
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,640
This is the last question.

382
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
Number one was drawn by Bai Yu.

383
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
He drew us while we were eating.

384
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
We were deducing the culprit there.

385
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,200
Congratulations, correct answer.

386
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,520
Got it.

387
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,760
Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor.

388
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Correct answer.

389
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
This one's done.

390
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
These eyes are hard to recognize.

391
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,680
The first one on the left is Jin Jing.

392
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,840
Then to the right

393
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,200
The first on the right is Reba

394
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,560
Then the second on the left is

395
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,880
Zhang Linghe

396
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
The second on the right is

397
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,320
Zhou Keyu

398
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,880
Then the lower left is Liu Yuning

399
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
The lower right is Bai Yu

400
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes, good, we got the second question right

401
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,600
Do you still remember?

402
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,960
Then sorry about that

403
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
Here comes a shot

404
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,760
Okay

405
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Alright

406
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,800
The safety bucket should be me, right?

407
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,120
Then the metal bucket is He

408
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
The little duck is

409
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
Jin Jing, right?

410
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
The one that's jumping is

411
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,200
The jumping one is Bai Yu

412
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,839
Then the newspaper is Ba

413
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
So the one holding the flag must be Keyu

414
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,280
Right?

415
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
Because I assigned these to them

416
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
I think so, I remember at the time

417
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,240
Which one is the logo of Tuitian Food Factory?

418
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,800
D

419
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
You really have been watching the show carefully, right?

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
I'll choose the fourth one.

421
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
The fourth one looks so sloppy at first glance.

422
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,600
That must match Bai Yu's personality.

423
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Right?

424
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,320
Wrong answer.

425
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,400
Next one.

426
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,360
Zhang Linghe's drawing.

427
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,520
Zhang Linghe.

428
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,200
That guy is also pretty easygoing.

429
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Last shot.

430
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,040
Three, two...

431
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Alright, congratulations.

432
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
You've passed our challenge this time.

433
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,040
Let me take a look at the picture.

434
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
I can't see it clearly.

435
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
I don't know.

436
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,720
Round oil.

437
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,880
Round oily head, round oily hair.

438
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,960
What kind of word is that?

439
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,640
Round oil.

440
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
The day after I finish recording,

441
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
I forget what I recorded in the previous episode.

442
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
I'll type it.

443
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,720
Typed.

444
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
The first one is Jin Jing.

445
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,320
The second one is Reba.

446
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,200
Just horizontally.

447
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,160
The third one is Zhang Linghe.

448
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,840
The fourth one is Zhou Keyu.

449
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
The fifth one is Liu Yuning.

450
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,920
The sixth one is Bai Yu.

451
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Correct.

452
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,360
Right?

453
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,280
Okay.

454
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,120
I remember I was the third one, the one with the bucket.

455
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,080
Brother Bai was the fifth one, the one who jumped.

456
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,120
I really don't remember the rest.

457
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,920
Alright, go ahead.

458
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,520
Lost.

459
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,240
Lost.

460
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
I know this one.

461
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,480
Dull.

462
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
Senile dementia.

463
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,880
Okay, that's incorrect.

464
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,800
Go ahead, shoot.

465
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,640
The correct answer is "Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor."

466
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,840
First, this one is definitely Reba.

467
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Right?

468
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,200
This one.

469
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,640
Right.

470
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,320
Okay.

471
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,160
Then,

472
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,320
Next,

473
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,520
This should be me.

474
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,560
Right.

475
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,120
Then,

476
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
This is Jin Jing.

477
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,000
Okay, that's one, two, three.

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Then this one is...

479
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,680
This is Bai Yu.

480
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,280
This is Ning.

481
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,240
This is Zhang Linghe.

482
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,760
Right.

483
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,880
Correct answer.

484
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
Question three.

485
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Question four.

486
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
The flag is me.

487
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,120
Right.

488
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
The bucket is that one.

489
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,920
The bucket is Linghe.

490
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,120
And the duck is Jin Jing.

491
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
The pole is Bai Yu.

492
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,160
The newspaper is Reba.

493
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,760
(The one holding the roadblock) is Ning, right.

494
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,640
Correct answer.

495
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,120
C

496
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
Incorrect answer.

497
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
The correct answer is D.

498
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,520
Alright, then the game is over.

499
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,280
What is this?

500
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,880
Heyuan claypot rice.

501
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
It's served in small bowls.

502
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
Then I'll have this one.

503
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,680
Okay.

504
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
I want this one.

505
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
I have main character luck.

506
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,960
Alright.

507
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,560
What could this be?

508
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,240
Looking forward to it.

509
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
Let's look forward to it.

510
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
I want that Jiangxi dish.

511
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Recommend Delicious Canteen.

512
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Jiangxi stir-fry, right?

513
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes.

514
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Wait a moment.

515
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,120
I want the ancient city dessert.

516
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Or the super fresh claypot rice.

517
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,520
Crispy iron spoon rice cake.

518
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,800
I want to try it too.

519
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,360
Okay, iron spoon rice cake.

520
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you.

521
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
Then let's have this rice noodles.

522
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,800
Hakka rice noodles.

523
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,320
Alright.

524
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,800
Okay.

525
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,320
Alright.
