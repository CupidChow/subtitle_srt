1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,640
Season three is finished recording.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,480
Lao Bai, do you feel a bit reluctant to leave?

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,760
Reluctant? I'm very reluctant.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960
You've already started your break.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,840
Found a retirement home.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,240
Going to stay there for a while.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,520
Thanks to all the staff and teachers.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,920
And all the dear teachers.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Looks great.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,600
Looks great.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,400
Looks great.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,480
Over two hundred expressions.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
My voice is hoarse today.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
You cried so much here yesterday.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
A down-and-out returnee from overseas.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,160
The aloof young lady.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,640
Sit for a while, come on.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,960
I don't believe you all can pass this round.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,520
Show us the replay.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,120
Picking up your own child.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
Jiawei just got

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
pulled up into the air, right?

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,000
Lifted up.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
His belly button showed.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
Don't catch a cold, keep your stomach warm.

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,800
Slim waist.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,600
When this episode airs,

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
we'll just clip this part out.

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
If you don't help,

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,760
we'll clip it and post it in the group.

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
It's the most expensive meal to treat.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
Send us a big red envelope first.

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,680
Can you help me turn off the light?

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,040
The light inside.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
I was stunned by how handsome he is.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,760
Can I take a photo with you, Bai Yu?

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,360
I won't take a photo with you.

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Please, I'm begging you.

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,520
Hurry up.

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,000
Help me take a picture of him, quick.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm speechless.

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Take one like those authoritative family photos.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
Authoritative family.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,880
Authoritative family.

45
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Make it look like I'm his dad.

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
I knew he was going to say that.

47
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Make it look like he's my good eldest son.

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,560
Alright, I'll put on glasses too.

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360
So handsome!

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,680
So handsome!

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,919
Authoritative.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Today I'm the detective, everyone.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
Really?

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,240
There's nothing going on today, and you're the detective?

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Let's take a photo, the three of us.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,200
Come on.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Then you two sit.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
I'll just stand behind you, come on.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,440
Alright, big bro.

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Then let's do it over here.

61
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,760
Alright, big bro.

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Which camera angle should we look at?

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Just look at each one in turn.

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,120
Come on, okay, that's good.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
Why are you doing the peace sign?

66
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,880
Mind your own business.

67
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,280
Where did that peace sign come from?

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,200
There's no killer, so what's the point of investigating?

69
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Impressive.

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,520
I just don't know if it's because you've grown,

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
or if I overestimated you.

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,080
No, if we go by the rules,

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
in this situation,

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,600
with no killer among us,

75
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,240
one of us

76
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
must be the big boss.

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Who says so?

78
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,280
Wasn't it like this in the first season?

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Then I'm the big boss this season.

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Impossible.

81
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
That info from yesterday was definitely trying to trick us.

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,200
You can tell it's a trick at a glance.

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
That's right, it's him.

84
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,080
He's the big boss.

85
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,760
He's definitely trying to fool us.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,520
It really is him.

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
You're really good at reading people, I'm telling you.

88
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
You're especially sharp this season.

89
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
You see right through everything at a glance.

90
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,640
Record that for me.

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
In the end, I'll have him play it on repeat every day.

92
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Start pretending to be crazy and clueless, go ahead.

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,400
So, what should we bet on today?

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Do you dare to bet?

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,880
Start pretending to be crazy and clueless, go ahead.

96
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,360
I bet with him yesterday.

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,040
He didn't dare to bet.

98
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,600
Take out what we use for team building.

99
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,840
It's about who pays for this meal.

100
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Let's go to Beijing and find the best place to eat.

101
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,560
That's fine, I can pay for the groceries.

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,760
Groceries? You're only covering the cost price.

103
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,600
Didn't you say you'd cook for everyone?

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
Season three is finished recording.

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Lao Bai, do you feel a bit reluctant to leave?

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
Reluctant? I'm very reluctant.

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
I can tell.

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
He's definitely telling the truth right now.

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
He told me something.

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
He said, "All good things must come to an end."

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,360
That's right.

112
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
This farewell

113
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,760
is for a better reunion next time.

114
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,200
Isn't that so?

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Can you teach me how to whistle?

116
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,040
Whistling is all about natural talent.

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,320
I really don't want to talk to you.

118
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Seriously, whistling, I...

119
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Why do you need someone to teach you?

120
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Just practice by yourself.

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
Bai, where are you going tomorrow? Sanya?

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,800
Yeah.

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Sanya.

124
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,800
Yeah.

125
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
He's been recuperating over there lately.

126
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
Who's recuperating?

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,840
He's recuperating. He's been in seclusion lately.

128
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
You've already started recuperating.

129
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
Found a nursing home.

130
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,320
Staying there for a while.

131
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Old man, can't help it.

132
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean?

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,760
You call me "bro" every day.

134
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,920
Then you say you're an old man.

135
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm the old man bro.

136
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,120
Heh, so where are you going back to?

137
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm going back to Hangzhou.

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
What month do you join the crew?

139
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,840
It's still a while away.

140
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,520
So what are you doing in the meantime?

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm going out for a bit.

142
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
Yeah, I'm going out with him.

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
You're just tagging along, they're not taking you.

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I found a nursing home too.

145
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,280
Heh, aren't you a bit reluctant today?

146
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
We're wrapping up filming today.

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,880
It's not time yet.

148
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,800
It's not time to cry yet.

149
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah.

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,600
If there's a final boss,

151
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
Jin Jing is the final boss.

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,040
And she won in the end.

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Why in the last episode

154
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
there's no culprit, no investigation?

155
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,280
It's just giving you a chance to turn over a new leaf.

156
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
No.

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
You have to turn over a new leaf.

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,560
I want to keep being a wanderer to the end.

159
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,040
Never look back.

160
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,400
Alright, go ahead.

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,440
This...

162
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,360
Back from studying abroad.

163
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,720
A little.

164
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Ask her if she's the big boss.

165
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,800
You're still doing this?

166
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,760
No, now she's called Dilraba.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Dilraba?

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
How could she be the big boss?

169
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
Definitely not.

170
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
Everyone, we're about to start.

171
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,360
Thank you to all the staff and teachers.

172
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,280
We can move out to the front hall.

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,280
Thank you to all the staff and teachers.

174
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,720
Everyone, please exit, dear teachers.

175
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,840
This "dear teacher" thing is really popular now.

176
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
Dear teacher, you should film it like this.

177
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Looks good.

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Looks good.

179
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Looks good.

180
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
Over two hundred expressions.

181
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,160
You don't understand anything.

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
And you say you're good to me.

183
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
You're not good to me at all.

184
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
Put it in your bag.

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
My voice is hoarse today.

186
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
You cried here yesterday.

187
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
Lying on the floor.

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,840
How is it?

189
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Have you recovered?

190
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
I can't recover.

191
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,080
It's a lifelong wound.

192
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,280
Really?

193
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
It left you with lifelong trauma?

194
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,160
Yeah.

195
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Did you lose your voice?

196
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,680
Yeah, I went home and cried my eyes out.

197
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,440
I cried all night.

198
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,200
That's so rough.

199
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,280
How about you? The fever?

200
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,640
It's gone.

201
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,000
It's gone.

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
It's down to thirty-seven degrees.

203
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
You finally broke the fever.

204
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Their clothes look so nice.

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
I want one too.

206
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay.

207
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,480
I even gave one as a gift.

208
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,040
I'll give you mine.

209
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,680
Didn't see it.

210
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,360
He doesn't care about you at all.

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,760
Wear it secretly when you get home.

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
When you go to sleep at home.

213
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Wrap yourself in it and hug it.

214
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
What the heck?

215
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,480
I'll use this shirt as pajamas.

216
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,600
You better.

217
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,640
Seriously, you better.

218
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
You guys pick first.

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,880
These are toe socks.

220
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,720
Why are you taking your socks off?

221
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
I want to see if you'll take them off.

222
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Toe socks.

223
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
Don't take them off, Zhang Linghe.

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
I didn't even realize they were toe socks.

225
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,520
You need to wear non-slip socks.

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,840
Right.

227
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
Where's the big toe on this?

228
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
Which one is the big toe?

229
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
The big one is the big toe.

230
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
The small one is the little toe.

231
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,200
The ones in the middle are...

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Is there anything else besides socks?

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
Clothes.

234
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,680
On the right.

235
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
It seems...

236
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,840
What do you mean?

237
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
These are for girls, right?

238
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
Let a girl try them on.

239
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,720
Got it.

240
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Girls aren't playing.

241
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,360
No way.

242
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,080
We'll just leave you here.

243
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,919
Why does it keep pushing me?

244
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,679
I'll hold it for you, I'll support you.

245
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,200
Miss

246
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,520
You all still need to change clothes later.

247
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
So change your socks first.

248
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,720
Because later you might need to

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
do the splits or something like that.

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
The splits.

251
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,160
The splits, huh.

252
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Can you do the splits, bro?

253
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,720
The splits.

254
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
So let the girls do the splits, we'll do something else.

255
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,800
You do a handstand.

256
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
Sure, no problem.

257
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,400
How about you put your pants on first?

258
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,320
We'll go out.

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,960
Wait, there are cameras here.

260
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,280
There are cameras everywhere, man, and you still want to go out?

261
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Then maybe I'll just put my pants on by myself.

262
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Better than with you all here.

263
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,280
It'll look better if I put my pants on alone.

264
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,520
I'll go out to change.

265
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
Today really feels like we're kids.

266
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,560
So we're even learning pinyin.

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,120
Do you want white or black ones?

268
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Black.

269
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Thanks.

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
These socks are so uncomfortable.

271
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Wait a second.

272
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
My sock here

273
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,960
doesn't seem quite right.

274
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
The number of toes is wrong, right?

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
Do I look good wearing it like this?

276
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
You look good no matter what.

277
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,560
All done.

278
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Now we're going to play a game with the kids.

279
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
Now we're going to play a game with the kids.

280
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,560
Okay.

281
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
We're playing "Drop the Handkerchief," right?

282
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
They're all starting to learn from pinyin.

283
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,720
Well, isn't that something.

284
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,800
Today is a kindergarten gathering.

285
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Where are we going?

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,600
I don't know, let's just go.

287
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,120
My bag.

288
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
My bag.

289
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,480
I'll come back, baby.

290
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,880
This is so embarrassing.

291
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
Back from studying abroad and down on my luck.

292
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
My high heels.

293
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,600
Come, have a seat.

294
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
The aloof young lady.

295
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,600
Sit down, come on.

296
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
This is too hard.

297
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Bro, let me make you some tea.

298
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Here you go, bro.

299
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,840
No.

300
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,440
We really got wiped out.

301
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
So I think it's pointless.

302
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,720
Our "lockdown" is kind of...

303
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,160
This game is...

304
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
I think this game is meaningless.

305
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
In the face of absolute power,

306
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,960
No.

307
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Nothing you do matters.

308
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
There's only one way left.

309
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,480
Block the door.

310
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
The door can't be blocked.

311
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,120
How do you block the door?

312
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,640
It opens outward.

313
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
Block it from the outside.

314
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,560
If you block it from outside, he'll just push it open.

315
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,120
Block it here.

316
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,520
Then someone will never be able to get in.

317
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Yeah, use a wooden something.

318
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
If he really wants to get in,

319
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,480
This thing

320
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
can be broken.

321
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
You can't lock them out either.

322
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Yeah, you can't lock them out.

323
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,800
Let's try stepping on it first.

324
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,600
Take a look at the structure inside.

325
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
You can't hold it from the inside.

326
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
See for yourself.

327
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,400
There's nothing to pull inside.

328
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,280
So it's possible something is blocking it from the outside.

329
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,480
Just find a rope and tie it up.

330
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
I think we have to create an obstacle for him.

331
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,840
If we let him get in front of us,

332
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
it'll be too difficult.

333
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,080
Shoelaces.

334
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
Shoelaces, right, I was just thinking the same.

335
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
You mean tie a hundred knots in it?

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Yes.

337
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,280
One pair of scissors.

338
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,800
He has scissors.

339
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,080
He doesn't know.

340
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,040
He doesn't know.

341
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,520
We have mics.

342
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,840
They came out from here.

343
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,560
From here.

344
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,920
They all came from the control room.

345
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,640
Really?

346
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
No, this is for the camera crew.

347
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,800
They come out from here.

348
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,400
They came out from here.

349
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,760
Right.

350
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,680
So if we block this, will it be fine?

351
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
What about this flowerpot?

352
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,160
Trip them up.

353
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
Don't forget, you're Jin Jing.

354
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,160
I am Jin Jing herself.

355
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Yes, Jin Jing herself.

356
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
You still have to be an artist.

357
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay.

358
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
You can't have any scandals.

359
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,840
Can't, right.

360
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,760
We still need six people.

361
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,480
Come on, let's go in first.

362
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,400
Come in.

363
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't blow directly at that.

364
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah, you just got over a fever.

365
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,280
At first, I still had some strength.

366
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,160
But later, my legs lost all their strength.

367
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,920
There's no way you could have any strength.

368
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,720
He's sweating so much it's dripping.

369
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
Is anyone touching up their makeup?

370
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,880
Touch up your makeup at the door.

371
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,080
Are you guys even human?

372
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,440
I don't believe any of you can pass this round.

373
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,120
We've all played it before.

374
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,920
We've all played.

375
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,520
Impossible.

376
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
Show us the replay.

377
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
We need to include this segment

378
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,640
in our work video log.

379
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,480
Give us this footage.

380
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,880
Give us the footage.

381
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,080
You guys come in and play a round now.

382
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
We have to catch every single one.

383
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
Who had their earring pulled off?

384
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,000
Who got hit with a hook punch?

385
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
You all played it yourselves, right?

386
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,360
Of course.

387
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,240
Let me see the footage.

388
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,080
Okay.

389
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,320
Now go find it for me.

390
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,160
Like picking up kids from kindergarten after school.

391
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,240
Now everyone is at this entrance

392
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,520
picking up their own kids.

393
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,520
So scary.

394
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
It's really scary.

395
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,200
Fighting, free sparring.

396
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,200
I know.

397
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Then let's...

398
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
I found a problem.

399
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Stop finding problems.

400
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
Whose earring is this?

401
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,360
From a third-person perspective,

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,880
Sit here for a while, it's cooler here.

403
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,360
What do you mean?

404
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,200
It's too stuffy outside.

405
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, it's just cooler here.

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,560
Jiawei just got

407
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
pulled up into the air, right?

408
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
He was lifted up.

409
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,160
Yes.

410
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Thank you.

411
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,120
Lao Bai.

412
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,920
What is it?

413
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Nothing, just calling you.

414
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,360
What's up?

415
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
Now I can be completely sure

416
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,480
that you are the culprit.

417
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,400
Have you ever eaten fried spider?

418
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,720
Big deep-fried spiders.

419
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
I eat that every day.

420
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
That's my daily food.

421
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,000
Want some?

422
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,920
Hawthorn slices.

423
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,840
I thought

424
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,600
you were going to give me a fried spider.

425
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,560
Don't think that just because you give me

426
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,240
a hawthorn slice,

427
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
I won't suspect you're the killer.

428
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,200
Fell asleep.

429
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,640
You're showing skin, your belly button is showing.

430
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Don't catch a cold, keep your stomach covered.

431
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,480
Slim waist.

432
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,040
I never want to go into this room again.

433
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,520
Why?

434
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,640
Look at the floor.

435
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,400
It's full of frustration.

436
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah.

437
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,600
You held on until the very end.

438
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,760
He held on until the end.

439
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah.

440
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
I was pressing down on him with all my strength.

441
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
At that moment, I really wanted to know

442
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
from the camera's angle

443
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,040
what you were doing then.

444
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
I was sitting there.

445
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,240
I was sitting in that corner, pulling two people.

446
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,720
The two of them kept moving forward.

447
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,599
I kept pulling back.

448
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,480
What did you think I was doing then?

449
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,160
Giving you a thumbs up.

450
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,640
I have a question.

451
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,839
Who was the first to shout "help him"?

452
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,480
I said it.

453
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,640
This

454
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,760
Look, he really acts like an older brother.

455
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,520
What's wrong?

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,839
See if you can...

457
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,240
What did I do?

458
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,119
Really.

459
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,520
Just my little hand by myself.

460
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
When I was up there.

461
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
There were six big guys in front.

462
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't be like that.

463
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,600
Did you help or not?

464
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,840
Just say if you helped or not.

465
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,400
Like this.

466
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
When this episode airs,

467
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,640
we'll just clip this part out.

468
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
If you didn't help,

469
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,120
we'll clip it and post it in the group.

470
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,640
Let him...

471
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,040
treat us to the most expensive meal.

472
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,360
That's right.

473
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,800
Treat us to the most expensive meal in Beijing.

474
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,160
First, send us a big red envelope.

475
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
So cool.

476
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
This feels great, sleeping here.

477
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,680
I took a nap and fell asleep.

478
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
Take a picture of this scene.

479
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,920
Then cut this out with a green screen.

480
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,680
You really are something else.

481
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,200
I just said the exact same thing.

482
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,960
I just finished telling him.

483
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,440
Really?

484
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,160
Look, he left just the right amount of space.

485
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Edit the photo so it looks like it's in his arms.

486
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,560
Yeah, edit it so it's next to him.

487
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,480
Then I'll sleep like this.

488
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,680
Move over a bit.

489
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,640
Sprinkle the rice, hurry up.

490
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
Everyone take a turn sprinkling.

491
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,560
You sprinkle some too.

492
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,600
I want to edit your photo too.

493
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Forget it.

494
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,560
Come on, sprinkle.

495
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Come on, sprinkle quickly.

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Edit the photos for everyone.

497
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,000
That pose of yours...

498
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,480
If you edit it in, it looks a bit...

499
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
No wonder you're the boss.

500
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
You can edit this one too.

501
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,840
Let's say it's like this.

502
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,040
I'll edit the photo like this.

503
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
This scene doesn't need any editing.

504
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,000
Just as it is.

505
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
You really know how to do it.

506
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,720
No.

507
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,120
Zhang Linghe, you really...

508
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,600
Forget it.

509
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,120
I won't say another word to him.

510
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,360
Let's close the door properly.

511
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,960
Close the security area's door properly.

512
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
But Ba hasn't come.

513
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,880
Ba isn't here yet.

514
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,840
Someone hasn't come in yet.

515
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,040
Alright.

516
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Let's go.

517
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Time to work.

518
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,520
Wait a second.

519
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
Wait, let me take a look from here.

520
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,040
There's a gap here.

521
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,920
Over here.

522
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
We can get in, right?

523
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,120
How do we secure this?

524
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Can it be cut?

525
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,680
Can you help me turn off the lights?

526
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,040
The lights inside.

527
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Turn off the lights inside.

528
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,720
Close that door in a bit.

529
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,920
Say that something's going on with Reba over there.

530
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,120
No need, you don't have to say anything.

531
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,480
Just close it gently.

532
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,880
Say to close the door first.

533
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,080
Tell Jin Jing to close the door.

534
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,800
Let's make sure the door is closed.

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Close the security area's door properly.

536
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Close the door.

537
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,560
Just say I'll come back later.

538
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,040
Let's record this part first.

539
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
But Ba hasn't come.

540
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't know how to close this door.

541
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,920
Because there's nothing inside...

542
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,040
Just close it, just close it gently.

543
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Ba.

544
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,960
I'll do it.

545
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll do it.

546
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,680
It's done.

547
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,280
What about Ba?

548
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,800
I don't know.

549
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
It's all railings, just go from there.

550
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,680
Wait a moment, let me get ready.

551
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,320
Give me a cue.

552
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Don't fall, be careful.

553
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,600
Turn off the lights.

554
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
Amazing.

555
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Ba still hasn't come.

556
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,880
Wait a second.

557
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,200
Wait, she's over there.

558
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
Over there, she's over there.

559
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
I'll hit you.

560
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,760
So annoying.

561
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,520
What should I do?

562
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,280
Because of this of yours...

563
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
Because of your voice...

564
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,920
It broke down.

565
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,360
We're already used to you.

566
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,240
Even if you're hoarse.

567
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,920
We're already used to you.

568
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,760
Unless you make that sound again.

569
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,200
So scary.

570
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Which sound?

571
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
That one.

572
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,320
The time you scared Xun.

573
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,520
The time you scared Xun.

574
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,800
I even took off my shoes on purpose.

575
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
This part didn't work, delete it.

576
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,800
You messed up more than once today.

577
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,640
You specifically asked them to turn off the lights, right?

578
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,520
Yes.

579
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,920
Yes, I specifically asked them to turn off the lights.

580
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
You were thinking about this at the door.

581
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,200
I was planning to scare you.

582
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

583
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
I was listening to you all the time.

584
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,240
Annoying.

585
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
Annoying.

586
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,960
How about we do it again?

587
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,760
No.

588
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,600
Let's do it again.

589
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,480
No.

590
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,320
No.

591
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Mainly because it's too far.

592
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,720
Why weren't you scared?

593
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,480
I was scared.

594
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,040
My voice can't make a sound today.

595
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,360
Are you hot?

596
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,920
Are you really cold?

597
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,320
Yes.

598
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,240
Because you just said you were cold.

599
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,800
Go handcuff someone else.

600
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,760
Save time.

601
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Let them handcuff each other.

602
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
Go ahead, man, handcuff.

603
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,240
Come on, handcuff.

604
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
What are you guys doing?

605
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Come back.

606
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Come here.

607
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
Someone handcuff me.

608
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,200
In the front or the back?

609
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,320
Handcuff behind, right?

610
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,840
Handcuff behind.

611
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,360
Okay, that's fine.

612
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Here, I'll do it myself.

613
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,560
Alright, that's fine, go ahead.

614
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,160
Handcuff behind the back.

615
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,080
Next, handcuff.

616
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,640
Got it.

617
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,360
What?

618
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,600
Cross handcuff.

619
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,320
Cross handcuff.

620
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,360
Didn't you notice?

621
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
Handcuff in pairs.

622
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,240
Three-person handcuff.

623
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,440
We do six-person handcuff, six-person handcuff.

624
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,840
Six handcuffs.

625
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
Six handcuffs.

626
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,360
It's so complicated.

627
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,040
Wait a second.

628
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,280
No, I don't get it at all.

629
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,960
You don't need to understand.

630
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,520
Let the staff handle it.

631
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,480
Like this.

632
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
They're all free now.

633
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
What's wrong with them?

634
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,880
They suddenly gave up.

635
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you sure it's

636
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,760
the handcuffs connecting two people together?

637
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,360
Shouldn't we be tied together ourselves?

638
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,000
Or is it each person's handcuff on their own hand?

639
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,040
"Hoof"

640
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,960
No, I got it.

641
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
Actually, I know how to do it.

642
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,440
Here, like this.

643
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
Just cuff arm to arm and that's it.

644
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,920
Ning, give me your hand.

645
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,120
Isn't this way fine?

646
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
Yeah.

647
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,360
Come on, just give me your hand.

648
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,360
Right, just like linking arms.

649
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,120
Yeah.

650
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,160
Just link arms.

651
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,840
Yeah, link arms.

652
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,520
Link arms.

653
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,600
As long as the two arms are crossed,

654
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,120
it's fine.

655
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,840
Whose foundation is this?

656
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,280
No idea.

657
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,840
This should be... whose clothes are these?

658
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
Liu Yuning's.

659
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Then they're mine.

660
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,200
Yours.

661
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
You're on his right.

662
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,880
What do you mean?

663
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,920
Foundation.

664
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,440
Foundation.

665
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
I removed her makeup, that's what I meant.

666
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,160
Don't pinch my skin.

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,560
Skin.

668
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,720
I have a lot of skin.

669
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
So now my left hand has it.

670
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,840
It's fine, your right hand is on my hand.

671
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,040
Then how do I connect my left hand?

672
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,560
Just connect with your right hand, that's enough.

673
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
We're a perfect closed loop.

674
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
Right, connect with your right hand.

675
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,360
Got it.

676
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,320
I still don't get it.

677
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,240
What if we can't untangle ourselves later?

678
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,520
We really might not be able to untangle.

679
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,360
We're not going to the airport like this tomorrow, are we?

680
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
You're going to the airport tomorrow.

681
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,920
You're leaving tonight.

682
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,720
We're not going to Shenzhen with you, are we?

683
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Let's go.

684
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,400
You're leaving today?

685
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah, there's a shoot tomorrow.

686
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,760
What time are you leaving?

687
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,560
I don't know, I'll leave after filming.

688
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,120
Can you wrap up with us?

689
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,960
You have to finish filming with us, right?

690
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
You'll wrap up with us, right?

691
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,600
We should finish together, right?

692
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,520
Don't let it end up that

693
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
you're not there when we eat or chat.

694
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,000
What, are you being punished to stand?

695
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,280
What's up with you?

696
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,240
What's wrong?

697
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,120
What's wrong?

698
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
There are no more chains.

699
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,840
No chains left, lend me to him.

700
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,680
I have two chains here.

701
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,520
It's fine.

702
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,040
I don't have a chain, so I won't tie up.

703
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,600
That's how it is.

704
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
That's fine, that works too.

705
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,120
I untied it.

706
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,720
That's how it is.

707
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
Then why do we have to get tangled up together?

708
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Why did we even do this just now?

709
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,760
Why do we have to be together?

710
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,280
No, it's not like that for a moment.

711
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,800
Jiuluo

712
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,840
Seems like

713
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,160
Studied abroad

714
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,840
The young lady who returned from studying abroad

715
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,600
They're promoting me, Nie Jiuluo.

716
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,520
I heard "ninth floor."

717
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,440
Are you a female assassin?

718
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,480
No, I'm a good person.

719
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,520
But I kill monsters.

720
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,040
Monsters like you.

721
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,320
It's my turn.

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
My nose itches.

723
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,440
Help him pick his nose, his nose itches.

724
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,120
Jin Jing

725
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Scratch his nose for him.

726
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,880
Zhou Keyu, give him your shoulder.

727
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,840
Let him rub his nose on your shoulder.

728
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,600
It's too itchy for him.

729
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,240
This shoulder is too broad, it's a bit scary.

730
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,520
Use your finger to help him pick it.

731
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,240
Pick quickly.

732
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,280
Where does it itch?

733
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,600
Are you about to torture me?

734
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,040
I'll really help you.

735
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,240
She

736
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,040
No, he'll just use a tissue to stuff it in for you.

737
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,920
You'll feel a bit better.

738
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,040
She man

739
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
You two

740
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,960
How did you get out?

741
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,240
Weren't you with your Brother Bai?

742
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,600
Weren't you tied together?

743
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Who's Brother Bo?

744
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Bai Yu.

745
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,040
You can cuff Brother Bai on this side.

746
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,720
His side is empty.

747
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,320
Can't cuff it.

748
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
They don't want to cuff me right now.

749
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,160
You can't slip out of this, can you?

750
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
No way, how could you slip out?

751
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,360
I'd have to crawl through you completely.

752
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,160
You're overthinking it.

753
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
It's impossible to slip out.

754
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
You're overthinking it.

755
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,720
Are you saying my arm is

756
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,480
two meters long so you can crawl out?

757
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Right.

758
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,600
So this is...

759
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,120
Is there a way to break out of it?

760
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,000
There must be a way, I think there definitely is.

761
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,120
There's no way to break out.

762
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
We just need to stick together.

763
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,640
No.

764
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Yes, stick together.

765
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,080
I mean, can you pull your hand out?

766
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,840
No, I know.

767
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,600
Let's turn clockwise.

768
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,680
Then, when our speed

769
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,240
exceeds the speed of light,

770
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,760
the metal will automatically change its properties.

771
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,720
It'll break on its own.

772
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
That's so childish.

773
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,680
Sis, can you help adjust my glasses?

774
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
Sis, help me with my glasses.

775
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,040
Can one of you come and do this move?

776
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,960
Boss.

777
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,880
How about you let us go?

778
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,120
What's going on?

779
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,320
What's happening?

780
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,120
Stay put. We're leaving.

781
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,840
Wait a second.

782
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,920
Hold on, don't leave yet.

783
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,720
Because my handcuffs are unlocked.

784
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,960
Okay.

785
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
If you unlocked them, just keep quiet.

786
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,640
Are you the mole?

787
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Just admit it yourself.

788
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,880
You're crazy.

789
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
I don't even want to say anything more.

790
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,960
I have to.

791
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
I have to eat something.

792
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,680
What do you want to eat?

793
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,480
The snack shop is open.

794
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,080
Have an egg.

795
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,360
It's fine, I really don't want any.

796
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,880
Not eating.

797
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,480
Do you want some?

798
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,040
Do you have any candy? Give me one.

799
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,600
I have some.

800
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Which kind of candy do you want?

801
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,480
Have this one.

802
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,880
Thanks.

803
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,920
Mine is this candy.

804
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,720
What? What kind of candy?

805
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,280
This one, mint candy.

806
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,920
Come on.

807
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,840
Goodbye.

808
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,600
It's over.

809
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Finished.

810
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
It ended just like that.

811
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,240
Actually, the last season ended with a bit of ceremony.

812
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,880
This season is a bit...

813
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,600
A bit...

814
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,640
And it's the finale.

815
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,320
That scared me to death.

816
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
Look behind you, quick!

817
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,720
Wow, what's that?

818
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,400
It's lit up.

819
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
The lights are on.

820
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,720
Weren't they just on?

821
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,560
No.

822
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,680
They weren't on when we arrived.

823
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,400
It wasn't like this when we got here.

824
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,720
They weren't on, the ones above weren't on.

825
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,360
You mean those lights above, the lanterns?

826
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,120
Yeah, the little fish ones weren't on either.

827
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,000
I really didn't expect this.

828
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,640
What a fruitful day, I got three phone numbers today.

829
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,920
Where did they come from?

830
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,000
One is mine.

831
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Two are from the storyline.

832
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
You like playing with guns? This one's for you.

833
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,400
I've got one here.

834
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,880
Dual guns.

835
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,440
No.

836
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,560
Give it to your brother.

837
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Face off with him.

838
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,880
Act out "Infernal Affairs" with him.

839
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I have to eat stinky tofu.

840
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,080
Where is it?

841
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
I don't know.

842
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,880
It's almost over, we've got everything, sis.

843
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,680
That point today was pretty crucial.

844
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,200
Which point?

845
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,520
The one with An Wenzhe on the left.

846
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,920
I didn't even have that information.

847
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
You're impressive.

848
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,360
Yeah.

849
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,080
What's this?

850
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,880
Sizzling tofu.

851
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,160
I'll want that later.

852
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,960
That one smells really good too.

853
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,960
It smells so good.

854
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,080
I want the sizzling tofu.

855
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,280
You'll get everything.

856
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,560
Really?

857
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,760
Yes, she'll buy it for you.

858
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,280
That's good then.

859
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,280
Why not try it?

860
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
He won't let me take it.

861
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,600
Won't let me buy it.

862
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,360
You're complaining everywhere.

863
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,280
They won't let me buy it, they won't let me eat.

864
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Still need to grab some balloons.

865
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Let's start with grabbing balloons.

866
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm too scared to grab them.

867
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
So happy.

868
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Why aren't you playing?

869
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,200
Come down and play.

870
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
No, I'm scared.

871
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:42,880
No.

872
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,400
All of us older kids are playing here.

873
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
And you're over there pretending to be mature.

874
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm really scared of this.

875
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,080
Even though all the balloons are empty,

876
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,320
they're still heart-shaped.

877
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,280
That's right, that heart shape.

878
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Hollow-hearted person.

879
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,640
You're still the killer in this episode.

880
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,760
Still looking for the killer.

881
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,560
You're still over there in a dress.

882
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,840
Her shoes are easy to step on.

883
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's start deducing.

884
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,640
You look so beautiful.

885
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,400
What?

886
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,480
Let's start deducing.

887
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
Okay. Can you do it?

888
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,640
I'll pull you along with me.

889
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,120
Okay.

890
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Three, two, one.

891
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,040
Jump.

892
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,560
Do you need to get ready?

893
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,720
Getting ready.

894
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,040
Go slower.

895
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,480
We just need to jump in place, right?

896
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,400
Come on.

897
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Three, two, one.
