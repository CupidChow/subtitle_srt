1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,440
This is the dessert you won.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,320
Yeah.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
I won it, right.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,920
This is what I won.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
It looks so delicious.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
The food in jail isn't bad.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,200
Is this filled with meat?

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
It's just a plain steamed bun.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,120
Plain.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,520
Just eating a big steamed bun.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,520
Big steamed buns are super tasty, try it.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,240
Yeah, really.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,440
If we finish this meal now,

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,280
they'll come back.

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,680
Right?

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,920
We'll all be locked together, right?

17
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah.

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,960
In that case, there's a way.

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,720
We can lock ourselves in the cell.

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,480
They won't be able to get in.

21
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,840
Would that scare people, you guys?

22
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760
Your face is so close.

23
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm totally charmed by you.

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,680
I'm definitely not voting for you today.

26
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,000
No, you have to vote for him.

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
Were you just sitting on these two buckets?

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,240
You sat on this.

29
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
Yeah.

30
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
Did you think I was just squatting the whole time?

31
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,520
I thought you brought a little stool.

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,200
It worked out.

33
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,600
What's wrong?

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,640
Haven't I told you so many times already?

35
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
And you still say "I know."

36
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,879
And in the end?

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
Don't look at me, you're scary.

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,520
Your eyes are too big.

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,960
Stop it.

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
Don't look at me, my eyes are too big.

41
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,800
Do my eyes look scary to you?

42
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,080
They're still scary now.

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Because you can't see the pupil.

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
It's just all white.

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
I miss that little dog.

46
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
ENFP.

47
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,600
Yeah.

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
Do you want to eat something?

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's get something.

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,720
Maybe we can't get anything right now.

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
The bag seems to have fallen down.

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
Then forget it.

53
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,240
Let me see where the bag is.

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Don't drop the keys.

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,040
The bag is here.

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,440
Use your foot.

57
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
Yeah, right.

58
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,720
Otherwise, you can't get it up.

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,800
Got it.

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Awesome!

61
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,600
We should've bought some food earlier.

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,840
See, it would've been great to buy that ice jelly.

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Yeah.

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
Now we can have ice jelly.

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,120
What's this?

66
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Cream puffs.

67
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
I want to eat that dried tofu.

68
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,160
No dried tofu, but there's beef tendon.

69
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,800
What are you arguing about?

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Time to eat.

71
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,520
Like this?

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
Hey, big bro—

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
You're really making a fuss over nothing.

74
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,920
Sorry.

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,440
It's fine.

76
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,960
Can you untie us so we can eat?

77
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,320
We definitely won't run away.

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
There really is ice jelly.

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,720
There are steamed buns.

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,160
The two of us are tied together.

81
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,360
We can't eat like this.

82
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,040
Can you untie us?

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
We promise we won't run.

84
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
How else are we supposed to eat?

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,760
Not untying you, seriously...

86
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you, big bro.

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,160
Turns out you're a good person.

88
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,800
Stern face, kind heart.

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280
Stern face, kind heart.

90
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,120
You still need to eat your fill.

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,560
Okay.

92
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:09,880
Okay.

93
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
When will they come to rescue us?

94
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
You think someone will come save you? Keep dreaming.

96
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,080
Here, let me untie you.

97
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Big steamed bun.

98
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,960
Little celery.

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
Then they found the two of us eating.

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,520
They came to rescue us.

101
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,880
This is hot.

102
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:38,960
Alright.

103
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,240
It's okay.

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,880
This is the dessert you won.

105
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes.

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
I won it, yes.

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,240
I told them it was dessert.

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
It's fine, you don't need to lock it.

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
We won't run away.

110
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Really, trust me this time.

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,320
Do you dare to play a trust game with me?

112
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,880
Guess.

113
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
We're already locked in here and you're still saying this.

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Let's go.

115
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,240
What's this?

116
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
Then it's iron spoon rice cake.

117
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,480
Because I was worried someone couldn't eat spicy food.

118
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
This one is fine, this one.

119
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
The food in jail isn't bad.

120
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,440
Maybe they'll come in soon.

121
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Then they can have some of ours.

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
We're here to...

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,480
...stay for what?

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
...the VIP room.

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
So delicious.

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
This one can't be opened.

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
It won't open.

128
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
This one is really tasty.

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
The mugwort cake feels like...

130
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
It smells like fried rice noodles.

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Delicious.

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,640
Let me take a look.

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,320
What?

134
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
The words on that key.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
I was careless just now.

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Don't let them find out.

137
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,360
What are you holding in your hand?

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,640
Hand it over.

139
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,000
There's nothing.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Hand it over.

141
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm not holding anything.

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
Take out what's in your hand.

143
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
There's nothing.

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Hurry up.

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,040
You guys are so fierce.

146
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,040
What are you doing?

147
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,680
Hurry and call the female police officer over.

148
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,280
Hurry up.

149
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Who?

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Someone's knocking, your boss is knocking.

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
Search.

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
Search for what?

153
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
Give me your hand first, your left hand.

154
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,760
The barred door.

155
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,560
That one can't be opened at all.

156
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,400
It's not the same one.

157
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Put it away first.

158
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,200
Bringing a bag really is useful.

159
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Yes.

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,120
Just now.

161
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,640
I looked down and saw it on my leg.

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,040
You're amazing.

163
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,120
I secretly tossed it, and you caught it.

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
They said something about a mouse hole.

165
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,440
Where is it?

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,120
It's probably this one.

167
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,880
Are there any other holes here?

168
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
This is the one, you were right.

169
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,400
Is it locked?

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
The shredded potatoes are amazing.

171
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
Yeah, they're delicious.

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
There really isn't any other way.

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,600
We could escape.

174
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,320
Come in.

175
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,240
It's time to eat.

176
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay.

177
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,720
You guys stay here.

178
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,400
Take your time and eat.

179
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,120
Alright.

180
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,680
Thank you, big bro.

181
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Thanks.

182
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Big bro, you're the coolest.

183
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
I'll leave the soup outside.

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
If you can't finish it, that's fine.

185
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Big bro.

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
Take your time eating here.

187
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Okay.

188
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Love you, big bro.

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
Thank you.

190
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
Let's go eat too.

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
Alright, you guys eat too.

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,880
Eat more, big bro.

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,520
Should we open the door now?

195
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
Open it, they've gone to eat.

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,800
It's open.

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,200
It's open.

198
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
There are three portions.

199
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Let's eat first, don't worry about it for now.

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
I just thought it was Shen Yue.

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,280
She left, right?

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
So what was her story yesterday?

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,720
At first, when we woke up,

204
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
we thought we were members of the Good family.

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
I was the eldest young master's wife.

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
He was the eldest young master.

207
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,080
Bai was the younger young master.

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,880
He liked me.

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
So both brothers liked me.

210
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
What is this?

211
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
A forbidden love.

212
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
Right.

213
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Sister-in-law, what is this called?

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
What is it called? I forgot.

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
How do you describe it?

216
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,559
Then Ning had a concubine named Yue.

217
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,480
Yue was He's stepmother, the younger wife.

218
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
"Stepmother literature."

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Right, she would secretly watch He bathe every day.

220
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,400
Then we found out

221
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
that only He and I

222
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,800
were people from a hundred years ago.

223
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,960
All the others

224
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
were hired by Ning

225
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,360
to deceive the two of us.

226
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,040
In order to create

227
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,280
the atmosphere that we were a Good family.

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,800
We were all acting.

229
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah.

230
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
And the victim was our great-grandfather.

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,160
Tu Taiye.

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
Then he would die.

233
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,760
Why did he die?

234
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Anyway, each of us

235
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
had a motive to kill him.

236
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,440
But the most exciting part yesterday was Zhou Keyu.

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,760
He insisted from start to finish that Bai Ge was the killer.

238
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,600
But Bai Ge, you know,

239
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,720
do you know how hard he defended himself yesterday?

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,200
It was the first time I saw him so serious.

241
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
He kept talking and talking.

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,960
His neck even turned red.

243
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
He said, "It absolutely couldn't be me."

244
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
"I'll walk you through it again."

245
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,240
You know,

246
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
in the end, he made us go over it all again.

247
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
Because our method of killing

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,200
was very spatial.

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
We were all already exhausted.

250
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,320
He said, "Let's do it again, one more time."

251
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,440
Then I said to Zhou Keyu,

252
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
I said, "Bai Ge is in such a good state,"

253
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,720
"it definitely can't be him."

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
Zhou Keyu said,

255
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
"Do you know him better, or do I?"

256
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
I said, "Well, let's see in the end,"

257
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
"which of us knows him better."

258
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,000
Turns out, Bai Ge wasn't the killer.

259
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
So who was it?

260
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,320
Ning.

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
Zhou Keyu voted for the wrong person.

262
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,960
Otherwise, Ning would have been unanimously voted as the killer.

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
That's how Zhou Keyu had his "Waterloo" moment.

264
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
So he was the detective yesterday.

265
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
He wasn't.

266
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,720
He's just one of the suspects.

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,400
Then who did you vote for?

268
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
I voted for Ning.

269
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,680
You seem to get it right every time.

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,360
Actually, I don't.

271
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,520
But not everyone else gets it right.

272
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,000
Come in.

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
Me.

274
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Come in.

275
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
Who are you?

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,200
Me.

277
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,400
Come in and have something to eat.

278
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,640
Have some food, this is really tasty.

279
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,560
Wait a moment.

280
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,440
They can break out, they can get out.

281
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,360
Afterwards, you can take the key.

282
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,640
Here's something for you.

283
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,760
It's fine, you guys take your time eating.

284
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Go do your task.

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
You have food too, I was just about to get it for you.

286
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,720
What is this?

287
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,040
It's delicious.

288
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
What is it?

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,120
I don't know.

290
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Have another one.

291
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,520
Do you want some? This is really good.

292
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,480
This is delicious.

293
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,800
I don't want any.

294
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
They're investigating the case.

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
You keep reminding him.

296
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,760
What's the point if there's nothing to eat?

297
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
Do we need to save them?

298
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,520
No need to save them.

299
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,440
I think so too.

300
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,960
Let's eat first.

301
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,240
We're all full.

302
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
But yesterday, Bai was really impressive.

303
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,680
He said right from the start

304
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
that Liu Yuning was the culprit.

305
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,400
Liu Yuning was completely stunned.

306
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
He didn't even know why.

307
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Every time he's the culprit, Bai always catches him.

308
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,880
So, are you the culprit this time?

309
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,080
No.

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
I don't think you are either.

311
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
We have three bowls of noodles.

312
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
You two can have some more noodles.

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah.

314
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,800
We can't eat anymore.

315
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,400
I won this.

316
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,320
I want to order this special rice noodles.

317
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,640
Shouldn't you get each of us a bowl?

318
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,720
That's three bowls.

319
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,400
Alright.

320
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,920
I'll eat a little to give you face.

321
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,800
Here.

322
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
It looks so delicious.

323
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,480
This one looks really tasty.

324
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
What kind of meat is this?

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,440
Is it beef?

326
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,520
It should be beef.

327
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
Try it yourself.

328
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Okay.

329
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,960
Alright, thank you.

330
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,680
I'm full.

331
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,600
I just told Ba about it.

332
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,760
How great we were yesterday.

333
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
He just left.

334
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,520
So heartless.

335
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,040
What about last time? After I left?

336
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,960
Jumped off the building, right?

337
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,160
That round.

338
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,680
My heart was racing when you opened your eyes.

339
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,760
Why?

340
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Because there wasn't a killer yet.

341
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Contacted me.

342
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,040
But I still felt something was a bit off.

343
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
I thought no one would open their eyes.

344
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,240
But you trusted me and opened your eyes.

345
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,640
I did.

346
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
Were you always sure

347
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
that you were really the killer?

348
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Then why didn't you choose X?

349
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
Yeah, I didn't choose X.

350
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,440
The stab wounds on his body

351
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
were caused by me.

352
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,840
Right.

353
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
And I had a plot to choose X.

354
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
But I didn't choose it.

355
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,520
You're brilliant.

356
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,920
Tell me again, how do I save you all?

357
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,320
Do you have the key?

358
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,280
Didn't you give it to me?

359
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,640
Right. Have you been to the second floor?

360
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,440
No, I haven't.

361
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,120
Go.

362
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,880
And then?

363
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
In that office

364
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
there's a key to save us.

365
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,280
Okay.

366
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,200
That's so cool.

367
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
But it's also clever that you didn't choose.

368
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,160
Because I knew you were the only one as X.

369
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
No, as the detective.

370
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,320
So you didn't choose.

371
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,400
So I didn't choose.

372
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,920
Please don't make me look so bad anymore.

373
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,480
Okay?

374
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
You're exactly like I was last time.

375
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,240
I wasn't the real culprit last time either.

376
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,800
So I didn't choose X either.

377
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,280
But I did have the part where I could choose X.

378
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,920
They asked me if I wanted to choose X.

379
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,560
I said no.

380
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Why are you so nice?

381
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,960
You were afraid I'd be singled out by everyone

382
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,000
and targeted, right?

383
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,680
Because it's just one person.

384
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
First, there are two ways to think about it.

385
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
One is,

386
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,040
it's just one person.

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,480
I've been in that position once, haven't I?

388
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,200
When the boss died.

389
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,200
And I felt like

390
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,640
you just don't know who to trust.

391
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,080
When there are five people, it gets really chaotic.

392
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,840
And that time,

393
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,080
everyone was the culprit.

394
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,520
Everyone sent me messages.

395
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,560
So it was really confusing.

396
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,680
Then I thought,

397
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,480
if I chose another X,

398
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,680
then

399
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,920
the chances of success would be high.

400
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,880
But then I felt

401
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,840
it would be really stressful.

402
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,280
You'd feel a lot of pressure if you were X.

403
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,960
And another thing is, I think

404
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
it doesn't really matter if you don't choose.

405
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Just play and see how it goes.

406
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,120
See if you can fool others.

407
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
I've been through tough times myself.

408
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,200
So I want to shield you from them.

409
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,560
But in the end, I still used you like that.

410
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,760
When this episode airs,

411
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,560
it can be edited together with what's happening now.

412
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,240
Is everyone eating?

413
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,520
I don't know.

414
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,280
I feel like only the two of us are eating.

415
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah.

416
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,680
Why are you here?

417
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,440
Do you have the key?

418
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,720
Yes.

419
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:49,880
Yes.

420
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,000
Come, follow me.

421
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,360
Hurry.

422
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,880
Hurry, save them.

423
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,960
Stop talking, come save them.

424
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
Life in the cell is really good.

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
The food is amazing.

426
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
No wonder it smells so fishy.

427
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,000
Did you two not eat?

428
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Open the door first, unlock it.

429
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,320
I'm stuffed.

430
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,200
This rice noodles.

431
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,880
Have some of these noodles.

432
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,120
Come in and eat something.

433
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
These are the noodles Bai won.

434
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,080
Thank you.

435
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,600
Eat, hurry and eat.

436
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,240
Steamed bun.

437
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,800
You two, eat up.

438
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,760
We just caught a doll.

439
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,520
It's for you.

440
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,240
We wanted to get two.

441
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,560
But we could only get one.

442
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,400
Thank you.

443
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,080
You two are friends now, have some fun.

444
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,600
Our brothers and sisters are still trapped there.

445
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,640
And we're here catching dolls.

446
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,400
It's fine.

447
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,280
It's rare to get a chance to relax.

448
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,720
Alright.

449
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,920
Got one.

450
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,480
Caught it.

451
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
Caught one.

452
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,960
So we just need to take one with us, right?

453
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,680
Which one?

454
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,120
Two little girls.

455
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
Shouldn't each person get one?

456
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
That makes sense.

457
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Right?

458
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Okay.

459
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
One more round, let's go again.

460
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,400
Okay.

461
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Let's go.

462
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
Bro, have something to eat, you go first.

463
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,040
Did you guys eat?

464
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,520
We did.

465
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,320
You ate.

466
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,240
We all ate.

467
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,440
We just had a quick bite.

468
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,360
The two of us just now—

469
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,280
Just now, to find this key,

470
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,440
to find your key,

471
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,600
we dressed up as the fat and skinny monks.

472
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
What are the fat and skinny monks?

473
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,200
It's—

474
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,240
The fat monk and the skinny monk.

475
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
Didn't you say one is 1.4 meters and the other is 1.9 meters?

476
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,400
One's a big fat guy, the other's got a big beard, right?

477
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,120
We went to a costume shop to buy

478
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,920
clothes for someone 1.4 meters tall

479
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,720
and a fake beard.

480
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,320
Then we dressed up and went to find the contact.

481
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,840
And the contact gave us

482
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,480
an access card.

483
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
Thanks for your hard work.

484
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,560
Still, we

485
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
are more comfortable sitting in jail.

486
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,040
And this, too.

487
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,800
A bowl of this soup.

488
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,319
Thank you.

489
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,560
What is this?

490
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Chicken soup.

491
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
This is tasty, that one is tasty too.

492
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,359
Chicken with cordyceps.

493
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,720
Where did this come from?

494
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Who won this?

495
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
The food from our side.

496
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,080
The guys' food, right?

497
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes.

498
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
You two eat dried fruits.

499
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,160
Yes.

500
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,040
The two of us eat noodles.

501
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,480
Not bad at all.

502
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,400
Come on, have a seat.

503
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,960
So warm.

504
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,680
Really nice.

505
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,360
Really nice.

506
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
Alright, then the two of us will just have a little.

507
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Eat a little.

508
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
You guys find a spot.

509
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,160
Over there.

510
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,760
The cell—move a bit from your cell.

511
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,560
We've been sitting for a long time.

512
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,240
Yeah.

513
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,040
We've just been sitting all this time.

514
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,840
Handcuffed together.

515
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,560
But there's a problem.

516
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,040
You've worked hard.

517
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,240
If we finish this meal now,

518
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
and they come back,

519
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,480
right?

520
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
We'll all be locked together, right?

521
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,840
Yes.

522
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,280
In that case, there's a way.

523
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,040
We can lock ourselves in the cell.

524
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,800
They won't be able to get in.

525
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,960
Inside this tube of yours is

526
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,520
for talking to them.

527
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,600
We were just chatting.

528
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,840
It's so far over there.

529
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,240
Really far.

530
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,560
Is that so?

531
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,280
We're on the second floor.

532
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,960
We've been chatting for ages.

533
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
It's so tiring.

534
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Hurry, eat a bit more.

535
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh no, you look like an assassin.

536
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
I look like an assassin?

537
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,880
Being nice for no reason.

538
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,520
After eating, go up to the second floor.

539
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
After the inspection, return to your place.

540
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,680
It's okay, take your time eating.

541
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
Don't rush, don't choke.

542
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,760
It's fine, eat up.

543
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,360
It's okay, you can do it.

544
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,560
You can do it.

545
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,240
So we came here to look for that clue.

546
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
This one.

547
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,520
Yes.

548
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
And there's a key, right?

549
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,040
Yes.

550
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,840
We have another key.

551
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,400
There's a card in the second-floor office.

552
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,640
We can go to the second floor.

553
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
Then how do we get to the second floor?

554
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
No, there's a code lock over there.

555
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,280
Why is it open now?

556
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
The two of them came down from there.

557
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,760
Really?

558
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,160
Yes, they came down from that door.

559
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,560
No.

560
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,560
The door where we met.

561
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,240
You came out from there?

562
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,360
No, we didn't go in.

563
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,160
You can't get in from that side.

564
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,280
I know which one you mean.

565
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
You came out from that door?

566
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,880
No, we came in through the main entrance.

567
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,960
We came in through the cell's wooden bars.

568
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,520
I know.

569
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,360
The wooden bars—did you go up to the second floor?

570
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,040
No.

571
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
Then you came out from that door?

572
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
That's the one we could get into.

573
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
There's an access card here, that one lets you in.

574
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,680
We couldn't go any further inside.

575
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,560
Then we came out.

576
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,280
And we happened to run into you.

577
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes, them.

578
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,360
What's wrong?

579
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,400
Haven't I told you so many times already?

580
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
You keep saying "I know."

581
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,640
And in the end?

582
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,280
Hello, murderer.

583
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,440
Now you're going all out against me, huh?

584
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,360
I'm a bit more clear-headed now.

585
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,800
I feel like I'm about to fully wake up.

586
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,960
Give us three more minutes.

587
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,200
It's okay, take your time eating.

588
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,920
It's not hot, it's fine.

589
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,600
No rush.

590
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Eat it for half an hour.

591
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Drink more of this.

592
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,960
Get some nutrition.

593
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,400
It's from Bai De's game.

594
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,240
This is the spoon he just used.

595
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,560
There are three bowls.

596
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,680
Each bowl has a new spoon on top.

597
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,720
This is delicious.

598
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
Why didn't you tell me there was this?

599
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,480
Steamed bun.

600
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,560
Is this filled with meat?

601
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
It's just a plain steamed bun.

602
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,480
White.

603
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,800
Pure white.

604
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah.

605
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
Just eat a big steamed bun plain.

606
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,360
The big steamed bun is super tasty, try it.

607
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,080
Yeah, really.

608
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,800
Try it.

609
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,480
You should have some steamed bun too.

610
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,280
I'll finish this first.

611
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,040
Get some carbs.

612
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
Drink up all this chicken soup.

613
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,840
You startled me.

614
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,240
Who is it?

615
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
You guys are really scary.

616
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you know how to scare people?

617
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,920
Your faces are so close.

618
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,160
Yes.

619
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm totally captivated by you.

620
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,560
I'm definitely not voting for you today.

621
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
No, you have to vote for him.

622
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,040
Were you just sitting on these two buckets?

623
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
You sit on this.

624
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,080
Right.

625
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,000
Did you think I was squatting the whole time?

626
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,560
I thought you brought a small stool.

627
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,960
Turns out you were sitting on this.

628
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,320
It fits perfectly.

629
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,560
Let him sit.

630
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,280
Let Brother Bai sit down.

631
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
What is that thing?

632
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,120
What is that?

633
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
This is for locking someone up.

634
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,200
It locks your arms.

635
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,920
Come on, everyone.

636
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Let's go.

637
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,680
Go.

638
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,360
Go to the second floor.

639
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,000
One.

640
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
Let's go check out the second floor.

641
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's go.

642
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,840
What does this mean?

643
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,120
Are we still playing games?

644
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's eat.

645
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,760
It's like the last supper.

646
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,040
Hurry up and get me something to eat.

647
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,440
Chicken.

648
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,040
The ginger flavor is a bit strong.

649
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,120
I want to eat ginger.

650
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,040
There's ginger here.

651
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,000
If you want to eat ginger,

652
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,720
Yes.

653
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,480
Then you should eat that big plate of chicken.

654
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,040
Or maybe ginger cola.

655
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,320
Would you just eat ginger by itself?

656
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,760
You really like it, huh?

657
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
Dried shrimp with lotus root.

658
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,560
That's mine.

659
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,200
You said it was good yesterday.

660
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
This is super tasty.

661
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,720
There's one here that hasn't been opened.

662
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,880
Do you want some noodles?

663
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,640
I'll mix it up.

664
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,280
What do you want to eat?

665
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
I can skip eating.

666
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,160
Can I scrape off some cucumber?

667
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,600
Scrape.

668
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
Just pour some directly into that bowl.

669
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,120
Just pour it over, that's fine.

670
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,720
What's this?

671
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Beef.

672
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,320
Tasty.

673
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh no, my voice is even hoarser now.

674
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
It wasn't hoarse at all during the debate just now.

675
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,200
I was just about to ask how you suddenly got better.

676
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,680
The two of them.
