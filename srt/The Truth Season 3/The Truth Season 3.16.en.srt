1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,440
Then let's all scratch our heads, okay?

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,320
Everyone, scratch your heads.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,280
All scratch your heads.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Telling you, you're all scared now.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
And you're still confused.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,120
Three, two, one.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,520
Tie theirs a bit tighter.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,960
Tie mine a bit looser.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,760
Tie his a bit tighter for me.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,000
Da Ning, hurry and come save us!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ke Wu Ku.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Stand up.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Do we have to stand up?

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,840
Do we really have to stand up?

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,040
Standing up now.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,680
Standing up.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,880
You can stand up.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Your body fat is pretty low.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,880
Because when I pinch it, it's just a thin layer.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
I was actually pretty scared at first.

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Suddenly it hurt a lot, so I jumped out.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,960
So you, Capricorn,

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,000
why are you a bit different from the two of us?

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,800
You two, in the dark,

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
do you also like pinching people like this?

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,600
Yes.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,480
Actually, you can do it like this.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,920
Take a photo with your arms crossed.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,640
Right.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
Let's pile together a bit.

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,320
Together, we're a ball of fire.

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,840
Apart,

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,760
we're a bunch of matches.

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,080
Legs are 8.5 meters long.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Let me tell you, this time I...

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Still going with deduction.

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,800
Pick a color.

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,360
It's a prop for later.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,920
Red.

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,280
Alright.

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,920
What kind of prop is this?

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,160
You can draw from it.

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,040
You can pick a person.

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,360
She needs to point.

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,480
She'll ask some questions later.

46
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,200
She'll point at someone.

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
For example, who is the most handsome here?

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
Like this, just point like this.

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
Why are you dressed so sharply?

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,080
You look way too good.

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,400
Aren't I supposed to be a finance guy?

52
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,680
Aren't you a laborer?

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
Aren't you in debt to loan sharks?

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
And you still dress like this?

55
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,800
We can't pass you off as a finance guy.

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's just say you're an insurance salesman.

57
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Definitely the culprit.

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
Don't target me.

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
Your head is all red.

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Why?

61
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,840
Look at what we're wearing.

62
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,400
We're all wearing "mink" coats.

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,960
Yeah.

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,880
Aren't we supposed to dress like factory workers?

65
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Right.

66
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm a gaming expert.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,920
A gaming expert works.

68
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Isn't that just a homebody?

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
We're just working at the factory.

70
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
So what's your actual job theme?

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm just an ordinary person.

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
We're ordinary people too.

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm an electrician.

74
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
You dress like this as an electrician?

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,360
What electrician?

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
A worker who pads his shoulders, right?

77
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,920
Shoulder-padded worker.

78
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
We don't fit in.

79
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,160
Bro, look at the two of us.

80
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,800
You're a security guard.

81
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
What do you mean, I'm a security guard?

82
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,120
This one's good.

83
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm a gaming expert.

84
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
What do you have?

85
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
I have another identity.

86
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,480
Really?

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
So he's a laborer, but he has financial attributes.

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,240
Financial attributes mean dressing like Wall Street.

89
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,600
Wall Street.

90
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
Wall Street should wear my color.

91
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,720
"The Wolf of Wall Street."

92
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,720
Factory Belle, come here quickly.

93
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,800
Look.

94
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
See, we're all dressed very plainly.

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
But look at him, why is he dressed so fancy?

96
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
We're just ordinary people.

97
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm a finance guy.

98
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,960
You look like you're attending a big awards show.

99
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Yeah.

100
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,640
Aren't you going to be cold? Are you going to wear that later?

101
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,360
The four-piece set.

102
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,880
This one looks nice.

103
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,200
Right?

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,720
Yours looks nice.

105
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,520
Thank you.

106
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Why is this one so short?

107
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Why is mine so short?

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,880
Stretch it.

109
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,240
Pull it apart.

110
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,880
Sorry.

111
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,040
How do you act scared?

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
How do you act scared?

113
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
How do you act scared?

114
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,960
You'd better just make this expression.

115
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,000
You all look scared.

116
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,240
What am I even saying?

117
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't get it.

118
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
Then let's all scratch our heads, okay?

119
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,480
Everyone scratch your heads.

120
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
All scratch your heads.

121
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Okay.

122
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Scratch your head.

123
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
We're so awkward.

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
In a moment, the photographer...

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
The photographer is the most confused.

126
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
Told you to look scared.

127
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,680
But you still look confused.

128
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
Not scratching your heads? Go ahead.

129
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,600
Should we scratch?

130
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,920
Scratch.

131
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,320
Scratch.

132
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,120
Let's take a photo while scratching.

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,680
Scratch.

134
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Three, two, one.

135
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,200
You can look a bit more scared.

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
Then look a bit more confused.

137
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,240
We can exaggerate our expressions a bit.

138
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Okay.

139
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,760
Come on.

140
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
My mouth is watering.

141
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes, that's fine, no problem.

142
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,720
Then Dilraba and Teacher Jin Jing,

143
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
you two, change your gesture.

144
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Then Teacher Liu Yuning,

145
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

146
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,320
Then change your expression again.

147
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
This one is good, try another.

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
We've had confusion and fear, what else?

149
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,560
Thinking.

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
Discovering a secret.

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
For example, let's say we're all villains.

152
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,720
And then we see this.

153
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Okay, got it.

154
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
We're the ones watching the livestream.

155
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Alright.

156
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,920
It's that kind of disdainful look.

157
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,880
With a bit of contempt.

158
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
Contempt.

159
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
Perfect

160
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm really curious

161
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
how you found a stool here.

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
Look ahead.

163
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,480
Where are your eyes?

164
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,360
Sorry.

165
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,640
You’re prejudiced against me.

166
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,440
There was a whole row of people, but you asked me.

167
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Sorry.

168
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Okay.

169
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,160
I admit I’m the “Bai Ke.”

170
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Bai Yu’s nemesis.

171
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
How do you speak Changsha Mandarin?

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
I clearly learned it.

173
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,440
Now I’ve forgotten again.

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,080
Don’t be like this.

175
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Weren’t we supposed to be tied up?

176
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,640
Why aren’t we being tied up?

177
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,840
Someone will come to tie us up.

178
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,280
Alright.

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,120
There’s no one.

180
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
No one is coming to tie us up.

181
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
It’s an invisible rope.

182
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,360
It’s the rope in people’s hearts that binds us.

183
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
I want to break free.

184
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,640
Sister

185
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
Come quickly, sister

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,840
Right, we were off-center

187
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,200
We need to be in the center of the stage

188
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,200
Don't get too close.

189
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm about to bump into Mr. Bai Yu.

190
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Can we get our hands out then?

191
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
We can't.

192
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
Then how do we get out of this?

193
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,760
We can't.

194
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,760
I can only move the chair over like this.

195
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,680
You use your mouth to help untie me bit by bit.

196
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,280
I'll turn around like this.

197
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,160
Do you get what I mean?

198
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Got it.

199
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,920
I have to say, you're pretty smart.

200
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Otherwise, that day—

201
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,040
Didn't you take photos with your feet?

202
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Your feet are pretty flexible too.

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,240
Your feet could help us get out too.

204
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,680
Then she needs her hands to take off her shoes, right?

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
And to take off her socks.

206
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,080
She can use her other foot to take off the sock.

207
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,160
You just...

208
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720
That's how I take them off.

209
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
Got it.

210
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Then can you use your own foot

211
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
to untie the rope?

212
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
You can.

213
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,080
I have another way.

214
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,040
We could just

215
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,080
stay on this chair the whole time.

216
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,560
We can still move anyway.

217
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,280
It doesn't make much difference to you.

218
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
But for us, it's pretty limiting.

219
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,240
Because it's a bit different from our daily life.

220
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Alright.

221
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry I didn't see it from your perspective.

222
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Or consider it that way.

223
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,520
Is it tied pretty tight?

224
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,400
It's fine, just normal is okay.

225
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,560
It's not uncomfortable.

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
You're not uncomfortable, right?

227
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,040
No, it's not uncomfortable.

228
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
No, not at all.

229
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
Go ahead.

230
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
It's a bit creepy.

231
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,760
This is kind of interesting.

232
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,200
No one can help anyone now.

233
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Come on.

234
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Okay, get ready, start rolling.

235
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
Five, four—

236
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,920
Wait a second.

237
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,160
Who's counting down five, four, three, two, one?

238
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
They're filming over there.

239
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,480
I mean, we haven't finished tying it yet.

240
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,080
Let's shoot the close-up first.

241
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,840
Okay.

242
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Watch how Teacher Bai acts.

243
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,440
I'll learn from it.

244
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
How should I act?

245
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,280
Then you really need to study carefully.

246
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,800
Let me learn some of this "Best Actor" acting.

247
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
It's pretty much like how we perform skits.

248
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
Alright, as soon as you start, I'll call him.

249
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll call him, and you wake up.

250
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,880
You also have to be an extra in the background.

251
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,080
You also need to play along with the scene.

252
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
Can I have that kind of

253
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
feeling like I just had a wonderful dream

254
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
and woke up smiling?

255
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,760
That works too.

256
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm speechless.

257
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,679
Your acting is really good.

258
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,840
I'm really learning.

259
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,039
My nose is so itchy right now.

260
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,760
It's okay.

261
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,400
Can you do it?

262
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,159
I can.

263
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,680
You can do it.

264
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,800
My nose is really itchy.

265
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
Jin Jing is really watching how Bai Yu acts.

266
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,040
This part.

267
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,440
Legendary.

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Go give the award.

269
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
The award must be given.

270
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,880
Seriously, I really want to laugh.

271
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,120
Here, when it's your turn to be filmed, I'll give it to you too.

272
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,920
I won't laugh.

273
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,240
Can you make a copy of that last part for me?

274
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,920
It was amazing.

275
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
This struggle.

276
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,120
I want to act out waking up with the back of my head.

277
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Is this okay?

278
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Does this work?

279
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Can you give me some guidance?

280
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
No, I want that kind of feeling.

281
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
The feeling of a skit.

282
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
How did you make that sound?

283
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Sister

284
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,680
Sister

285
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,880
What are you doing?

286
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Sister

287
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,880
Help me, sister

288
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Sister, help me

289
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Struggling

290
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,960
Holding onto each other

291
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
Encouraging each other

292
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
Come on, hang in there

293
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
We can do it

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
We have to get out

295
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
No dialogue there

296
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
No dialogue in this part

297
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Clapping

298
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,200
Acting together

299
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,680
Sister

300
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,000
Sister

301
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,920
What happened?

302
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,320
How could this happen?

303
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
Who?

304
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,800
That was amazing, I was almost moved to tears.

305
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,840
For a moment, it made me

306
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,520
feel like I was really there.

307
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Actually, I'm really looking forward to

308
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,680
acting together with you.

309
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,760
Okay.

310
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,200
So that means in a bit

311
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
we'll need to help each other.

312
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Let's untie this rope first.

313
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:39,960
Right.

314
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,560
Big Ning

315
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,560
Ning

316
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,320
Ning Lightbulb

317
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
Lightbulb

318
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
The stool seems to be able to rotate.

319
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,080
But no one is rotating the chair.

320
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,640
It seems like it can rotate.

321
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
Big Ning, hurry and come save us!

322
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,400
Ke Wu Ku

323
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,440
You all

324
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,400
You all

325
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Stand

326
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,960
Stand up

327
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,160
Do we have to stand up?

328
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,760
We can stand up.

329
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Do we really have to stand up?

330
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,480
We stood up.

331
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,120
We stood up.

332
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,760
We stood up.

333
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,520
We can stand up.

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,960
Oh no, we can't sit down anymore.

335
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,800
Alright, sit down.

336
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,120
Tie them all up a bit tighter.

337
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,560
Tie mine a bit looser.

338
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,080
Tie his a bit tighter for me.

339
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
I'll tie yours a bit looser.

340
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Just make his tighter.

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,760
Otherwise, he won't behave.

342
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm getting up to save you.

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
Okay.

344
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,520
Why is the rope on Jin Tangshao always loose?

345
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I just tied it.

346
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Be stricter with him.

347
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,840
Otherwise, he really won't behave.

348
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,840
If you show off again later, I'm telling you...

349
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,640
The five of us will walk normally.

350
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
You have to walk with the chair on your back.

351
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,400
No one will untie your rope.

352
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Don't get too cocky, I'm warning you.

353
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Bro, don't untie me no matter what.

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,400
He's the happiest.

355
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,120
Seriously, don't untie me.

356
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,520
Untie me.

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
The "grudge" from our last round

358
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
has to carry over to this round, Lao Bai.

359
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,040
The "grudge" from the last round

360
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Zhang Linghe, you look so handsome in the light.

361
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah, just like that.

362
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,400
What should I do?

363
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,240
How will you live your life from now on?

364
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,320
Meeting you feels like encountering a disaster.

365
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,720
You can't escape this disaster.

366
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,720
Hurry!

367
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,920
I can't see anything here.

368
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,280
Do we have any lyrics?

369
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,800
We don't.

370
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
The dolphin is here.

371
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,040
Is anyone there?

372
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,400
Is anyone there?

373
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,440
Is anyone there?

374
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,000
Wake up.

375
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,880
Wake up.

376
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
What's going on?

377
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Aren't we in the dorm?

378
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,200
Wait, how did this happen?

379
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,520
Why are we tied together?

380
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,360
Wait, how are we tied up again?

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Weren't we just sleeping?

382
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know.

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Hurry, think of a way to get loose.

384
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you okay?

385
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
Is anyone not tied up?

386
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,960
Can you move?

387
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,640
Yes, of course.

388
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
How is someone standing up?

389
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,120
Wait, you don't have to do that.

390
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
Drag yourself over.

391
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
Isn't this way fine?

392
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
There's a pair of scissors.

393
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,600
Really?

394
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
This...

395
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,400
This...

396
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,080
Don't go over, I'll do it.

397
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay.

398
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Your legs are so long.

399
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,800
There's someone here.

400
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,320
Someone's here.

401
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,520
I don't dare look.

402
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,040
No one.

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,440
No one.

404
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
Don't stand next to me.

405
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm scared when you're next to me.

406
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,040
She might grab you really hard in a moment.

407
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,720
You stand next to her.

408
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,160
You grabbed a bit too hard just now.

409
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,240
Why do I feel like someone pinched me?

410
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,520
I just pinched Ke really hard.

411
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
I jumped up.

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
This is scarier than a ghost appearing.

413
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
She isn't afraid of anything.

414
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,280
Walking next to those two is the scariest.

415
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,600
No, it's mainly because she's so loud.

416
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Your body fat is pretty low.

417
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,280
Because when I pinched you, it was just a thin layer.

418
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,800
Where did you pinch?

419
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,520
I wanted to grab his clothes.

420
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
But I ended up grabbing his skin too.

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
I was actually pretty scared at first.

422
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Suddenly it hurt a lot, so I jumped.

423
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,920
I said,

424
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,000
Can you take off that band-aid?

425
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
It's part of the design.

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,160
Alright.

427
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,720
Limited edition livestream room.

428
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
We can finally go now, right?

429
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,960
Yeah.

430
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
But why?

431
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,960
It's unlocked.

432
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,680
We did it unconsciously.

433
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,840
Your birthdays.

434
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
We entered them.

435
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
And solved the whole puzzle.

436
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,080
So Miyao really likes the four of us.

437
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Seriously?

438
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,200
Isn't that a bit much?

439
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
It's true.

440
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
He's your top supporter.

441
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
That's An Wenzhe we're talking about.

442
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,560
No, he's not.

443
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,120
He's actually really poor, you know.

444
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
He doesn't have any money.

445
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
That's Fu Youcai.

446
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,080
Fu Youcai only got one character right.

447
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
Youcai.

448
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,160
Youcai.

449
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,880
Isn't Fu Youcai actually Bai Youcai?

450
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,120
Bai Youcai.

451
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes, Bai Youcai.

452
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,080
When is your birthday?

453
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,720
June 3rd.

454
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,080
We're all earth signs.

455
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,720
Right.

456
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
You're an earth sign.

457
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
You're an earth sign.

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm an earth sign.

459
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,520
Is April 8th Aries? No.

460
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,080
Right.

461
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,600
Could this be related?

462
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You're a fake sign.

463
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,880
What zodiac sign is December 23rd?

464
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,480
Capricorn.

465
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,800
Three Capricorns

466
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,480
But you, as a Capricorn,

467
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,520
why are you a bit different from the two of us?

468
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,480
The three of us are really similar, don't you think?

469
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,040
Actually, we are very similar.

470
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,840
Do you two, in the dark,

471
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
also like to pinch people like this?

472
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,640
Yes, we do.

473
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,000
So exciting! Is this for real?

474
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
Let me roll up my long johns.

475
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,480
It’s going to be deep, right?

476
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,040
Yeah.

477
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Just roll up your long johns, that works.

478
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,440
Roll up your long johns.

479
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,920
Don’t get your long johns wet.

480
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,280
Roll up your long johns.

481
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,520
Let’s go.

482
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,920
If your long johns get wet, there’s nothing you can do.

483
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,680
Does anyone want some candy?

484
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
Can I finish my candy before we go?

485
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,640
I’ll have one.

486
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you want one?

487
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,320
Alright.

488
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
You guys don’t have any issues, right?

489
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,920
Actually, I’m on my period.

490
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,320
Don’t get in, I told you not to.

491
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah, or in the end, we could just...

492
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,680
Just carry you across, that’s fine.

493
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah.

494
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
Don’t.

495
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Is this water cold?

496
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
No, it’s warm.

497
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
I can feel it.

498
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,840
Don't come down yet.

499
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,480
Stay up there and check if we've put it together correctly.

500
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,600
Okay.

501
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Alright.

502
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm not lying.

503
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,000
I can...

504
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
You don't want it anymore, right?

505
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,920
Let me prove it myself.

506
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
So no one says that I...

507
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
...am not dedicated when playing games.

508
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
I'll post on Weibo to clear things up for you.

509
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,520
I'll testify.

510
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,120
It's so hot.

511
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,480
He was worried we'd get wet (and cold).

512
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,200
It's still pretty hot.

513
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,359
Is the left stroke over there?

514
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,880
It's tied up.

515
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
You saved a robot.

516
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,240
Yeah.

517
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
It looked like it was having a hard time.

518
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,880
Has Zhou Keyu gone home?

519
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,800
He said in the group yesterday that he would leave today.

520
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Has Zhou Keyu finished work?

521
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,080
He has.

522
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,560
What?

523
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,440
You’re staring at me, mesmerized.

524
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,800
You’re totally captivated by me.

525
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,360
Are you the culprit?

526
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,320
Do I look like one?

527
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
I’m so innocent.

528
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,200
Why do you have a small backpack?

529
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
It looks really nice.

530
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
Do you have anything to put in it?

531
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, lots of snacks.

532
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
I’m worried about your bag.

533
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
It might fall off.

534
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
You’re afraid I’ll eat your snacks, right?

535
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
Do you know how much Dilraba has...

536
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,480
How should I put it...

537
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,560
In Shanghainese, it’s also called “gujia” (taking care of the family).

538
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
It means things at home.

539
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,280
You’re like that rolling shutter that fell down yesterday.

540
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,240
Dilraba, hurry and go get the stuff.

541
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,280
Hurry, grab the stuff.

542
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,720
Grab the stuff, hurry up and grab it.

543
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
Want some? It's sugar-free.

544
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm on a diet.

545
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,080
No.

546
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
Are we still missing someone?

547
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
Did you forget who pulled you up yesterday?

548
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,280
Yeah.

549
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
That was so touching.

550
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
Yesterday, I really wanted to cry during that part.

551
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,560
Honestly, that part was meant to make us cry.

552
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
Otherwise, why would they get all six of us actors?

553
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,160
What for, then?

554
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,040
Can we re-record it?

555
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,040
The emotions just come up.

556
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,320
Six different acting styles.

557
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
Once we're up there, the emotions just flow.

558
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
So do we need to continue the scene today?

559
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,520
Later, we'll go out crying.

560
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,800
Yeah, with the tears.

561
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,520
Not necessarily tears, maybe just really down.

562
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,400
Like that.

563
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
I want to shed tears.

564
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,000
I want it to be as soon as the door opens.

565
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,520
Like Zhen Huan.

566
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,040
Like Zhen Huan, I say—

567
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,680
Ke Yu.

568
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,960
And then, tears.

569
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,680
Just one look and the tears fall. Okay.

570
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,640
Anyway, I feel today

571
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
just like I thought yesterday.

572
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,000
Which one?

573
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,560
He'll do it one by one.

574
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
Then save the dramatic moment for my part.

575
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,880
Okay?

576
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,520
If I get caught up in it,

577
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,680
you have to be there.

578
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,720
Sis

579
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Then the tears have to fall the moment the door closes

580
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,440
All at once

581
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
That's so challenging

582
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,240
Ke Yu should film one called "Save Me"

583
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
And we'll be down below

584
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
And then, at this spot

585
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
At the moment the door closes

586
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,280
See, one of his eyes—no, no, no

587
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,600
Look at who?

588
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
Yesterday you said today

589
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,280
When we go out later, let's continue the scene

590
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,760
Yesterday, Ke Yu "sacrificed" himself

591
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,280
We need to continue the scene, the crying scene

592
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,040
There have to be tears

593
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,880
We need to do the crying scene

594
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,520
Right

595
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,280
Then after the next round, add some dirt to the face

596
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,400
Battle damage

597
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,320
Battle damage makeup

598
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Where is this going to teleport us?

599
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,760
Right.

600
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,720
Shouldn't we say this line when opening the door?

601
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,360
Like this.

602
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's do it again.

603
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,320
Let the voice come out first, then cut to your face.

604
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,280
Pull back your face first.

605
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm going to (shout) Keyu.

606
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,680
Three, two, one.

607
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,120
It's time to use our feet again.

608
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Probably not.

609
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
It's open.

610
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,760
Hello, everyone.

611
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600
Keyu.

612
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,080
Keyu.

613
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,560
Keyu.

614
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,360
No, it's "I see it."

615
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,160
Let's do it again.

616
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,680
"I see it."

617
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,240
"I see it."

618
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
Where are you?

619
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,880
After we finished work yesterday and went home,

620
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,080
did you chat with everyone in the group?

621
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,160
Actually, as soon as we finished,

622
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,440
Bai Yu immediately sent a message in the group.

623
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,120
Okay, okay, okay.

624
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Everyone was confused and said,

625
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,080
What are you talking about?

626
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
I was startled for a moment.

627
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
He said he faked his "death."

628
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,000
Actually, he is the "big boss."

629
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,240
When I saw that, I thought, that can't be right.

630
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,760
I thought, Bai Yu usually isn't

631
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,240
the type to believe in rumors.

632
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,560
So when I saw it,

633
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,480
I thought, what's

634
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
going on? What's happening?

635
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Could the news have spread this fast?

636
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,480
I thought, that's it, what are we going to record tomorrow?

637
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
I felt really upset and...

638
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,880
Then fortunately Zhang Linghe stepped up and spoke.

639
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
Luckily he came forward.

640
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,520
He helped ease the atmosphere for me.

641
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,840
With that,

642
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,880
then Bai Yu said, "Look at you."

643
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,480
I didn't know about this either.

644
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,640
Then Zhang Linghe said,

645
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,360
So far, they

646
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,720
still pretty much believe this

647
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
this story

648
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,560
When they specifically come

649
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,640
they wear their own clothes to work today

650
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,440
because I told them yesterday

651
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,120
that I only needed to come today to shoot promotional materials

652
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,280
So handsome.

653
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,560
I think this is, in the three seasons so far,

654
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,280
The most interesting setup so far

655
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,440
The last time I felt like this

656
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,760
with such a strong sense of shock

657
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,920
was at the end of our first season

658
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,800
Let's look forward to what happens

659
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,160
Because I don't know what will happen either

660
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,920
I feel that this time

661
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,480
the production team's ideas are really creative

662
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,200
I actually hope there can be

663
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,880
a very continuous and complete worldview

664
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
I still think

665
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
bit by bit

666
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
from the first episode to the last

667
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,960
we might piece together a complete puzzle

668
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,200
I would really like that feeling

669
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,720
The format has changed quite a lot

670
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,040
It's a bit like

671
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
a combination of the first and second seasons

672
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,840
Next, let's see

673
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
who can become

674
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,960
the top player who decides their fate

675
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
And also decide

676
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,800
the top boss

677
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
killed me

678
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
He won't let you die that easily

679
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,200
He won't let you die so quickly

680
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
He'll lock you up with a snake

681
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,720
Snakes are cute

682
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,160
Are you afraid of snakes?

683
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,080
You're not afraid of snakes

684
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,960
It attacked yesterday.

685
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Then what's locked inside?

686
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
Yesterday, that person died so quickly.

687
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
But when it comes to us...

688
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,840
So that was manual.

689
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
The elevator is operated manually.

690
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,880
Yes.

691
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,760
Someone has to push it.

692
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,400
That's hilarious, we thought it was a vehicle.

693
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,600
They don't care about us anymore.

694
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,720
We're really stuck here.

695
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
Will the three players please each enter a separate door.

696
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
Each person goes into one.

697
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,760
They're going to play separately now.

698
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,720
The person holding the flashlight.

699
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
I knew it was you.

700
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm here to save you.

701
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,520
What does this mean?

702
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,640
To prevent outsiders from using the private elevator,

703
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
before staff use it,

704
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,920
they must turn on the power switch in the correct password order.

705
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,160
Only then can the elevator be used.

706
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,640
Password order.

707
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
What is the password order?

708
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,520
Password

709
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,080
is in capital letters

710
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,680
Letters and numbers

711
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,400
Can this be pressed?

712
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,120
No, it can't

713
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,600
M

714
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,200
No

715
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,720
No M

716
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,480
password

717
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,600
password

718
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,640
P A

719
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,200
Connect them

720
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,920
password

721
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,480
Connect the lines like this

722
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,680
The number in the middle is the password

723
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
So the first one is eight

724
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
pass

725
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,720
one

726
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,520
nine

727
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,280
three

728
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,920
seven

729
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,480
two

730
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,680
four

731
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I can go save them now

732
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
This is where I was just now

733
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Trap them to death

734
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,560
Bayan accordion music

735
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,040
What is this?

736
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
What theme song is this sound from?

737
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,640
They won't let us see.

738
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,680
No, it's because the lights are off.

739
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
It's fine, with this we can save everyone.

740
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,840
No need to save.

741
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,080
Okay.

742
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,560
Now they are

743
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,800
Probably playing "Draw a Circle as Prison."

744
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,760
Welcome to "Draw a Circle as Prison."

745
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,440
Next, I'll announce the game rules.

746
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,840
Players must use "I" as the subject.

747
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,360
Add a verb to the given noun in the prompt.

748
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
Take turns.

749
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,560
No repeats.

750
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,800
I like the boss.

751
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,000
I have been the boss.

752
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
I have hit the boss.

753
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
I have loved the boss.

754
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
I have beaten up the boss.

755
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
I like the boss.

756
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,680
Already said.

757
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
Already said.

758
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,680
Alright, I'm fine, it's okay.

759
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,040
You did it on purpose.

760
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,760
It's okay.

761
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
What do you mean?

762
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,480
It's going to crush me.

763
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,680
You've gotten narrower.

764
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,760
But if I get it wrong again,

765
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
you'll come back a little.

766
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,280
Yes.

767
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Yeah.

768
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,760
Then we could play forever.

769
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,920
Right.

770
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't gossip.

771
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Really?

772
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,600
I spread rumors and gossip.

773
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,840
I am gossip.

774
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,760
I hate gossip.

775
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,600
I love gossip.

776
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,120
I don't love gossip.

777
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
I stop gossip.

778
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,560
I am gossip.

779
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
I already said that.

780
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,000
I am gossip.

781
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,000
Help me.

782
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,560
Help me.

783
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,600
Can't breathe?

784
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I am the killer.

785
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
I have helped the killer.

786
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,760
I am not the killer.

787
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,680
I have been the killer.

788
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
I have killed the killer.

789
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,840
I love the killer.

790
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,600
I don't love the killer.

791
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,400
I want to be the killer.

792
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,280
I

793
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,280
I

794
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,200
So small now.

795
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,800
I am a fan.

796
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,600
I have been a fan.

797
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,120
I eat vermicelli.

798
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,760
I love eating vermicelli.

799
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,640
I don't love eating vermicelli.

800
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,840
I like eating vermicelli.

801
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,680
I

802
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,560
Speak

803
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,280
Say

804
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,560
It's stuck

805
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,480
So small

806
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,280
It's one and a half pieces now

807
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,520
I have no brains

808
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,360
I have plenty of brains

809
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,520
I like to eat brains

810
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,520
I cook brains

811
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,960
I'm pig brains

812
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,280
I stir-fry pig brains.

813
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
I kiss the brain.

814
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,040
I have no brain.

815
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,320
Didn't we already say "no brain"?

816
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,480
Who said it already?

817
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,880
He grabbed it.

818
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,320
If he grabs it again, it won't work.

819
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Heniba

820
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,960
You’re the third wheel.

821
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,560
It’s just the two of us now.

822
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,160
It’s one-on-one now.

823
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
Called Baba

824
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,920
Male artists called Baba or above

825
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,120
Liu Yuning

826
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
Zhang Linghe

827
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,360
Zhou Keyu

828
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,280
Male actors who are 188 cm tall

829
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,880
I thought it was male actors called Baba

830
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,360
Lin Yi

831
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,200
Tang Xiaotian

832
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,680
Sun Chenjun

833
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,080
Hu Yitian

834
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,680
Everyone is so impressive

835
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,640
In this game, I can only name these three

836
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
Zhang Guowei

837
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
This

838
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,200
This

839
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,200
Question

840
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,600
Who has feelings for you

841
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,680
Who feels heartache for you

842
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,160
Do you love me? You don't say anything

843
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
My love is waiting for an answer

844
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,480
What else is there

845
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,960
What else is there

846
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
The stars in the sky don't speak

847
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,480
Is this a question

848
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,440
No, I didn't ask, sorry

849
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
A woman with a four-character name

850
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,240
An artist with a four-character name

851
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
I can only think of two

852
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Starting with me, Dilraba

853
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,480
Dilraba has nine characters

854
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,960
Huang Zihongfan

855
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,800
Modern Brothers

856
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,480
I got it

857
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Haier Brothers

858
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,400
They're artists

859
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,080
You can play it like this?

860
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Crayon Shin-chan

861
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,760
Doraemon

862
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,720
Black Cat Detective

863
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,800
Hello Kitty

864
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,560
My Little Pony

865
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,320
Love, Death & Robots

866
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Legend of Love Huan

867
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,480
What is it? What thing?

868
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,160
Legend of the Fairy Sword and Love

869
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,240
Also Love Princess

870
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
I have five fans

871
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,240
How many fans do you have?

872
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
One, two, three, four, five, six fans

873
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,080
Ning, the lightbulb

874
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,240
You're not simple

875
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll let you live

876
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,080
Can you prove I'm not the murderer?

877
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm really not

878
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,920
The sky is calm, there's no wind or rain

879
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,200
and the sun shines above.

880
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,480
You stay silent, not saying a word,

881
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,400
so I wonder what's on your mind.

882
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,520
I'll sing a little longer to give you time to think.

883
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,280
Love is like a clear, cloudless sky.

884
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,240
Love is like the blue sky and white clouds, clear and boundless.

885
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,400
Yes, I'll sing.

886
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,880
The sun shines in the sky, the flowers smile at me.

887
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,760
The little birds say good morning.

888
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,320
Why are you carrying your little backpack?

889
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,160
The sparrow outside the window

890
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,760
is chattering on the utility pole.

891
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,680
The sky outside the window

892
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,000
You said this line really feels like summer.

893
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
I just didn't sing that word yet.

894
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
Dead.

895
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
Who died?

896
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,480
Little Gold Spoon.

897
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,960
Shouldn't you be crying your eyes out right now?

898
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Shouldn't the one who should be crying

899
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,480
be Ning?

900
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,360
He personally

901
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,680
killed his comrade.

902
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,360
At this moment,

903
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,880
doesn't he know everyone is watching him?

904
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
If he happens to be here himself,

905
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,840
look at me, the murderer today,

906
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,760
I really played the role well.

907
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,160
He's not stupid.

908
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,840
There are cameras here.

909
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,360
The rain keeps falling, it's so hard.

910
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,800
I'm just terrible at singing games.

911
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,680
That's hilarious.

912
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm locked in here, right?

913
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,600
Help!

914
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,080
Help!

915
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,120
Can you see me?

916
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,520
Help!

917
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,520
Save me!

918
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,960
Just stay there.

919
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,600
You'll be out in a bit.

920
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,160
Run quickly.

921
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,440
Actually, it's a bit dangerous for you to go out later.

922
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,160
Then I won't go.

923
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,960
Because you don't have this.

924
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,400
Seriously.

925
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
Then you go, I'll wait here for you.

926
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,680
If they see you come out, they'll go after you hard.

927
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
I'll just say you're my big brother.

928
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,160
It's fine, stick with me, I'll protect you.

929
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,200
If I'd known, I wouldn't have come either.

930
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
Why did I even come here?

931
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
I can protect you.

932
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,080
Don't worry, come with me.

933
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,000
We're already here anyway.

934
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,080
Or maybe you should just go back later.

935
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,880
We still have to wait for this elevator.

936
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,920
It was so hard for me to die.

937
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,000
And now you want me to go back.

938
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,320
What if he tries to take me away?

939
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
He can't take you away.

940
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,240
I'll tell him right away.

941
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,080
This is my good buddy, you can't take him.

942
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,040
He said he only recognizes badges, not people.

943
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
Do you see these three words? Do you know what they are?

944
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm in charge, understand?

945
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,640
I've already fired him.

946
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
Alright.

947
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,200
Then let Brother Ning say it directly.

948
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,280
Have him "executed."

949
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,960
"Executed."

950
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,600
Okay.

951
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,280
Alright.

952
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,320
What is this place?

953
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,320
Welcome to "Every Door Counts"

954
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,840
Please open every door

955
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Look for the exit

956
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Guess the line from the picture

957
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,120
This is

958
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I've never seen someone so shameless

959
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Isn't that right?

960
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,239
That's not right.

961
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,719
I've never seen anyone so shameless in my life.

962
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
That's not right.

963
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,719
Since that's not right,

964
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,600
let's try this first.

965
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,400
You're just scaring yourself.

966
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,800
This

967
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,440
I can't do it

968
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,640
It's really fun.

969
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,080
Actually, this "Slaughter" livestream room

970
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
is quite interesting too.

971
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,040
Is what's on here fake?

972
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
What is this?

973
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Let me take a photo of you two, okay?

974
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,120
Take good care of my great-uncle.

975
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,320
Haha, no.

976
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,040
What's this?

977
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
This one too.

978
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,800
I haven't seen this one either.

979
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
I haven't seen this one either.

980
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,520
Is there another way?

981
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,520
Wait.

982
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,280
Wait.

983
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,040
So pitiful.

984
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,320
This

985
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,120
There's no way through here.

986
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,200
Go back the way we came.

987
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,640
Are you kidding me? There's no door.

988
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,800
Let's find the real exit.

989
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,120
Let's find the real exit.

990
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,880
Let's find the real exit.

991
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,160
Is anyone there?

992
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
It's still this door.

993
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,320
You're alive.

994
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,040
My good brothers.

995
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,440
Let's go, let's go.

996
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
Hurry, let's go.

997
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,920
You don't really know what's going on right now, do you?

998
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
We've been messing around here for half an hour.

999
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,480
I'll take a picture of everyone.

1000
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,160
They're all ignoring me.

1001
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
Even when I take his picture, he ignores me.

1002
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,240
No, what's wrong?

1003
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,440
He has a big problem right now.

1004
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,480
He doesn't have any problems.

1005
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Do I have a problem?

1006
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,680
I don't know.

1007
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,160
You tell us yourself. Explain.

1008
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,840
I'm really pure.

1009
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,880
You're really pure.

1010
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,920
Pure.

1011
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,000
I originally thought you didn't have any problems at all.

1012
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,560
But since you insist on saying you're pure,

1013
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,840
I can't really take it.

1014
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm going to vote for you.

1015
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,480
I'll take a picture of you.

1016
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,280
I realized you look best when I take your picture.

1017
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,640
I'll zoom in a bit more.

1018
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
One, two.

1019
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,240
Your face really suits this style.

1020
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,240
Why?

1021
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,600
It looks better a bit blurry.

1022
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,040
If it's too high definition, you don't look as handsome.

1023
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Can you wait until I have the shot lined up before taking the picture?

1024
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
She really does take good photos.

1025
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,280
No, you're the one who's good at it.

1026
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,080
You take really good pictures.

1027
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,920
Why?

1028
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
Is it because you find the right angle?

1029
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Or is it because...

1030
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,600
I don't know.

1031
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
I just capture you the way I see you.

1032
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,960
That's how I take photos.

1033
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,760
Here, you take one.

1034
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,080
Let me see how you see me.

1035
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,240
You can make him look really ugly.

1036
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,200
I'm afraid you'll get mad.

1037
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
I won't get mad, don't worry.

1038
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,000
Go ahead, just take the picture.

1039
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,200
I just want to see, in your eyes,

1040
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
what kind of person I am.

1041
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,120
Let me take a look.

1042
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,560
Just as I thought.

1043
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,520
Just as I thought, good.

1044
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
So in your eyes, I'm this ugly.

1045
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,160
That's right.

1046
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,560
You didn't pose well yourself.

1047
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
You posed yourself.

1048
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
My expression was totally normal.

1049
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,400
I don't know how she managed to take

1050
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
a photo like this.

1051
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,600
That's exactly how I see him.

1052
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,360
Where should I put this?

1053
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
Didn't you lose hair after your pregnancy?

1054
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,480
I did lose hair.

1055
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,200
But it all grew back.

1056
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
It grew back after my postpartum confinement.

1057
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
No, I just noticed it now.

1058
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I have a layer of very short hair now.

1059
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,400
That means the lost hair has grown back.

1060
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,560
Right.

1061
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,120
That's good, isn't it?

1062
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,480
Do you have anything that can help?

1063
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
Can you check my pulse again?

1064
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,840
See if I've gotten better today.

1065
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,560
I've been working hard to get better these days.

1066
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Put it down, put it on the table.

1067
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,720
No need.

1068
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,440
I can't feel it.

1069
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
I've also learned how to take a pulse.

1070
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,280
Really?

1071
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Because I'm also playing a doctor.

1072
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,560
An ancient doctor.

1073
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,040
You're still very weak.

1074
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,800
Why are you always checking pulses?

1075
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,120
Are you checking his pulse?

1076
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,680
I just want to see if he's actually healthy

1077
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,760
or not healthy.

1078
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,720
I'm not healthy.

1079
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,000
No need to check mine, I admit it.

1080
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,520
Do you know yesterday,

1081
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,880
the way you lay on the bed was classic?

1082
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,600
It's because you were lying there so

1083
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,320
shrunken, you know?

1084
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,240
And you didn't move at all, you know?

1085
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,120
Both his hands were still...

1086
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,600
When someone is thinking really hard,

1087
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,560
you don't care about your posture.

1088
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,080
And your body doesn't want to move.

1089
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,680
Because only this part can move.

1090
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,480
We're up, let's go.

1091
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Go.

1092
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,200
Let's go.

1093
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,320
Slow down.

1094
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,520
We look like that...

1095
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,640
a fashion photoshoot.

1096
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,880
Actually, this works.

1097
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,320
We can take a crisscross photo like this.

1098
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah.

1099
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,920
Quick, someone take a picture of us.

1100
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,640
Actually, from up there,

1101
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,880
the photo can turn out well too.

1102
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,320
Look, there's one up there.

1103
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,480
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1104
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
This one.

1105
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,040
Right?

1106
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,840
But this angle doesn't look that good.

1107
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,040
You two, move a bit forward.

1108
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,000
Move up, or you won't fit in the frame.

1109
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,360
We can get a little closer.

1110
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,480
Yeah, a bit closer together.

1111
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,080
But not too close.

1112
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,160
If it's too close, it loses the vibe.

1113
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,840
It won't have that sense of distance.

1114
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,280
A sense of distance.

1115
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,960
Or we could each stand three meters apart.

1116
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,640
That would feel really distant.

1117
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,920
Are you posing now?

1118
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,840
Come up with something fun.

1119
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,080
I'm not asking you to pose, bro.

1120
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,000
Just think of something fun.

1121
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,960
Not posing.

1122
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,080
What's fun about it?

1123
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,960
It's that we're all here crawling on our knees.

1124
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,560
And then we just keep crawling forward.

1125
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,920
And then after a while,

1126
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,080
our heads pop out, our heads pop out.

1127
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,120
This kind of alternation.

1128
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,400
This would be perfect for shooting a music video.

1129
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,240
What kind of storyline?

1130
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,840
These few people.

1131
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
A Faye Wong music video.

1132
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,760
Your little purple eyeshadow is exactly that style.

1133
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,120
I'm telling you,

1134
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,640
Yeah.

1135
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,320
Your eyeshadow looks so good.

1136
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,000
It does.

1137
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,920
The makeup artist today—

1138
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,560
Nice.

1139
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,400
Suddenly wanted to try this color.

1140
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,800
You look great with this kind of light color.

1141
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,240
Photographer, can you take a picture of us?

1142
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,040
Yes, just like this. Come on.

1143
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,000
Coming.

1144
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,920
Teacher, I feel like I've seen this pose somewhere before.

1145
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, look over here, everyone.

1146
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,040
Do you all want to look at me together for the photo?

1147
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,640
Shall we do that?

1148
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,280
Yes.

1149
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,840
Sure.

1150
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,640
Alright.

1151
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,840
Right, let's adjust a little like this.

1152
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,840
Let's bunch up a bit, get closer together.

1153
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,640
Let's get even closer.

1154
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,320
Spread out, and we're like a sky full of stars.

1155
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,760
Spread out.

1156
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,680
Or we're like a bunch of matches.

1157
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,800
No, I mean you...

1158
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,000
Your legs look eight and a half meters long.

1159
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,680
Very good.

1160
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,280
Okay, let's look forward and take another one.

1161
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,920
Let's take one last photo.

1162
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,480
Three, two, one.

1163
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,040
Where should the murderer sit?

1164
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,760
You two detectives,

1165
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,080
Murderer, you sit in the middle. Murderer.

1166
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,760
Why are you saying this now?

1167
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,920
You look just like the murderer to me.

1168
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,520
Alright.

1169
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,640
Sit.

1170
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,400
Don't try to control me, I'm telling you.

1171
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm a distinguished murderer, you know.

1172
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,840
Now you're suddenly turning the question back on me.

1173
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,080
I wasn't suspicious of you at first.

1174
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
But now you're making me doubt.

1175
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,800
Alright, you know it in your heart.

1176
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,320
Let me hear it.

1177
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,000
As soon as I came out, he called me the murderer.

1178
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,240
Murderer, come sit. You sit right in the middle.

1179
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,800
It's really strange.

1180
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,920
Is it easy to guess the murderer today?

1181
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
It's really easy to guess the murderer today.

1182
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
Just by looking at his face,

1183
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,480
he looks like he doesn't have the energy to lie.

1184
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,440
Now you're saying I'm the murderer.

1185
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,400
And you say he doesn't have the energy to lie.

1186
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,360
So what are you, then?

1187
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,840
I'm a "Bai Ke."

1188
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,040
You've joined our "Bai Ke" operation too.

1189
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,480
Yes.

1190
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,720
You two, stop talking to each other.

1191
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,080
The way you two are looking at each other so intently

1192
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,040
makes me feel like something's off.

1193
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,440
There's no way I'm the murderer today.

1194
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,200
The way you're looking at me like that—

1195
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,440
Alright.

1196
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,560
Hey, my board is with you.

1197
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,120
It's with you.

1198
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,920
It's with me.

1199
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,760
It's with you.

1200
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,560
Thanks, sweetie.

1201
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,840
Wait a second.

1202
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,920
Then where's my board?

1203
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,320
Teacher.

1204
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,720
What's going on?

1205
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh no.

1206
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,120
It's in the cafeteria.

1207
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,240
Ba Fen Tang

1208
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:16,920
See, I told you.

1209
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,360
You have a bag but don't use it, so I put the board in.

1210
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,480
You said I don't need to use that for my board.

1211
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,160
I can just carry it myself.

1212
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,240
But my board ended up in the bag.

1213
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,600
Your own board.

1214
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,240
My board is with him.

1215
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,880
Thank you.

1216
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,440
You're welcome.

1217
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,440
It's fine.

1218
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,600
How could it not matter?

1219
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,200
No, I just think for this case,

1220
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,840
it doesn't really matter if I lose.

1221
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,160
I was just hurt by him.

1222
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,040
I just feel it's a bit

1223
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,280
unimportant.

1224
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,320
Being hurt doesn't matter.

1225
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,240
What matters is that we lost.

1226
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,680
So in your mind,

1227
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,240
winning or losing is just as important as being hurt.

1228
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
So actually, that's kind of scary.

1229
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,440
Yeah.

1230
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,640
If you get stuck

1231
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,600
in a certain way of thinking,

1232
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,680
and you don't step back to look at it,

1233
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,320
no matter how much people shout at you, you won't listen, you know?

1234
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,440
No, because even if someone tries to stop you, they can't.

1235
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah.

1236
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,600
About his state,

1237
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,640
I think he seemed very relaxed today.

1238
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,360
And then I just felt

1239
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,120
Okay.

1240
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,000
Why do you think he was relaxed?

1241
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,040
I don't really know him.

1242
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:04,960
It's fine.

1243
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,960
So now it proves I don't know him either.

1244
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,880
His kind of relaxed is like yesterday, like that.

1245
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,120
Right.

1246
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,640
That's what you call relaxed.

1247
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,320
That's called relaxed.

1248
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,440
Today he tried too hard.

1249
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,600
So when we were figuring out

1250
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,680
that method of committing the crime,

1251
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,000
you weren't listening at all.

1252
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,480
Your method, right?

1253
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah.

1254
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,200
I just told a joke.

1255
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,320
I said I'd vote for Zhang Linghe every round this season.

1256
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,160
That way, at least I'd get it right sometimes, right?

1257
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,560
I almost thought the same today.

1258
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,600
Lao Bai, you really let me down.

1259
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,080
You didn't remind me, not even for a second, and say,

1260
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,520
"Ning, you're too 'dumb.'"

1261
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,720
I believed in you from start to finish.

1262
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,640
Good brothers, live and die together.

1263
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,200
Okay.

1264
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,120
So you didn't take the key either.

1265
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,000
Next time.

1266
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
Next time, if you're the killer,

1267
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,720
give me a signal.

1268
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,120
Okay.

1269
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,360
I'll vote with you against someone else.

1270
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,920
Okay.

1271
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,280
That's really sad.

1272
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,480
What's there to be sad about?

1273
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,400
Shouldn't you be happy?

1274
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,240
I know you so well.

1275
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,800
What I want is blind trust, that's all.

1276
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,840
Like Ning does.

1277
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,720
It's about crazy, unconditional trust in your brothers.

1278
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,280
Crazy, unconditional trust in your brothers.

1279
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,760
Yeah.

1280
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,800
That's what brothers are.

1281
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,880
Say no more, don't say anything.

1282
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,560
Don't say anything.

1283
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,720
I just trust you.

1284
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,480
Don't say anything else.

1285
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,280
Yeah, whoever you say we go after, we go after.

1286
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,680
It's that simple.

1287
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,320
It's that simple.

1288
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,840
There's nothing I can do.

1289
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,240
Frustrated.

1290
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,840
You're way too frustrated, bro.

1291
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,480
Let me tell you where you made the wrong move.

1292
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,960
You didn't defend yourself at the end.

1293
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,360
You didn't show me your attitude.

1294
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,240
I told you.

1295
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,800
If I had defended myself at the end,

1296
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,240
you would have used that defense against me.

1297
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,000
It's because of your defense, I think—

1298
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,560
No, I wouldn't.

1299
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,120
I'm exactly the same as yesterday.

1300
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,560
I was thinking about what you said to defend yourself.

1301
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,000
You didn't.

1302
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,320
You kept saying, "Yeah, that's me, fine?"

1303
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,040
So I should just say, "Yeah, that's me"?

1304
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,080
No.

1305
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,800
Just say, "No, that's not me."

1306
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,440
Right.

1307
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,440
Okay, fine, I'll do that next time.

1308
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,080
Just say it's not.

1309
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,600
Your vibe is just a bit

1310
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,880
crazier.

1311
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,720
A bit crazier.

1312
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,640
Yeah, like you're being driven crazy.

1313
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,960
He's already pretty relaxed.

1314
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,840
We're about to be—

1315
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,760
We're about to go crazy.

1316
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,840
Act a bit crazier.

1317
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,440
Yeah.

1318
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,760
Show me your "crazy," let me see.

1319
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,640
Honestly, I can't really do it either.

1320
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,520
I'm not very good at it.

1321
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,920
It's like how you really feel right now.

1322
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,760
He drove you "crazy."

1323
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,040
That's right.

1324
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,840
The lights are about to go off.

1325
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,160
Okay, three, two, one.

1326
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Only Teacher Jin Jing will perform here.

1327
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Come, watch me, come.

1328
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,640
Come, watch me, again.

1329
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,960
You know there's a mirror in front of me.

1330
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,720
I saw in the mirror

1331
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,160
that everyone looks handsome and beautiful.

1332
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,720
Except for myself.

1333
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,520
How about you do a move for us to learn?

1334
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:32,840
Come on.

1335
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,080
Come on.

1336
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,440
Okay.

1337
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,640
Teacher Jin Jing, tone it down a bit.

1338
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,800
Alright, thank you all for your hard work.

1339
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,240
This "sword" is cool.

1340
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,000
Check this out, bro.

1341
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,800
That's a lighter.

1342
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
Mine's just a plastic case, bro.

1343
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,000
This is my little pet.

1344
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,080
Is it heavy?

1345
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,520
It's a bit heavy.

1346
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:55,880
Can you hold it for me?

1347
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,400
No.

1348
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,160
Just touch it.

1349
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,800
It's not a big deal.

1350
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,160
No, no.

1351
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,120
What's "head"?

1352
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,920
What do you mean, "don't want"?

1353
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,400
Ke Dance King, what are you dancing?

1354
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Dance King, what are you doing, Dance King?

1355
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,000
We're all following you, Dance King.

1356
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,480
Hurry up and introduce yourself.

1357
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,400
I'm Jin Shangbao.

1358
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Do you have any special abilities?

1359
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,720
Me? I just radiate charm.

1360
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,600
I make others fall in love with me.

1361
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,600
Look into my eyes.

1362
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,960
In real life,

1363
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,400
is there anyone who talks to you without getting distracted?

1364
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,040
I think today's NPC teachers

1365
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,880
if any of them try to scare us,

1366
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,640
they'd better watch out.

1367
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,800
Because we all came with "weapons".

1368
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,600
Actually, everyone can

1369
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,640
put their "weapons"

1370
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,520
aside now.

1371
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,000
That won't do.

1372
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,800
That won't do.

1373
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,600
How could that work?

1374
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,960
Even if it's uncomfortable, I still have to keep it.

1375
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,240
What do you want to do to us?

1376
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,600
This part will be aired as an episode.

1377
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,720
The chili in your mouth is biting you.

1378
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,360
It's tasty.

1379
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,760
Check for me again.

1380
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,080
See if I'm feeling better today.
