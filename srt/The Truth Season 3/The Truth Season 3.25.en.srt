1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,120
The boss is dead.

2
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,280
Ren Weishan disappeared at 11:20.

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,040
The two of us are exactly the same.

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,480
Mine is exactly the same as his.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm exactly the same as him too.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,240
There's a difference.

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
We are all numbered test subjects.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
I found out the boss wanted to kill me.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,240
I turned the tables and killed him instead.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,840
I want to kill him.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,920
I must get revenge.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,480
Could Ren Weishan have intentions toward the butler...

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,440
...and try to do something inappropriate?

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Ren Weishan.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,600
He caused my father's death.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,320
So who among you is the real killer?

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Because each of you contacted me.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,520
Let's go search the second area.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,200
Right, hurry.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's talk as we walk.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,480
But there's a problem.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,000
But there's a problem.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,280
Go ahead.

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,680
I am X.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,320
I am X.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,440
What?

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,400
And then?

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
So who among you is the real killer?

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
Because each of you contacted me.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,480
What are you all doing?

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
I feel terrible.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Wait a moment.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
Why did everyone message me?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Nuannuan, it's me.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,560
She should know who I am now.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
Hello, beautiful.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Want to play together?

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
This way, she'll definitely know it's me.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Say who you're voting for.

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,880
I think it's either He or Ning.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
I feel really sorry for her.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Alright.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,720
The messiest ever.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
Does anyone do X like this?

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
Everyone has been contacted.

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,320
What are you guys doing?

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,920
Who are you?

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Got it, I understand.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
I understand.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
I admit it.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,360
Since she said it,

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
I admit I contacted her.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,600
I think I'm the murderer.

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
You must also think you're the murderer.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
You also think you're the murderer.

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,960
You definitely also think you're the murderer.

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,320
I think so too.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,080
You think so too.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
So among the five of us,

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,720
only one person

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,560
is the one who actually killed him.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,600
We all took action.

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
We all did something.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
For example, I slapped him.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,800
Right.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Who was the one who finally caused his death?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
That's the murderer.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,560
Come on, let's search.

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:24,960
Come on.

70
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Let's search first.

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Let's go to the banquet hall first.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,720
There's still one computer that hasn't been turned on.

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,360
It's in 201.

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
I'll go get it.

75
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
Internal chat system.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
Password.

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,800
Shenhun Dian Island.

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,440
Shen Hun Dian Island.

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,920
Incorrect password.

80
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,560
You try.

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:01,960
Go ahead.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,760
Enrapt Island

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,840
enrapt (enraptured)

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
"Enraptured" in English

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,000
enrapt (enraptured)

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,440
enrapt (enraptured)

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
d6

88
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,640
Enrapt Island Development Plan

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Top secret of the Tuixian Group

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
April 2000

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Okay, got it.

92
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
E N R A P T

93
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
2000

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay.

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
Search keywords

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Ren Weishan

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
Let's search for Ren Weishan first, okay?

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay.

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,520
No keywords found.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
What other keywords can we search for?

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Search for "Fluorescent Man"

102
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
"Fluorescent Man" is a name we gave him ourselves.

103
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,070
Just search for "the killer."

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
My father went to an island

105
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
to research stem cells.

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Search for my dad, Professor Ke.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
Professor Ke really does have it.

108
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,960
I found that the longhorn beetles on the island

109
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,200
and the clams in the sea all have abnormal development.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,800
They are unusually large in size.

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,440
After testing,

112
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,280
it should be due to our experiment

113
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,760
causing side effects.

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,880
Ren Weishan said

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
this situation has existed since 2005.

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,400
Don't worry about it.

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,880
If accidentally eaten, it can also result in

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,800
a rejuvenating effect on the body.

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
But it also causes symptoms of organ failure.

120
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,440
The body becomes younger,

121
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
but the organs still fail.

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,160
Right.

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
How does that even work?

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
It just uses you up ahead of time.

125
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Is there more?

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
Next page, there's another page.

127
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,920
Ling Ling Fa said the boss is in trouble.

128
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Just now, Professor Ke drugged us.

129
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,640
After making us pass out, he secretly escaped.

130
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,320
We found on his phone that he sent the island's location

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,080
and a tip-off message to the outside.

132
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
Now get rid of him.

133
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Will this have a big impact on the stem cell research?

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,920
The latest stem cells

135
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
have almost no side effects now.

136
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
There hasn't been any memory loss recently.

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,560
Or sudden weight loss.

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
So you've taken this stuff too?

139
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Because I lose my memory once every six months.

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,320
Although his technology

141
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,960
is better than our previous research team's,

142
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,480
it broke the previous "Fountain of Youth" research

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,080
that caused organ failure in five to ten years.

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,480
But he discovered our secret.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,400
So we can't let him stay.

146
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Hurry up and do it.

147
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Boss, it's done.

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,720
I've already given him a slow-acting poison.

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,480
He won't live long.

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,880
Notify everyone to gather.

151
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,360
This island and these test subjects

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
can't be kept either.

153
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
So after learning this information,

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,840
my butler

155
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,720
gave me that fake identity and let me leave.

156
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,840
Six years ago, my butler

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
suddenly handed me an information sheet

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,040
and told me to live under this new identity.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
I was completely confused.

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
If anyone has seen this computer,

161
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,120
it must be you.

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Because your hometown is the year 2000,

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
which was taken over by them.

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Starting from the year 2000,

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,160
this island

166
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
will throw all the old, weak, sick, and disabled into the sea.

167
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,320
He took over your hometown.

168
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,280
Alright, now you're starting to give yourself away.

169
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,480
Is this giving myself away?

170
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
If you think this is giving yourself away,

171
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,160
then I have to

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
then I have to flatter you.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
Flatter you.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,320

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
8745

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes

193
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,520
Showing symptoms of amnesia

194
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,400
Must be found and executed as soon as possible

195
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
Body emits fluorescence

196
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
Rapid weight loss

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
This is my butler

198
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,880
Niu Da

199
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,360
This person is forty years old

200
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,880
She disappeared at forty

201
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Disappeared in December 2019

202
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,080
What's the name

203
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
CA7749

204
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
Fluorescent, fluorescent person

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Niu Da and another fluorescent person

206
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
So he saw two

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
One of them is a woman

208
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Fluorescent person

209
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,280
We're all numbered test subjects

210
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,910
Qi Ji

211
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,790
Number

212
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,790
CA7749

213
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,080
Qi (Ji)

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Yes, that's her.

215
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
That's your wife.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
So my wife is still alive.

217
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
My wife was born in 1980.

218
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,200
Since she's alive,

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
why doesn't she just come in?

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,240
And reunite with him.

221
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,880
She must have a reason she can't do that.

222
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,960
I think it's your wife.

223
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,960
One is my father, the other is your wife.

224
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,000
CA7749

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Name

226
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,760
Qi Ji

227
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,960
Wait a second.

228
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,360
Then search for A7749.

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,880
A7749

230
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Right, she was once A.

231
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
Check when she arrived.

232
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,560
Okay.

233
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
She had many children.

234
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,560
D6

235
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,280
That's me.

236
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,040
It's you.

237
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,280
D6, you are him.

238
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,800
You are the child my wife had with someone else.

239
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes.

240
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
I've been looking for my wife for nineteen years.

241
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Nineteen years.

242
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
Your dad is Ren (Weishan).

243
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,880
Is your dad even human?

244
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
You two have the same mother but different fathers.

245
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
We have the same mother and the same father.

246
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,960
Different fathers.

247
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
She's my daughter.

248
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,640
You are Ren Weishan's daughter.

249
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,760
Daughter.

250
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes.

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
Same mother, different fathers.

252
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,440
Qi Ji's genes are really good.

253
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,400
Look, the daughter is this one, the son is this one.

254
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,760
Check this note.

255
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
See what the note says.

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
Experiment management regulations.

257
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,200
A is black market abduction.

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
Women obtained through unconventional means.

259
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,400
Excellent genes and physical condition.

260
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,120
Purpose is for reproduction.

261
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,200
To provide children with the same blood type and genes as Ren Weishan.

262
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Children with the same blood type and genes.

263
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Used as a resource pool for Ren Weishan to regain youth.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,120
B is the abandoned baby tower.

265
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
That's where I was abandoned.

266
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Purpose is to extract stem cells.

267
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,360
Used as research subjects for various experiments.

268
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,760
C is black market abduction.

269
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,720
Unconventional means.

270
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,240
Obtained elderly, middle-aged, and young people.

271
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,360
D is children bred for a specific purpose.

272
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Used for extracting stem cells.

273
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
For injections for Ren Weishan.

274
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,840
To establish a personal exclusive gene pool.

275
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
So she wasn't just for having children.

276
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
She was to help him stay young.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes.

278
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
April 2000

279
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
Shenhundian Island Development Plan

280
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,240
Eliminate worthless indigenous people

281
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Strict imprisonment and control

282
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,400
Young and healthy adults

283
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,960
My father went to an island

284
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
to research stem cells

285
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,040
He told me

286
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
that some activities on the island

287
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
were actually illegal experiments

288
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,200
My housekeeper was

289
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,920
turned into a failed test subject

290
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,640
We were all numbered test subjects

291
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,960
used as a resource pool for Ren Weishan's rejuvenation

292
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
To make these people immortal

293
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,760
they would extract things from us

294
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,720
take things

295
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,600
so they could live forever

296
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,960
They all died

297
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,240
Understood

298
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,920
He deserves to die

299
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,560
He really deserves to die

300
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,400
Here's an autopsy report

301
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,680
Autopsy report

302
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
Ren Weishan, male, sixty years old

303
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,840
After thorough examination

304
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,680
and ruling out external environmental factors

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
the time of death can be determined

306
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,640
as March 14, 2025

307
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,600
between 11:00 and before 12:00

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,640
A heavy blow to the head

309
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,800
caused fatal intracranial bleeding

310
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,680
Wait, let's check the time first

311
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,640
11:00 to 12:00

312
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,480
Then we all have alibis

313
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
The three of us were all watching him.

314
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
He stayed in the room the whole time.

315
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Did those two see him leave early?

316
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
If he left early,

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
then it matches his time of death.

318
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,080
Yes.

319
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,160
We were there too, with you.

320
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,760
But the problem is, he left.

321
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,520
But the two of us were here playing cards with you.

322
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,160
We played all night and took photos.

323
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,760
At 11:20.

324
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,960
Then when we turned around,

325
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Ren Weishan was gone.

326
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,880
The five of us ate for another forty minutes.

327
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,600
Then we all went back together.

328
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,360
Wait a second.

329
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,720
Let me write this down, it's so confusing.

330
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,360
My notebook.

331
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,000
Here.

332
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,520
Thank you.

333
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
Unless

334
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
she's actually the killer.

335
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Who, me?

336
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
Because you left at 11:20.

337
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,680
Immediately identify the culprit.

338
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
You're the killer.

339
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,640
You're the only one with the opportunity.

340
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Would a detective commit murder?

341
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,160
I'm speechless.

342
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,440
After all this time,

343
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
five people are accusing one detective.

344
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
And it's me.

345
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,560
You five are the detectives.

346
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,600
And I'm the killer.

347
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,320
Alright.

348
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
That means our timeline is wrong.

349
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
It definitely can't be like this.

350
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,640
How is that possible?

351
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Then our timing must be off.

352
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,000
There's a problem with the timing.

353
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,360
I couldn't possibly have killed him.

354
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Why?

355
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,320
Because I knew he wanted to kill me.

356
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Because he knew

357
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,480
I was going to

358
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
silence me.

359
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,360
So if I didn't go to kill him,

360
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,800
wouldn't it be better if I just ran away?

361
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,040
Because he hurt you

362
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,920
for the first half of your life,

363
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,160
and hurt your girlfriend too.

364
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
I didn't know about any of this.

365
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
I lose my memory every six months.

366
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,640
Wait a minute.

367
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
Then let me ask you,

368
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
if you didn't kill anyone,

369
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,200
why did you contact her?

370
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,360
You've already decided she's X.

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
So there must be a reason.

372
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
How did you kill him, that part—

373
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,280
You think you're not a suspect now,

374
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,560
so tell us about that part.

375
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,880
Okay.

376
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
We'll help you rule it out.

377
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,560
Alright.

378
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,240
Go ahead.

379
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,280
How did you kill him?

380
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,600
What was the process of killing him?

381
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,920
The process of killing him was—

382
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Say it.

383
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,120
Tell us.

384
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,520
Go on.

385
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Speak.

386
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Say it.

387
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,240
I think we should play a bold round.

388
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,520
If you're sure you're not the killer,

389
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
then just say that part out loud.

390
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,600
You go first and set an example.

391
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,640
Right?

392
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,120
Let us hear it.

393
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,000
How would you commit the murder?

394
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
You take the lead.

395
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
No, you can't say it.

396
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,760
Because right now,

397
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,400
it's like a window paper that can't be pierced.

398
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
Because

399
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,920
at this very moment,

400
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,400
if you say it,

401
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,280
we won't know who's telling the truth.

402
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,720
Right.

403
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
But I think there's a key point.

404
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,240
The cause of death

405
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,920
has already been revealed.

406
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,960
He was struck heavily.

407
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,680
So if your method of killing

408
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
was poisoning

409
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,600
or strangling him,

410
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm telling you,

411
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,240
all five people were struck heavily.

412
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,440
Yes, after he was struck hard,

413
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
no one came forward to say

414
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
"I was the one who poisoned him."

415
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,440
This person was hit five times.

416
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,800
Everyone entered the room

417
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,880
and gave him a hit.

418
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,760
Let's see which blow

419
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,080
was the fatal one.

420
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
No, but there's a problem.

421
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,760
It's definitely not that after five hits,

422
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,680
he didn't die from the first hit,

423
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,080
not from the second,

424
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
not from the third,

425
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,600
and only died from the fifth.

426
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,280
Do you understand?

427
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,440
Yes, I do.

428
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,800
So I think

429
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
we still need to look for something else.

430
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,920
Okay.

431
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,840
Wait a moment.

432
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,400
This is what we ate yesterday.

433
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,360
The leftovers.

434
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,280
One, two, three, four, five, six...

435
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,160
Seven bowls.

436
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,440
This proves

437
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,120
that person really was here yesterday.

438
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,040
He ate with us.

439
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,000
It wasn't our imagination.

440
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
This can be confirmed now.

441
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes.

442
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,400
Wait a moment.

443
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,240
I have something here.

444
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I just picked up a photo.

445
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,080
There's an instant camera here.

446
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,560
There's a time on it.

447
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,600
One is 22:30.

448
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,360
Are we all around thirty?

449
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,360
Another is 23:20.

450
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,760
This is the time Ba left.

451
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,480
Wait a second.

452
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
When we arrived, the tea was full.

453
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
By the time Ba left, only this much tea was left.

454
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,520
Guys,

455
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
I found a manual for the aroma diffuser.

456
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,080
The aroma diffuser needs to be plugged in to work.

457
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,440
It uses up one level of aroma liquid every thirty minutes.

458
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,240
Take a closer look at the aroma diffuser.

459
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,040
Aroma diffuser.

460
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
The time of death was between

461
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
eleven and before twelve.

462
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Then we all have alibis.

463
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,600
There's a problem with our timeline.

464
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
When we arrived, the tea was full.

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
By the time Ba left, only this much tea was left.

466
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,920
It uses up one level of aroma liquid every thirty minutes.

467
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
This is used to calculate the time.

468
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,200
Understood.

469
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
This mark is one.

470
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,760
Each segment represents half an hour.

471
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,520
The first photo shows it at full.

472
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
That means it started at 10:30.

473
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
So let's count from there.

474
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,560
This is 11:00.

475
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,720
11:30, 12:00, 12:30.

476
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,440
But you cut the power at 12:00.

477
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Around 12:00.

478
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,680
All the circuit switches inside

479
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,400
were turned off by me.

480
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,880
They need power to work.

481
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
So how did it move another segment?

482
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,320
Yes, that's the question now.

483
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes.

484
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,800
The time we spent here

485
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,920
might not be the actual time.

486
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,480
Could that be the case?

487
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
It should be after she left

488
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
that the time started to go wrong.

489
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,640
It got messed up.

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
The kettle's time is the accurate one.

491
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,560
The time we remember isn't accurate.

492
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,520
Yes.

493
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,320
The memory point in our minds

494
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,360
is forty minutes.

495
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,200
So why is there this difference?

496
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
That's a point of suspicion.

497
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,360
So how do we figure out this timeline?

498
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,640
Let's sort out the timeline first.

499
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,320
Detective, I'll help you write it down.

500
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,120
What we can confirm now

501
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,440
is that the time of death was at night,

502
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
between 11:00 and 11:59.

503
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,760
Right.

504
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,920
Left at midnight, right?

505
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
This is our statement.

506
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,040
This is the time from our statement.

507
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
Scent session time.

508
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,040
The scent session was

509
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
from 10:30

510
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,840
to 12:30.

511
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,440
Bai.

512
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,280
Jin.

513
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,480
Ke.

514
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,080
saw the person there the whole time.

515
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
Yes, when we left, he was still there.

516
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
Then He and Ning

517
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,400
saw the boss and Ba

518
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,680
disappear around the same time.

519
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,760
Right.

520
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
When we turned around, they were gone.

521
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,120
Wait, is the timeline confirmed?

522
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,320
This time of death

523
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,120
is definitely confirmed.

524
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,400
The time of death is confirmed.

525
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
And through the scent session,

526
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,960
that’s also definitely confirmed.

527
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,520
Is it possible that we

528
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,320
were hallucinating?

529
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes, that's right.

530
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
First, there are two suspicious points.

531
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
The first suspicious point is about our

532
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,520
the time when we started hallucinating.

533
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,440
This is a major point of suspicion.

534
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,960
Right.

535
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,920
The second suspicious point

536
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
is if this is the actual time of death,

537
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,200
and the time related to the fragrance,

538
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
and the fixed times we left and entered,

539
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,800
then none of us would be suspects.

540
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,680
Exactly.

541
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,720
So there must be a problem with this.

542
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
The timing of the fragrance must be correct.

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
Because it's an objective fact.

544
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
If that's the case,

545
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,200
only He and Ning could have committed the crime.

546
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,960
Our current timeline

547
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
is something we can all vouch for, right?

548
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,800
So, what time did we leave?

549
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,040
We left together at twelve thirty.

550
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
At that time, the boss

551
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,120
According to our statements, he was still there.

552
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,680
Right.

553
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,440
But according to you two, he was already gone.

554
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,840
So that means

555
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
the time of death

556
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
the only ones who weren't at the party then

557
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,040
were just you two.

558
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Do you understand what that means?

559
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
But those two were present the whole time.

560
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
I was playing poker with you.

561
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
Why do you keep forgetting this?

562
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,480
Even though the person was gone,

563
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
you saw that we were still there.

564
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,720
Yes.

565
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Then I want to ask,

566
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,360
if it's certain that the person

567
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
died at twelve o'clock,

568
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,000
then I can boldly

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,280
share some of my information.

570
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,560
Okay.

571
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,040
Go ahead.

572
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,640
I made my move at twelve forty-five.

573
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,560
What did you do?

574
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,120
I don't know if anyone can back me up.

575
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
If someone can,

576
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,080
then I'll dare to

577
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,160
I'll go with you. Me too.

578
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,120
Me too.

579
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,520
I only made my move after twelve thirty.

580
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,320
Me too, after twelve thirty.

581
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,840
Wait a minute.

582
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
What are your memories?

583
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,840
This is how I remember it.

584
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
After we left,

585
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,880
Are you sure you want to talk about this now?

586
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,680
Let's just talk about this part.

587
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,800
There's no other way, we have to go with this.

588
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
We have to say it.

589
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,480
Because things have stalled.

590
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
Okay.

591
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,640
Since she started, let's talk.

592
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,240
That's right.

593
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,720
This is how I remember it.

594
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,200
After we went back,

595
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Fifteen minutes passed.

596
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,520
The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.

597
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,640
I decided to go back.

598
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,520
Mine is one o'clock.

599
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,840
Yours is one o'clock.

600
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
After thirty minutes, you got angrier and angrier.

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,840
Yes.

602
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
Okay, who else? Next.

603
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
Mine is forty minutes.

604
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Mine is twenty minutes.

605
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,600
Mine is five minutes.

606
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,640
We're lining up these times.

607
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,600
What does it mean?

608
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,520
His time of death.

609
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,680
Between eleven and twelve.

610
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,040
Wait a moment.

611
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
If this time is real,

612
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,720
He died at this time.

613
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,880
So we killed him.

614
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Either it's the dead Ren Weishan,

615
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,720
or it's not Ren Weishan.

616
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,040
There's another question.

617
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,800
So, where did each of you kill him?

618
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,240
Right.

619
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,880
That's our next topic.

620
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Go ahead, you start.

621
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,440
The little garden in front of the door.

622
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,000
The little garden.

623
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
He was sitting on a bench.

624
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,600
I hit him hard with a flowerpot.

625
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,480
And then I finished him off.

626
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:03,800
No.

627
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,600
After you killed him,

628
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
where did you put the body?

629
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
I just dumped it.

630
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,080
Dumped it where?

631
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,160
In the river.

632
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,520
You dumped it in the river, right?

633
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,360
You dumped it in the river.

634
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Okay, your turn.

635
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,480
I knocked him out by the river.

636
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,360
Which riverbank?

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,320
The one where the body was found.

638
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,240
Right outside the iron gate.

639
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,840
That's right, outside the iron gate.

640
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
What did you use to kill him?

641
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,640
A blunt object.

642
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,120
Yes.

643
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,520
He.

644
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,560
I was in the corridor.

645
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
The corridor on the second floor.

646
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,960
He, what did you use to kill him?

647
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,000
I used something heavy.

648
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,640
Something heavy.

649
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,080
Okay, I...

650
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,600
I was at...

651
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
I killed him here.

652
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,560
Where are you? The banquet hall?

653
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:34,960
Here.

654
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Banquet hall.

655
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,800
I used a bottle.

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,680
I was in his room.

657
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
He was sitting on the sofa.

658
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
I hit him with something.

659
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680
Then I dragged him into the closet and locked it.

660
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,920
Then I used something heavy, a decoration.

661
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
No, how could his body move?

662
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,440
How did he die all over the place?

663
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
He died all over the place.

664
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Okay, the stolen goods.

665
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,840
Right, your murder weapon.

666
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,640
Murder weapon.

667
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,720
Where did the flowerpot go?

668
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,360
Let me ask you first.

669
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,680
Buried it.

670
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,080
Buried it under the tree.

671
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,360
It's okay, we'll look for it later.

672
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,080
Where's your stick?

673
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,280
Where did you bury your stick?

674
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,200
My stick, right?

675
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,840
Your stick.

676
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,720
Under my tree.

677
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
You both buried them in the same place.

678
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
Anyway, I buried it under the tree.

679
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,840
Where did you put it?

680
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
I’m at

681
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,840
under the car tire.

682
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,360
Where are you?

683
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,280
I’m under the red swing.

684
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,440
We’re in the same place.

685
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
I’m also under the swing.

686
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,560
I’ve got goosebumps.

687
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
So the one who’s alone

688
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
the person at the car tire

689
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,320
is alone in a different place.

690
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,040
How am I alone in a different place?

691
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,080
He’s starting to play dumb now.

692
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,000
I’m under the car tire next to the swing.

693
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,560
Is that good enough?

694
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,040
Yes.

695
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,200
Let’s let him try to talk his way out first.

696
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
You’re locking people up for no reason.

697
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
Let’s not lock anyone up yet.

698
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,360
Are we going to dig up the murder weapon?

699
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
Let’s dig.

700
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,480
If you don’t dig anything up,

701
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
it’s just an illusion.

702
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,760
If you dig up a real weapon,

703
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,200
that’s the murderer.

704
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,640
That’s possible.

705
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,520
Pretty much.

706
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,320
I’m sure I’m not an illusion.

707
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,800
I’m sure I’m not an illusion either.

708
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,360
People always

709
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,120
When people are “foolish,”

710
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,360
they never admit they’re “fools.”

711
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
That’s what I mean.

712
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,720
I’m not a “fool.”

713
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,840
Let’s go.

714
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,040
Let’s go.

715
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,720
I know why you suddenly froze.

716
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Because you already know who the real culprit is.

717
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,480
You’re helping him now.

718
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,520
You're a good person, you shouldn't be acting like this.

719
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,240
The main thing is, you all keep discussing it.

720
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
You're talking about where you did the killing.

721
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,520
How would I know where you did it?

722
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,680
You're overthinking it. She doesn't have any clues.

723
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,280
No, five people sent her messages.

724
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,800
Because everyone contacted her.

725
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,040
She still has to figure out who that person is.

726
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,920
Right.

727
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
I'm just like you.

728
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,960
If you're not the culprit, then I'm just like you right now.

729
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,320
Each of you claims to be the culprit.

730
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,200
Today, this is a confession game.

731
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,960
Jin is so cute.

732
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,120
Every time you want to say something but don't dare, that look on your face—

733
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,760
It's so cute.

734
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Come on, all you culprits.

735
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,920
Today, everyone really is a culprit.

736
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,840
No.

737
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,960
What are you all doing?

738
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
Did you investigate seriously?

739
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,320
Then who is that?

740
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,960
So what you saw was this dummy.

741
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,320
That's right.

742
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,720
Just now,

743
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,880
I had my subordinate

744
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,480
patrol by the river,

745
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,840
and they found this.

746
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,640
So I told them to fish it out.

747
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,920
Anyway, I looked at it for a long time,

748
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,680
but didn't notice anything suspicious.

749
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
Alright, I'll leave it to you.

750
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
Okay, no problem, leave it to us.

751
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
Alright, then we'll head out first.

752
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,560
Brother Fa, he—

753
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,320
About me fighting with him yesterday—

754
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,440
I didn't tell the boss.

755
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
No one say anything when we get back.

756
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,960
Let's go, quickly.

757
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,720
He didn't tell the boss

758
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,400
about you fighting with him.

759
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,080
He's Ling Ling Fa.

760
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,560
I know.

761
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,000
I knew he was Ling Ling Fa yesterday.

762
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And this, too.

763
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,680
Thank you.

764
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
Alright, let's dig first.

765
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,760
I can be sure it wasn't me.

766
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,800
Why?

767
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,560
In my memory,

768
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,600
there was green grass planted in that flowerpot.

769
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
But now it's a red plant.

770
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
It's the middle of the night.

771
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,800
Are you sure you saw the color clearly?

772
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,200
I'm one hundred percent sure.

773
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,640
Wait a second.

774
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
What's this? Isn't this a flowerpot?

775
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,280
Yes.

776
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,400
In my flowerpot before,

777
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
I planted a green one.

778
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,080
Then who put this flowerpot here?

779
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,840
I buried it here.

780
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
If he saw it wrong,

781
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,560
does that mean we were drugged?

782
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
So what I saw was a hallucination?

783
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,240
No, you just hallucinated and saw it wrong.

784
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,960
A hallucination that made you see red as green?

785
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,440
No.

786
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,400
You two are confusing everyone.

787
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
I know, I understand what he means.

788
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,080
He's actually questioning himself, I get it.

789
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,600
Alright.

790
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
Come on, your turn.

791
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,640
Check mine first, it's here.

792
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,560
Under the tire.

793
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
Then go get it yourself.

794
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,640
Why, just because you're wearing an evening gown

795
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,960
you don't want to squat down, is that it?

796
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,360
This one.

797
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,960
A heavy object.

798
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,720
My heavy object.

799
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
A shield.

800
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
The heavy object I used.

801
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,320
I don't dare dig anymore.

802
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I have a glove here.

803
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,440
So each of you

804
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,200
doesn't know whether

805
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
you are really the culprit.

806
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,560
Amazing.

807
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,800
Awesome.

808
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,360
I didn't put it here.

809
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,680
I forgot where I put it.

810
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,000
I can't remember where I put it.

811
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
I forgot where I put it.

812
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,480
No, but I saw something.

813
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
I'll dig it out for you first.

814
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,600
I'll dig yours out first.

815
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,600
Hurry, dig.

816
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Hurry, dig.

817
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,000
What is this?

818
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,560
It's a bottle.

819
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,760
This won't work, yours is rubber.

820
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm out, I'm cleared.

821
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,560
Hers definitely couldn't kill anyone either.

822
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
Hers is rubber.

823
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,320
But that's not right.

824
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,280
I'm sure I took something hard.

825
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,360
That's right.

826
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,800
This is already very hard for you.

827
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,720
Princess.

828
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,680
After all, your hands are so...

829
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,760
I'm the Princess and the Pea.

830
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,160
Right.

831
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,760
It's my turn.

832
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,000
Hurry up and dig.

833
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,160
It's here.

834
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Wait, it's out.

835
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
I used a heavy ornament.

836
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,280
Impossible.

837
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,840
No, it's not this.

838
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,440
You're cleared of suspicion.

839
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,840
Congratulations.

840
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,680
What?

841
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,800
This is his ornament.

842
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
This is the murder weapon I used.

843
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,040
This is yours.

844
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Yes.

845
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
A club.

846
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,760
It's over, bro.

847
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,400
The murder weapon is locked in.

848
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah.

849
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,280
Bro.

850
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,200
You could kill five people with this club.

851
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,120
No, I couldn't.

852
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,400
This fits your hand too well.

853
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
It's locked in.

854
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,960
No.

855
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,280
No more talking, it's locked in.

856
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,320
When you killed,

857
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,600
were you holding a stick this big?

858
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
He remembers it was a stick.

859
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,360
One you could hold in your hand.

860
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,280
Right.

861
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Actually, our murder weapon

862
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,360
is different from what we remember.

863
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,280
Logically speaking,

864
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,480
there's no difference.

865
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,280
This is a stick.

866
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
This is called a wooden stake.

867
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,240
It's a bit cold, let's talk inside.

868
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,600
Take your murder weapons with you.

869
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,080
Coming.

870
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
You're the considerate one.

871
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,240
Let's go.

872
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
You can take the doll back too.

873
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,000
Come on.

874
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,080
Just pull it, just pull this.

875
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,600
Wait, the head—

876
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,080
The head fell off.

877
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,040
I'll hold it.

878
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,680
I think there's still another problem.

879
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,960
We haven't solved it at all.

880
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Why is this red?

881
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,200
That thing on his clothes just now.

882
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Whose clothes are these?

883
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,880
Whose clothes?

884
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,840
Didn't that subordinate just give them to you?

885
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,280
And this one.

886
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,360
Thank you.

887
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,080
This is what he found in the river.

888
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,520
The clothes of the deceased that he found.

889
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,480
I'm Ren Weishan.

890
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
Tui Houlang sent me here.

891
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,800
They're the deceased's.

892
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,760
Yes.

893
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,480
Is it here?

894
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,920
Why does it look like oil?

895
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
No, this must be blood.

896
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Isn't this on me?

897
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Are we directly identifying the culprit?

898
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,280
No.

899
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,480
It's a key clue.

900
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,160
Deliberately saying this is blood.

901
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,960
This isn't blood.

902
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,440
What is this?

903
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,600
I knew you would say that.

904
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,640
Isn't this just blood?

905
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,120
This must be blood.

906
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,320
Isn't this on me?

907
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,240
Then what is it?

908
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,720
What is this?

909
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,200
It's one of my clues.

910
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,600
One of your clues.

911
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Look at this.

912
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
Inside here,

913
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,680
this is ketchup.

914
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,040
You used this to pour over him?

915
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,680
Yes.

916
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
I killed him with this ketchup.

917
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,440
This is ketchup.

918
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,920
Yes.

919
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
After about fifteen minutes,

920
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,280
I came back to kill him.

921
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,840
I saw him sitting there in the dark.

922
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,400
I picked up something hard.

923
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,840
It was solid, I thought it was really hard.

924
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,760
And I hit him with it.

925
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,160
I made sure he wasn't breathing anymore.

926
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Then I realized

927
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,680
why do I have ketchup on me?

928
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,360
I started to wonder

929
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,160
if I used that

930
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,080
glass ketchup bottle

931
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,000
to smash him to death.

932
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,160
But I couldn't leave with all this evidence on me.

933
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,600
So I took off his clothes

934
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,480
and put them on myself.

935
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,000
Ren Weishan's coat.

936
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,880
Then I walked out.

937
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Didn't I walk to that place with the courtyard?

938
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,960
Suddenly, there was lightning.

939
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,080
A big flash.

940
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,240
It lit me up.

941
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,480
Then I heard a strange sound.

942
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,960
I hurried downstairs and went to the riverside.

943
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
I threw the coat into the river.

944
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,000
Since you mentioned this,

945
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll tell you something too.

946
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,240
Go ahead.

947
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
When I came out, I was in the corridor.

948
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,080
I was about to hit him.

949
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,040
I also ran into lightning.

950
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,120
Then I turned around, and he was behind me.

951
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,200
So I hit him.

952
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,560
He was behind you?

953
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,120
Yes.

954
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,840
So what you just said—

955
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,760
Was it that I saw you?

956
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,280
After you hit him?

957
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,880
He died.

958
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,480
Because I used too much force.

959
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
He fell out the window.

960
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,640
He landed in the courtyard.

961
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,520
Did you confirm he was dead?

962
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,360
I confirmed he was dead.

963
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,320
He wasn't breathing.

964
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
You're next.

965
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,160
You saw Ren Weishan sitting at the door, right?

966
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,840
Sitting on a chair.

967
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Where were you when you saw Ren Weishan?

968
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
I saw Ren Weishan by the river.

969
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,920
Then I saw him from the second floor.

970
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,040
I climbed up.

971
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,480
Why did you climb up?

972
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,440
After the banquet hall event ended,

973
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,920
I wanted to come back and get him.

974
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,200
I thought he was still here.

975
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,360
When I came back, I found he was gone.

976
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I saw him fishing something out of the river.

977
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,920
Wearing his gray coat.

978
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,720
He was in the river.

979
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,520
Catching goldfish.

980
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,680
We were...

981
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,120
He Li was catching goldfish.

982
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,040
That's strange.

983
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,760
Alright, go on.

984
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,600
He was fishing something out of the river.

985
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,280
I picked up a stick from the shore.

986
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
A wooden stick about the size of my arm.

987
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,800
I jumped into the river and knocked him out with a smack.

988
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
I made sure he wasn't breathing.

989
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,120
He died in the river.

990
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,640
Then I climbed ashore and left.

991
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,960
Your forearm...

992
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,480
Your arms are pretty strong.

993
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,560
Do you work out regularly?

994
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,760
Are mine really that strong?

995
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,280
Both your arms together are this long.

996
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,320
A stick as thick as your forearm is enough.

997
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
Why are you arguing with me about this?

998
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,560
What about you?

999
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
I was in his room.

1000
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,160
I was there for five minutes.

1001
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,000
In his room.

1002
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,720
He was sitting on the sofa.

1003
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,520
Fifteen minutes passed.

1004
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,840
I killed him here.

1005
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,320
I was there for twenty minutes.

1006
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
I came out, I was in the hallway.

1007
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,320
At one o'clock.

1008
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,080
The small garden in front of the door.

1009
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,320
Sitting on the chair.

1010
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,480
I was there for forty minutes.

1011
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,280
He was fishing something out of the river.

1012
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,840
I jumped into the river and knocked him out with a smack.

1013
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
This is the current situation.

1014
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,230
If his time of death

1015
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,760
was between eleven and twelve o'clock,

1016
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,000
all of our timelines

1017
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,710
show that we acted after twelve.

1018
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,150
That means

1019
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,230
none of the five of us could have committed the crime.

1020
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,230
That's for sure.

1021
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,280
Yes.

1022
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
So now

1023
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
the murder methods each of us described

1024
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
are all fake and never happened.

1025
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,040
They were just our imagination.

1026
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,190
So which part is fake?

1027
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,040
None of them

1028
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,760
were the actual cause of his death.

1029
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,670
Right.

1030
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,040
So now

1031
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,760
the point we need to investigate is

1032
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,840
why the two of us saw him leave,

1033
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,040
while the three of you saw him stay.

1034
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,080
That's right.

1035
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,200
I think you should check

1036
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,000
the pocket of that doll

1037
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
to see if there's anything inside.

1038
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,040
Turn it over.

1039
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,560
Wait, there's something in the pocket.

1040
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,120
There's something in the pocket.

1041
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,520
I want to check it first.

1042
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,360
It's something unfavorable to me.

1043
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,840
I'll immediately

1044
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,280
eat it.

1045
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,960
I'll eat it right away.

1046
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,520
Boss Tui,

1047
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,760
the landscape figurine you ordered

1048
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,120
has been placed at your designated spot.

1049
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,040
It's set on the chair by the riverside at the mansion.

1050
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,080
It was placed there at midnight on March 15th.

1051
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,600
It was put there at midnight.

1052
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Okay, I scheduled it.

1053
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
I'm at one o'clock.

1054
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
You're at one o'clock.

1055
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,360
The small garden in front of the door.

1056
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,040
Sitting on the chair.

1057
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
I hit with a flowerpot.

1058
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,120
Then I struck him.

1059
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,840
You can't schedule this.

1060
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,160
My location is exactly the same.

1061
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,400
He was already killed between eleven and twelve.

1062
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
He killed this person.

1063
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,880
Then worked with us to set up this whole thing.

1064
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,600
All confused.

1065
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,200
So you definitely ruled me out.

1066
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,760
The time you hit him on that public bench

1067
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,240
was after twelve thirty, right?

1068
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,680
Yes.

1069
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,200
The time of death for this person

1070
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
was between eleven and eleven fifty-nine.

1071
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,320
We couldn't have killed him again.

1072
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
You can't prove now

1073
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,120
that you didn't attack this person during that time.

1074
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,840
Do you understand?

1075
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Yes.

1076
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,120
You scared me.

1077
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,200
Glowing person.

1078
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,760
This is on Shenhundian Island.

1079
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
The steward in charge of my district.

1080
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,560
Niu Da.

1081
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Look, Da Niu.

1082
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,640
Sorry.

1083
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
Excuse me.

1084
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,440
We're not bad people.

1085
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Someone is chasing us.

1086
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,600
Hide, quickly!

1087
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Thank you.

1088
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,680
Don't tell anyone we're here.

1089
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,360
What?

1090
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,440
Second Boss.

1091
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,760
Just now, did you...

1092
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,720
Did you see two glowing people?

1093
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,120
No.

1094
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Are you sure?

1095
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,760
Confirmed.

1096
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Where else haven't we searched?

1097
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,120
We've already checked everywhere we should.

1098
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,160
But their rooms

1099
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
haven't been searched yet.

1100
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,480
Then what are you waiting for? Go check.

1101
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay.

1102
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:36,960
Let's go.

1103
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,480
Retreat.

1104
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,440
Okay, they've left.

1105
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,320
You two can come out now.

1106
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,280
They're gone.

1107
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,480
They're gone.

1108
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,120
Thank you.

1109
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
Thank you both.

1110
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,280
No need to thank us. Speak.

1111
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,360
What are you two doing here?

1112
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,880
Now I think this place

1113
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
they might come back here soon.

1114
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,840
So let's not talk here.

1115
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,240
Alright?

1116
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,200
Let's go somewhere else.

1117
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,680
Come on, let's go.

1118
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,600
Let's go.

1119
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,080
We'll protect you, don't be afraid.

1120
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,920
Hide behind us.

1121
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Okay.

1122
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
Go ahead, speak.

1123
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Who are you?

1124
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,480
Isn't this your dad, Niu Da?

1125
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,720
Whose dad?

1126
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,440
Your dad.

1127
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,320
My dad?

1128
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Yes.

1129
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,240
Yes, child.

1130
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,120
Sorry you had to see me like this.

1131
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,680
Child,

1132
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,960
this is

1133
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,840
your tickets for the trip.

1134
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,040
All these years,

1135
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,400
I've used Tongcheng Travel

1136
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,080
to book plane tickets many times.

1137
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,120
Every time I open the WeChat service,

1138
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,880
I can quickly

1139
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,720
and accurately book hotels, plane tickets, and train tickets.

1140
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,720
The key is, the prices are especially good.

1141
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,760
Every trip is worry-free.

1142
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,280
All these years,

1143
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,600
you've all followed the same path as me.

1144
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Haven't you dreamed that we could set out together?

1145
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,200
Together with me,

1146
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,520
falling in love with every side of the world.

1147
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,640
All these years, we've always been

1148
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,520
following you.

1149
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,400
That's right.

1150
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
And you follow me too.

1151
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,120
We do it together.

1152
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,720
Are you Qiji?

1153
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,480
I am.

1154
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,000
Then I am

1155
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,760
Ning Reception. Do you recognize me?

1156
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,040
One day, I went out fishing.

1157
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,600
When I came back,

1158
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,840
I found that the mother and daughter

1159
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
had disappeared.

1160
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,080
For the rest of my life,

1161
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,000
I will be searching for my wife and my daughter.

1162
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,680
That's what I'll do.

1163
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,160
I know you.

1164
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
I'm so touched, I'm about to cry.

1165
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,560
Back when our daughter was very young,

1166
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,360
your parents

1167
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,000
took our daughter

1168
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,280
and abandoned her at the foundling tower.

1169
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,760
Yes.

1170
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,920
So ever since then,

1171
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,960
I thought we would never have anything to do with each other again.

1172
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,120
The Ning family, just because Nuannuan was a girl,

1173
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,080
your parents abandoned her at the foundling tower.

1174
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,480
I had no idea about this.

1175
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,360
My parents made that decision on their own.

1176
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,280
They abandoned her at that foundling tower.

1177
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,400
But it really wasn't me.

1178
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,120
She's your mother—I'm going to cry.

1179
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,480
I've been looking for you for nineteen years.

1180
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,960
I've searched so long my hair has turned white.

1181
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,880
Your hair turned white because of this?

1182
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,040
Of course.

1183
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,680
Isn't it because it looks good?

1184
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,320
If it didn't look good, you wouldn't have liked me back then.

1185
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,480
That's right.

1186
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,160
Back when we got married,

1187
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,760
you sang a song—do you remember?

1188
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,880
The most romantic thing I can think of

1189
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,200
is growing old with you.

1190
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,680
Yes, that's the one.

1191
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,920
I haven't forgotten you for these nineteen years.

1192
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,400
Really.

1193
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,480
Come, let me introduce you to Nuannuan.

1194
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,560
Here, this is your mother.

1195
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,000
Is she Nuannuan?

1196
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,800
That's right.

1197
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,720
You've grown so much.

1198
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,000
Look, she's even taller than you.

1199
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,800
No.

1200
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,560
On your back.

1201
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,920
On your left shoulder blade.

1202
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,840
You have a sunflower birthmark, right?

1203
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,200
Yes.

1204
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,520
That's right.

1205
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,760
You really are Nuannuan.

1206
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,120
Yes.

1207
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,640
You really are Nuannuan.

1208
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,040
Yes.

1209
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,600
I've been looking for you all this time.

1210
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,360
Back then,

1211
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,320
when we were abducted to that Shenhundian Island,

1212
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,880
you disappeared, and I...

1213
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,040
Come here.

1214
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,280
I've found you.

1215
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,560
Mom.

1216
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,200
Our family is reunited today.

1217
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,640
I'm so happy.

1218
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,040
You have another son.

1219
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,680
That's right.

1220
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,760
A son from a different father.

1221
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,120
Yes.

1222
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,920
You are one of the children I had

1223
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,120
when I was taken to Shenhundian Island and forced to bear children.

1224
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,320
You are one of those children.

1225
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,480
So all these years

1226
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,320
my parents

1227
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,440
have always stayed by my side

1228
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,280
Even though I'm not his biological father

1229
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,520
I'm even closer than a real father

1230
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,760
Yes, but

1231
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,000
I feel that in him

1232
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,160
I see a reflection of myself

1233
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,600
Where do you see your reflection?

1234
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,320
No

1235
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,080
This playful and beautiful young lady

1236
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,640
No

1237
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,520
This playful and beautiful young lady

1238
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
This playful and beautiful young lady

1239
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,840
Who are you?

1240
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,120
Here's what happened

1241
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,440
Around

1242
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,520
nine o'clock

1243
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,840
at night, around nine

1244
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,680
Qi Ji and I

1245
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,000
went to Ren Weishan's office

1246
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,800
Then we needed to fabricate some false information

1247
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
It was a fake death report for Qi Ji

1248
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,360
Then we tore it up

1249
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,080
and threw it in the trash bin

1250
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,240
That's the one I found, right?

1251
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,600
Yes

1252
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,040
Why did you do this?

1253
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,560
Faking a death report

1254
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,440
was to provoke your intent to kill

1255
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,000
to make you think I was dead

1256
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,480
and help us kill

1257
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
Ren Weishan

1258
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,400
Then, at 9:05,

1259
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,280
we were about to leave the office,

1260
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,480
but I noticed someone

1261
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,480
someone was coming over.

1262
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,960
So we didn't dare to leave.

1263
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,040
We couldn't get out.

1264
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,840
So we hid in the room.

1265
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,520
It was one of us.

1266
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,600
Anyway, it was a figure, and he looked quite handsome.

1267
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,480
It was a guy.

1268
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,680
How handsome was he?

1269
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm a bit face-blind, so I'm not sure.

1270
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,840
But I can tell by height.

1271
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,600
How tall are you?

1272
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,480
Not you.

1273
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,320
It doesn't seem to be you.

1274
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,880
9:05.

1275
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,480
Right, he went at 9:05.

1276
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,280
On my way back,

1277
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,840
I saw two people wearing cloaks

1278
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,480
the two with masks.

1279
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,640
It was him.

1280
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,680
About this short.

1281
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,040
That's rude, he's actually quite tall.

1282
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,600
Sorry.

1283
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,280
It's okay.

1284
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,200
He's about this tall.

1285
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,960
That's me.

1286
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,240
Yeah.

1287
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,080
Then it must have been him.

1288
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,120
By 9:08,

1289
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,560
we went to Ning's reception room again.

1290
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,080
I left a letter and a note.

1291
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,920
That letter was the farewell letter

1292
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,160
I never finished writing back then.

1293
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,800
Why don't you go in and see him?

1294
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,000
He misses you so much.

1295
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,200
The reason I didn't go to see you is because

1296
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,560
I've been holding onto that misunderstanding from back then.

1297
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,200
Resentment.

1298
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,320
That's why I don't want to see him again.

1299
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,800
I went in quietly.

1300
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,960
But I want to ask you something on behalf of my brother.

1301
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,640
Do you still love him,

1302
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,160
or have you, without realizing it,

1303
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,600
during these two years of following him,

1304
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,880
fallen for Niu Da?

1305
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,400
He just wants this one answer.

1306
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,440
So who do you really love in your heart?

1307
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,320
Tell me.

1308
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,680
The one I loved most was Ning Jiedai.

1309
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,400
And now?

1310
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,000
After the misunderstandings and conflicts were resolved,

1311
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,720
do you still love him?

1312
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,200
I want both of us to be safe.

1313
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,000
I want to use Ning Jiedai's help to eliminate the danger.

1314
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,720
I have a goal.

1315
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,920
No more talk of love.

1316
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,720
By the way, son,

1317
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,600
there's something important, very important, you need to know.

1318
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,160
I was in this

1319
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,600
boss's office

1320
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,800
when I found a USB drive.

1321
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,520
This might be useful to you.

1322
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,680
I have another clue.

1323
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,080
This clue

1324
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,640
I found it on Shenhundian Island

1325
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,680
where I discovered

1326
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,640
a stone tablet left by the descendants of the Qi family.

1327
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,440
Then I took

1328
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,880
an impression of the inscription

1329
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,760
from the tablet.

1330
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,760
I've heard my parents talk about our family history

1331
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,960
and it was related to a deserted island.

1332
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,480
So I thought this might be useful.

1333
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,160
Here, take it.

1334
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:58,680
Okay.

1335
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,480
Thank you.

1336
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,480
We still need to hide.

1337
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,440
We'll hide for now.

1338
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,240
Stay safe.

1339
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,880
Good luck to you.

1340
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,600
We're going to hide.

1341
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,720
You be careful too.

1342
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,600
Goodbye, daughter.

1343
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,440
You can do it.

1344
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,160
Take care.

1345
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,840
Goodbye.

1346
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,880
Let's go open that USB drive

1347
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,640
and see what's inside.

1348
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,240
Alright.

1349
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,240
This smart watch isn't the one he was wearing.

1350
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,560
The watch can record.

1351
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,360
This won't open.

1352
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,320
Wait a moment.

1353
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,800
The smart watch got water inside, the chip is damaged.

1354
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,840
Backup transfer error. Restore?

1355
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,680
Restore.

1356
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,240
Restore.

1357
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,400
It's coming.

1358
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,000
The audio file is damaged.

1359
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,240
The following is the restored portion.

1360
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,600
Voice-to-text information.

1361
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,040
Come.

1362
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,440
Eleven thirty.

1363
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,760
Speaker C.

1364
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,280
Outside, who moved the fan?

1365
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,760
It's so smoky.

1366
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,160
The food here is really good.

1367
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,600
The five of you seem to get along well.

1368
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
F is that boss.

1369
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,160
Boss.

1370
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,800
Right?

1371
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,480
F is the boss, yes.

1372
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Eleven forty.

1373
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,880
B said, "Have you finished seasoning your skewers?"

1374
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,680
A said, "Almost."

1375
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,920
How's your dough coming along?

1376
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Almost done kneading.

1377
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,320
Only the two of us have been working here the whole time.

1378
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,240
B said, "Done. I'm going to play for a bit too."

1379
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,280
D said, "I'll go watch them play cards first."

1380
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,760
Then I'll have a drink by myself for a while.

1381
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,200
B, what are you spraying at me?

1382
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,080
B, why did you hit him with the black rubber ball?

1383
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,720
Multiple voices at once, sound sources are mixed up.

1384
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,840
Then it's impossible to identify who's speaking.

1385
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,120
Isn't this a white marshmallow?

1386
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,800
It's clearly a peeled egg.

1387
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,560
I think Speaker B might be Bai.

1388
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
What do you use to determine who this is?

1389
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,480
The way they speak.

1390
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,760
Because "okay, okay, okay" is obvious.

1391
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1392
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Okay, okay, okay.

1393
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,520
B is definitely me.

1394
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,720
Wait a second, I just got a message.

1395
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,800
There's a message here saying

1396
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,640
Boss Ren,

1397
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
the deputy only gave me two fewer bottles of medicine.

1398
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,280
He said these two medicines

1399
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,440
were always kept by you personally.

1400
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,680
He only took them from your room last night.

1401
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,600
Are you guys reliable or not?

1402
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,760
Someone stole the medicine from there.

1403
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,960
This is a box.

1404
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,000
Medicine.

1405
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,880
This medicine is called "Disruptor."

1406
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,040
And "Amplifier."

1407
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,560
Let's first see what "Disruptor" is.

1408
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,920
The main ingredient comes from

1409
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,520
a special fungus from Dizzy Island.

1410
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,120
It can disrupt the brain's nerves.

1411
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,720
It causes sensory confusion in the body.

1412
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,480
It randomly causes the following two types of agnosia.

1413
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,080
The effects last for two hours.

1414
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,640
3D agnosia.

1415
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,320
You will see flat images as three-dimensional people.

1416
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,280
Clothing agnosia.

1417
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,920
You can't recognize specific people.

1418
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,760
You will mistake clothing for the person wearing it.

1419
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,880
Object size agnosia.

1420
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Object color agnosia.

1421
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,720
Object texture agnosia.

1422
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
A red mark will appear after inhalation.

1423
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,920
It disappears after twenty-four hours.

1424
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,840
There will be a mark on the back of the neck.

1425
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,520
Yes.

1426
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,040
Yes, you have a red one.

1427
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,960
It looks like a mushroom.

1428
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,320
Everyone has it.

1429
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,240
This is the murder weapon I used.

1430
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,360
This is yours.

1431
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:16,960
Yes.

1432
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,080
As I remember,

1433
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,160
there was green grass planted in that flowerpot.

1434
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,280
But now it's a red plant.

1435
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,160
A heavy object, my heavy object.

1436
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
I confirmed I was holding something hard.

1437
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,200
I think I am

1438
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,400
suffering from size agnosia.

1439
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
Plus, flat objects appear three-dimensional.

1440
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,360
He was sitting on the sofa.

1441
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,080
I hit him with something.

1442
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,720
Then I dragged him into the wardrobe and locked it.

1443
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,840
There's one of these here.

1444
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,200
Because I used too much force,

1445
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,360
he fell out the window.

1446
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,560
He fell into the courtyard.

1447
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,320
I might have soft-hard agnosia.

1448
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,800
Plus, flat objects appear three-dimensional.

1449
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,160
If the dose is increased, twenty minutes after inhalation

1450
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,320
you will lose the ten minutes of memory before inhalation

1451
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,120
and the twenty minutes of memory after inhalation.

1452
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,640
Used by burning.

1453
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,520
Burning it leaves a pink residue.

1454
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,520
Barbecue stall.

1455
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,920
Let's go check the barbecue stall

1456
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,680
to see if there's anything there.

1457
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,160
There's a pink one.

1458
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,680
It's this one, right?

1459
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,800
Yes.

1460
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,320
Through this fan.

1461
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,720
It was blown into the room by the fan.

1462
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,000
Right.

1463
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,800
It's a pink one.

1464
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,200
Yes.

1465
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,960
Okay, now we know.

1466
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,400
Come on.

1467
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,080
Whoever was grilling on the balcony.

1468
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,800
Got it, that's how it is.

1469
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,840
What time was the previous one?

1470
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,240
The first time, it was really choking.

1471
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,560
Eleven thirty.

1472
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,640
After inhaling for twenty minutes,

1473
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,680
you'll lose the ten minutes of memory before inhaling

1474
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,360
and the twenty minutes of memory after inhaling.

1475
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,800
Thirty minutes.

1476
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,160
At 23:50, this time.

1477
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,760
Yes.

1478
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,560
That's when you lost your memory, understand?

1479
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,440
It's this one.

1480
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,400
When it arrived, it was full.

1481
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,200
Each mark on this scale is half an hour.

1482
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,400
The first photo shows it at full.

1483
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,760
So it started at ten thirty.

1484
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,240
After you all left,

1485
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,120
it was about twelve o'clock.

1486
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,520
All the circuit breaker switches inside

1487
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,160
were turned off by me.

1488
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,320
We suddenly

1489
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,200
lost half an hour in the middle.

1490
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,240
Then at 11:20

1491
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,000
that was exactly when we

1492
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,480
started to have disagreements.

1493
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,680
Right.

1494
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,000
So the logic is actually

1495
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,680
that at 11:30,

1496
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,000
he lit this and made it bigger.

1497
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The first person was C.

1498
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,280
Who moved the fan? It's so smoky.

1499
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,240
So C can be ruled out.

1500
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,600
But we don't know who C is.

1501
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,200
Then B said,

1502
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,480
What are you spraying at me?

1503
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,080
Why did you hit him with a black ball?

1504
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,560
Wasn't it a white marshmallow?

1505
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,960
It was clearly a peeled egg.

1506
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,680
He said it was a black ball.

1507
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,320
He said it was a white marshmallow.

1508
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,320
That's a difference in color perception.

1509
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,000
A peeled egg is just a size difference.

1510
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,280
The killer did it right in front of us.

1511
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,360
Killed him.

1512
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,080
Yes.

1513
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,560
I'm not the killer.

1514
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,200
You have color confusion.

1515
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,240
In my flowerpot before,

1516
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,600
I planted something green,

1517
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,440
but red grass grew.

1518
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,520
The little garden in front of the door,

1519
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,400
sitting on the chair,

1520
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,320
I hit with the flowerpot,

1521
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,360
and then struck him.

1522
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,720
B, why did you hit it with a black ball?

1523
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,600
It's just color confusion.

1524
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,840
So it's confirmed that you are B.

1525
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,400
I am B.

1526
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,800
Right?

1527
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,160
I am B.

1528
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,720
Right?

1529
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,760
B, why did you hit him with a black ball?

1530
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,880
Wasn't it a white marshmallow?

1531
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,680
It was clearly a peeled egg.

1532
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,320
Why did you hit him with a black ball?

1533
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,720
Are you confused about colors?

1534
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
The person who said "egg" is different from the others.

1535
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,120
Maybe they have trouble recognizing sizes.

1536
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,720
Then maybe this thing is big.

1537
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,640
The person who said "marshmallow"—

1538
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,360
Maybe they have trouble recognizing materials.

1539
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,160
So this thing should be hard.

1540
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,560
So it's a big, white, hard object.

1541
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,880
Big, white, and hard.

1542
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,000
Is it a plate?

1543
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,080
This egg tart is delicious.

1544
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,840
How's your dough coming along?

1545
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,880
Big, white, and hard.

1546
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Dough.

1547
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,760
Can dough kill someone if you hit them with it?

1548
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,400
Burnt dough.

1549
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,400
That might be possible.

1550
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,320
Why?

1551
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,240
Have you ever eaten baked bread slices?

1552
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,360
Baked bread slices? No.

1553
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,760
Dough that's been baked dry is very hard.

1554
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,560
But it's not to the point where—

1555
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,760
It's hard enough to kill someone, right?

1556
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,560
Wait a moment.

1557
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,880
Here's the situation.

1558
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,760
This container can store low-temperature liquid nitrogen.

1559
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Liquid nitrogen can freeze things rapidly.

1560
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,000
For example,

1561
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,600
if this were dough,

1562
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,920
frozen dough would also become hard.

1563
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,280
Yes, after freezing the dough quickly,

1564
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,000
it turns into a big iron-like ball.

1565
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,920
A big ice ball.

1566
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,960
I think there's a big problem with A.

1567
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,880
Because A was grilling skewers.

1568
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,680
He was barbecuing outside.

1569
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,480
He covered his nose himself.

1570
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,640
We couldn't see it.

1571
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,680
Also, being outside had an advantage for him.

1572
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,920
He could avoid inhaling the smoke.

1573
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,120
Then A came in and asked,

1574
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,880
He said, "How's your dough coming along?"

1575
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,560
Only he cared about the dough.

1576
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,480
I understand.

1577
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,800
Right.

1578
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,200
That's correct.

1579
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,800
So A is the culprit.

1580
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,280
I think it's possible he's the culprit.

1581
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,440
Even now,

1582
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,240
he might not even know he's the culprit.

1583
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,880
I want to make a point.

1584
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,280
And what's the other point?

1585
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,160
This killer

1586
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,560
must have been able to get these two medicines.

1587
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,160
Yes, that's the most important thing.

1588
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,960
No, first he should know

1589
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,240
about these two products.

1590
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,000
In 2025,

1591
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,560
they were produced on March 1st.

1592
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,640
He needs to know this clue.

1593
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,240
He can only proceed after getting these two medicines.

1594
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,240
No, these two medicines belong to Ren Weishan.

1595
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,920
Who said that?

1596
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,840
Where did you find that information?

1597
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Ren Weishan's phone.

1598
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,560
That's right, but think about the premise.

1599
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,080
This is information sent later.

1600
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,760
The premise is

1601
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,480
when he wanted to kill Ren Weishan,

1602
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:28,840
this thing

1603
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,920
he already knew it existed.

1604
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,840
Give me the phone.

1605
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,280
See? He wrote it.

1606
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,840
The deputy gave me two bottles less of the medicine.

1607
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,080
These two medicines

1608
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,400
were always kept by you before.

1609
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
When they were taken from your room last night,

1610
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,960
they were missing.

1611
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,320
Yes, he discovered it last night.

1612
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,040
Someone from Ren Weishan's room

1613
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,960
took these two medicines from his bedroom.

1614
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,320
Yes, he saw it at the scene.

1615
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,800
Then he came up with this plan.

1616
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,080
Really?

1617
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:57,720
Yes.

1618
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,440
I know what the key evidence is.

1619
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,800
It must be on one of our clothes.

1620
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,480
The one with flour on it.

1621
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,080
But we all changed our clothes.

1622
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,880
All changed.

1623
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,160
Wait a second.

1624
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,320
Wait, we can rule out one more.

1625
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,920
This happened at the same time.

1626
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,280
Didn't someone say it wasn't white cotton candy?

1627
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,840
So they can't tell the material apart.

1628
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,880
Then people who can't tell the material can be ruled out.

1629
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,520
Right?

1630
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,880
That's right.

1631
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,320
Who can't tell the material?

1632
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,200
Me.

1633
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
I can't tell the material.

1634
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,000
He can't tell the material either.

1635
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,680
I can't tell the material either.

1636
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,000
He can't tell the material either.

1637
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,920
What is an egg without its shell?

1638
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,560
The size.

1639
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,440
Who can't tell the size?

1640
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:30,840
Me.

1641
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
My arm.

1642
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,880
He can't tell the size either.

1643
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,320
Right.

1644
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,800
Okay.

1645
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,480
Classic either-or choice.

1646
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,480
If the two of us can't tell the sizes apart,

1647
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,920
we can't be ruled out.

1648
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,120
Then why, when you two can't tell the materials apart,

1649
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,680
are you ruled out?

1650
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,720
Because I spoke up.

1651
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,320
I said,

1652
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:46,600
why

1653
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,400
isn't it white cotton candy?

1654
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,000
Right.

1655
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,560
So?

1656
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,840
You can rule out the person

1657
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
who said that as not being the culprit.

1658
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,880
But you can't be sure

1659
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,520
that you were the one who said it.

1660
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,120
Why do you

1661
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,680
think you were the one who said it?

1662
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,440
You also can't tell the materials apart.

1663
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,240
So many people can't tell the materials apart.

1664
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:09,680
No.

1665
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,800
I think this isn't the key point right now.

1666
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,560
It's about those two packets of medicine.

1667
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,160
Who went into the room and got the medicine?

1668
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,960
That's something the culprit would do.

1669
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,880
It must have been done by the culprit.

1670
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,160
Who has been to his room?

1671
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,760
Right.

1672
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,360
Didn't you all go there?

1673
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,360
Yes.

1674
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,640
Then we can't rule anyone out.

1675
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,000
Let's look for clues first.

1676
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,240
Come on, let's check around the banquet hall.

1677
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:29,920
Let's search.

1678
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,080
We need to check the trash can.

1679
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,680
The trash can.

1680
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,480
Hurry.

1681
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:48,960
Wait a second.

1682
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,600
What's this?

1683
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,800
What is it?

1684
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,720
Special healing ointment.

1685
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,480
I just searched the trash can.

1686
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,840
There was clearly nothing in it.

1687
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,920
This was inside the trash can.

1688
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,440
It's specifically for treating frostbite.

1689
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,280
Apply it and you'll heal in three minutes.

1690
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,600
It leaves no scars.

1691
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,520
He was working with the dough and got frostbite on his hand.

1692
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,880
So this means that

1693
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,120
if the culprit used this ointment,

1694
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,280
he would know he's the culprit.

1695
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,360
If he hasn't used this ointment,

1696
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,560
he wouldn't know he's the culprit.

1697
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,000
Do you understand?

1698
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,520
Yes.

1699
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,840
Because he knows he got frostbite on his hand.

1700
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,560
Right.

1701
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,800
He needs to use this ointment.

1702
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,240
Right.

1703
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,040
23:47 is the time of the crime.

1704
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:32,800
Isn't that right?

1705
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,920
Why is it 23:47?

1706
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,160
Because...

1707
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,600
Why did you hit him with the black rubber ball?

1708
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,680
It was clearly a peeled egg.

1709
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,480
It was all said by 23:47.

1710
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,360
So

1711
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,720
the hand moved at 23:47

1712
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,440
Okay

1713
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,520
23:50

1714
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,440
This time

1715
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,960
is when you lost your memory

1716
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,760
So this culprit

1717
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,880
was smashing at 23:47

1718
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,960
After smashing, they held the ice

1719
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,520
Their hand was covered in frostbite

1720
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,880
I need to apply this ointment

1721
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,280
Exactly three minutes later

1722
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,960
which is 23:50

1723
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,280
when everyone regained their memory

1724
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,320
you saw my hand was perfectly fine

1725
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,440
Right

1726
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,480
No

1727
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,480
No

1728
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,760
I don't think he applied it at the scene

1729
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,680
He insisted it was applied at the scene

1730
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,280
Applied at the scene

1731
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,120
Otherwise, his injured hand

1732
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,920
would have been seen by us

1733
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Who is it

1734
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,520
Hurry up

1735
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,520
Just say it

1736
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,680
Whose message to you was the most suspicious

1737
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,920
All five of you sent messages

1738
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,800
Here's the situation.

1739
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,480
According to the reasoning of the first six people,

1740
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,680
the conclusion we reached is

1741
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,880
the culprit didn't inhale the poison.

1742
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,160
Isn't that right?

1743
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,000
I think there's a big problem with A.

1744
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,560
Because A was grilling skewers.

1745
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,360
He was barbecuing outside.

1746
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,240
He covered his nose himself.

1747
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,360
We couldn't see it.

1748
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,360
Also, being outside had an advantage for him.

1749
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,520
He could

1750
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,760
avoid inhaling the smoke.

1751
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,520
The culprit didn't inhale the poison.

1752
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,200
Isn't that right?

1753
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,840
So the culprit didn't lose their memory.

1754
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,400
Yes.

1755
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,680
The part of our statements that differs

1756
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,720
among the three of us

1757
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,320
is that after the victim died

1758
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,280
we still saw the victim here.

1759
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,680
At 10:30, we were having dinner together.

1760
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,720
Twenty minutes later,

1761
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,200
the boss arrived.

1762
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,520
After thirty minutes,

1763
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,560
she said she was going home.

1764
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,440
She went home.

1765
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,440
We continued eating for another forty minutes.

1766
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,960
Then we left, and the remaining people left too.

1767
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,760
But when we looked back,

1768
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,120
the boss was still there.

1769
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,520
My account is exactly the same as his.

1770
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,000
Mine is also exactly the same as his.

1771
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,400
I saw Ren's clothes.

1772
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,040
I mistook the clothes for Ren Weishan.

1773
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,160
That's why I came back to kill him.

1774
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,040
Later, in the dark, I left wearing the clothes.

1775
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,320
I couldn't see the clothes clearly.

1776
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,520
And I didn't mistake them again.

1777
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,160
When there was lightning,

1778
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,240
I probably couldn't see the clothes I was wearing either.

1779
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,240
Not until I reached the riverside

1780
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,680
did I hurriedly throw the clothes away.

1781
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,840
After that, these clothes

1782
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,800
were mistaken by Ke for Ren Weishan again.

1783
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,240
He saw someone fishing something out of the river.

1784
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,760
Wearing his gray overcoat.

1785
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,600
Then I went down

1786
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,000
and knocked him out at once.

1787
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,960
First, I had color agnosia.

1788
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,240
Then, I had clothing agnosia.

1789
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,480
So I mistook the mannequin on the bench by the river

1790
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,880
for Ren Weishan.

1791
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,120
That means

1792
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,320
we've been affected by that mannequin syndrome.

1793
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,760
It's also called clothing agnosia.

1794
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,480
It makes you mistake clothes for people.

1795
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,280
So after the boss died,

1796
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,480
this coat was left here,

1797
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,200
and we thought

1798
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,560
this guy was still sitting here.

1799
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,640
That means the three of us

1800
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,320
have the same condition.

1801
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,280
So the three of us

1802
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,120
definitely aren't the culprits.

1803
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,560
Because we've all been hallucinating.

1804
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,720
Right.

1805
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,680
So, if the two of you

1806
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,680
didn't see this thing,

1807
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,600
that means you two

1808
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,720
aren't affected by this symptom.

1809
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,760
I went for a late-night snack at 10:30.

1810
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,080
Twenty minutes later,

1811
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,760
the boss arrived.

1812
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,640
We ate for thirty minutes.

1813
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,760
Then you said you weren't feeling well.

1814
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:34,720
So you left.

1815
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,160
At 11:20,

1816
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,480
I turned around and looked,

1817
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,960
and Ren Weishan was gone.

1818
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,600
So after I left at 11:20,

1819
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,520
he disappeared too.

1820
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,520
Yes, that's right.

1821
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,200
The five of us ate for another forty minutes.

1822
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,680
Forty minutes.

1823
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,840
Then we all went back together.

1824
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,200
The two of us had exactly the same experience.

1825
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,480
You two don't have clothing agnosia.

1826
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,560
Why is it suspicious that you don't have this symptom?

1827
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,240
Because you saw

1828
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,920
that this person left here.

1829
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,880
That matches up with

1830
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,280
23:47.

1831
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:58,880
After he died,

1832
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,000
he was dragged away from here.

1833
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,560
What you matched up with was the time of the crime.

1834
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,040
So it must be either He or you.

1835
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,720
Heavy object

1836
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,560
My heavy object

1837
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,680
This is the murder weapon I used

1838
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,640
Why didn't the killer lose their memory?

1839
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
Because after he inhaled this poison

1840
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,000
he didn't know what he used to hit him

1841
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,560
But before I inhaled the poison

1842
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,360
I already knew I was going to use this to commit the crime

1843
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,400
So I would know where that thing is

1844
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,000
After he was hallucinating

1845
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,720
he also didn't know

1846
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,960
what kind of hallucination he was having

1847
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,440
Right

1848
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,640
I'm the killer

1849
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,520
Before I took the drug

1850
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,280
I knew I was going to use this dough today

1851
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,480
to smash him to death

1852
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,520
So I would know the dough is here

1853
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,800
You just need to knead the dough again

1854
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,040
Even if I inhaled the drug

1855
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,920
and saw it as a black ball

1856
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,680
I would know it's dough

1857
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,120
Just pick it up and hit him, that's all

1858
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,920
I think what he just said was right.

1859
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,640
Why would I need to do anything else afterward?

1860
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,640
Just like you all.

1861
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,120
Supposedly, I've already been hallucinated.

1862
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,960
Go again

1863
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,960
and fake kill him one more time?

1864
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,080
When we checked the backs of our necks,

1865
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,840
there was a small mushroom mark on each of us.

1866
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,640
That proves we

1867
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,960
all inhaled the hallucinogen.

1868
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,000
A red mark appears after inhalation.

1869
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,720
It disappears after twenty-four hours.

1870
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,400
Yes.

1871
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,800
Everyone has it.

1872
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,680
It randomly causes one of two types of agnosia.

1873
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,720
Who do you think it is now?

1874
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,640
If I were to vote now,

1875
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,400
I could only vote for He.

1876
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,960
Anyway, it's either Ning or He.

1877
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,160
It's about the matter of turning off the lights.

1878
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
Since everyone has already

1879
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,360
completely gone back

1880
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
and passed out,

1881
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,920
why could Ning still come back to turn off the lights?

1882
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,160
It was probably around midnight.

1883
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,680
All the circuit breakers inside

1884
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,200
were turned off by me.

1885
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,040
This person just sent a message.

1886
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,040
We got a message.

1887
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,000
Mr. Ren, we still have

1888
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,840
two nautical miles left.

1889
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,520
We'll reach Yun Island soon.

1890
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,920
Is everything ready?

1891
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,920
Ready for what?

1892
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,600
Got it.

1893
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,680
What?

1894
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,480
Because his previous island went bankrupt, right?

1895
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,280
Shenhundian Island.

1896
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,040
So now he wants to build a new island.

1897
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,640
Yun Island.

1898
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,120
So Ren Weishan

1899
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,280
is still committing these bad deeds on Yun Island.

1900
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,360
So I think

1901
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,720
I have to go save those people.

1902
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,560
Because I am

1903
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,920
the proud and kind Ba Jiaoshan.

1904
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,040
That's right.

1905
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,240
After we finish voting,

1906
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,800
I'll randomly pick someone

1907
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,960
to join me in this good deed.

1908
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,240
Okay.

1909
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,880
We have to stop this from happening.

1910
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,400
No problem.

1911
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,600
Alright, no problem.

1912
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,360
No problem.

1913
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,120
Okay.

1914
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,640
Then let's go vote.

1915
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,840
The real culprit this time

1916
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,400
Motive: revenge

1917
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Used drugs to cause hallucinations

1918
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,080
Then personally used a heavy object

1919
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,960
to directly kill the boss

1920
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,960
My vote goes to

1921
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,120
my choice for today's culprit

1922
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,840
We deduce that he actually is

1923
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,560
not poisoned by this drug

1924
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,120
So the final choice for the culprit is

1925
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,680
I think among them

1926
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,480
he is actually the most suspicious

1927
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,760
I think the crime process is

1928
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,040
The murderer used drugs

1929
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,320
and killed in the banquet hall

1930
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,920
I think the real culprit is

1931
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,680
There are five suspects in this case

1932
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,280
In the end, the vote went to

1933
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,680
He Chongchong

1934
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,480
Let's go to Dizzy Island together to save people

1935
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,200
No problem

1936
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1937
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,720
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

1938
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,800
Next, let's move on to

1939
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,840
Tongcheng Travel

1940
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,480
the moment of truth

1941
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,320
In today's case

1942
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,920
there are five suspects

1943
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,400
They are Bai Zhihua

1944
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,360
Jin Shangbao

1945
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:11,800
Ning Jiedai

1946
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,440
He Chongchong

1947
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,720
and Ke Wuwang

1948
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,520
That's right

1949
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,760
Three players received votes

1950
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,760
They are

1951
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
Ning Jiedai

1952
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,040
He Chongchong

1953
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,040
and Ke Wuwang

1954
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,760
Why did someone vote for me?

1955
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,520
No way, man

1956
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,880
Who voted for me? I want to know

1957
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,840
If you're the killer

1958
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,520
I'll pin you right here

1959
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,880
The three of us will come at you right away

1960
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,160
It's definitely not me

1961
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,080
Still acting

1962
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,360
I'm still acting?

1963
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,720
You trust my acting that much?

1964
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,600
Among them

1965
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,400
The players who got one vote

1966
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,560
There are two

1967
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,720
Me and He, and who else

1968
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,680
Why is it you and He?

1969
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,320
It must be me and He

1970
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:08,960
No way

1971
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,000
It should be the two of us

1972
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,880
No, I just

1973
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,120
No, it can't be the two of us

1974
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,600
One player got four votes

1975
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,400
Ning

1976
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,120
I didn't get all the votes, did I?

1977
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,880
Stop laughing.

1978
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,840
The person who got four votes is

1979
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,520
is

1980
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,640
The one who got four votes is

1981
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,400
Ning Jie Dai

1982
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,160
He got four votes.

1983
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,600
Ning got four votes.

1984
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,320
So who did X vote for?

1985
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,360
X voted for Ning.

1986
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,240
X also voted for Ning.

1987
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,880
That means Ning isn't the culprit.

1988
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,600
It means the good guys lost today.

1989
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,480
Right.

1990
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,200
If there are four votes, there's definitely something fishy.

1991
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,560
No.

1992
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,120
It's possible.

1993
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,960
These good guys played really well.

1994
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
They managed to find me, the culprit.

1995
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,760
How do you know it's you?

1996
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,200
Impossible, because I didn't vote for you.

1997
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,760
I just know.

1998
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,270
The other four people voted for him.

1999
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,390
There's definitely something off.

2000
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,680
You didn't vote for me.

2001
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,560
The other four voted for me.

2002
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,240
I wouldn't vote for myself.

2003
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,390
So there must be something suspicious.

2004
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,390
Because the culprit and X are among them.

2005
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:20,800
I know I'm not the culprit.

2006
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,200
So the people who voted for you aren't clean.

2007
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,120
You're innocent.

2008
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,240
That's the truth.

2009
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,920
So?

2010
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,760
Aren't you going to cry now?

2011
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:29,120
I won't cry.

2012
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,680
I should be the one crying.

2013
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,520
Ning Jie Dai

2014
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,520
Is he the real culprit in this case?

2015
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,430
Is he the real culprit in this case?

2016
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,920
He

2017
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,840
is not.

2018
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,390
That scared me to death.

2019
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:06,520
Who voted for Ning?

2020
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,310
Among the three people left now,

2021
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,200
who voted for Ning?

2022
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:09,800
I did.

2023
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,350
No.

2024
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,310
No, if he were the culprit,

2025
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,960
then I would forgive him.

2026
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,240
If he isn't the culprit,

2027
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,430
you're my good brother.

2028
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,390
He is definitely not the culprit.

2029
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,310
He isn't. He definitely isn't.

2030
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,200
This game has failed.

2031
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
The real culprit is

2032
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:28,120
It must be you.

2033
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,390
Impossible.

2034
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,430
The real culprit is

2035
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,080
The real culprit is

2036
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,640
He Chongchong.

2037
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,720
Confirmed.

2038
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,160
I am X.

2039
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,640
So, who among you is the culprit?

2040
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,360
Because each of you contacted me.

2041
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,800
This container can store low-temperature liquid nitrogen.

2042
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,880
After rapidly freezing the dough,

2043
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,520
it turns into a big iron ball.

2044
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,640
A big ice ball.

2045
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,160
Special healing ointment.

2046
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,760
He handled that dough and his hand got frostbitten.

2047
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,040
He knew his hand was frostbitten.

2048
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,520
Right, he needed to use this medicine.

2049
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,000
Who is it?

2050
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,680
Whose message to you was the most suspicious?

2051
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,840
All five of you sent messages.

2052
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:36,960
This killer

2053
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,360
must have been able to get these two medicines.

2054
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,760
Yes, that's the most important thing.

2055
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,600
Someone from Ren Weishan's room

2056
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,520
took these two medicines from his bedroom.

2057
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,880
Yes, he saw it at the scene.

2058
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,360
Then he came up with this plan.

2059
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:50,640
Really?

2060
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,280
Yes.

2061
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,760
Then people who can't tell the materials apart can be ruled out.

2062
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,320
Right?

2063
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,600
You can rule out that one.

2064
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,600
The person who said that isn't the killer.

2065
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,920
But you can't be sure

2066
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,440
that...

2067
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,840
But the person who said that was you.

2068
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,880
Why did you

2069
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,440
Why are you the one who could say that?

2070
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,600
So many people can't tell the materials apart.

2071
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:08,480
No.

2072
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,600
I think our focus shouldn't be on this right now.

2073
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,160
It's on those two packets of medicine.

2074
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,960
Who went into the room and got the medicine?

2075
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,760
That's something the culprit would do.

2076
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,680
It must have been done by the culprit.

2077
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,960
Who has been to his room?

2078
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,560
Right.

2079
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,160
Didn't you all go there?

2080
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,160
Yeah.

2081
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,040
Then we can't rule anyone out.

2082
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,880
It's about the matter of turning off the lights.

2083
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,200
Since everyone has already

2084
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,520
completely gone back

2085
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,840
and everyone passed out,

2086
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,520
why was Ning Reception still able to come back and turn off the lights?

2087
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,240
I voted for Ning.

2088
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,800
Among these people, Ning

2089
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,840
actually has the most suspicion from everyone.

2090
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,480
It's the greatest.

2091
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,160
My choice for the real culprit today

2092
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,200
is Ning Reception.

2093
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,880
The motive is to avenge his wife.

2094
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,360
The real culprit this time

2095
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,200
is Ning.

2096
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,920
Motive: revenge.

2097
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
His motive is to

2098
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,560
avenge his father.

2099
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,320
I think the real culprit is

2100
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,560
He Chongchong.

2101
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,360
There are five suspects in this case.

2102
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,440
After thinking it over,

2103
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,680
I still can't really figure it out.

2104
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,040
So in the end, I voted for

2105
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:02,560
Ke.

2106
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,080
I hope

2107
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:06,960
to get a key this round.

2108
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,400
How about guessing for a key this round?

2109
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,440
You guessed right. You were the only one who got it right.

2110
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,040
Not bad.

2111
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:20,920
I'm speechless.

2112
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,680
Speechless.

2113
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,240
So the real culprit is He Chongchong.

2114
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,280
And X Ba Jiaoshan.

2115
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,280
The key evidence we missed was

2116
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,320
on the lizard tank in He Chongchong's room.

2117
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,400
There was frostbite ointment stuck on it.

2118
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,600
I think today's case was a bit difficult.

2119
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,160
It really was.

2120
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:41,960
There was a lot of information.

2121
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,480
Honestly, we deserved to lose today.

2122
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,600
Yeah, we should have lost.

2123
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,000
Almost winning would have been undeserved.

2124
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,080
Right, what's the deal with this box?

2125
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,080
Try to open it yourself.

2126
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,240
This box can't be opened.

2127
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,400
Still not telling us?

2128
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,440
This box is something we

2129
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,240
brought back from Shenhundian Island.

2130
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,600
It's an heirloom from our ancestors.

2131
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,680
It was from Niu Da and Qi Ji.

2132
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,000
She gave us this piece of paper.

2133
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,480
I found this clue on Shenhundian Island.

2134
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,840
I discovered a stone tablet.

2135
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,400
It's related to a deserted island.

2136
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,320
It mentioned Tui Sanniang.

2137
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,440
Since January 1st, 1825.

2138
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,520
182511.

2139
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,560
Let me try this.

2140
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,840
It's open!

2141
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,080
Finally.

2142
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:30,760
A treasure map.

2143
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,600
A treasure map.

2144
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,200
My grandparents.

2145
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,840
Thank you for leaving me this treasure.

2146
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,200
This should be from yesterday.

2147
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,160
We saw the full version of that.

2148
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,480
Yesterday, we took apart a lot.

2149
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,520
That one, piece by piece.

2150
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,840
That was one of the versions.

2151
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,040
This is our family’s totem.

2152
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,040
This is the totem, and this is the flag.

2153
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,360
The last words of Third Lady.

2154
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,680
I was once an abandoned daughter of a fishing family.

2155
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,480
Because I was alone, I suffered much bullying.

2156
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,280
I could only fish at sea to survive.

2157
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,560
The world is harsh and dangerous.

2158
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,720
Women suffer even more.

2159
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,480
Some are mistreated by their families.

2160
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,160
Some are sold for money.

2161
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,160
I could not bear it, nor accept it.

2162
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,440
I used the reputation of pirates.

2163
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,960
I deliberately spread secret techniques.

2164
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,200
Using the legendary Eternal Flow ship as a tool.

2165
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,000
Sailing through the winds and waves.

2166
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,080
Rescuing women who were sold or abused.

2167
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,720
Bringing them back to the island.

2168
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,840
Everyone said the island was full of treasures.

2169
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,240
So Ren Weishan mistakenly believed

2170
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,000
that the island truly had the art of rebirth.

2171
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,960
He wanted to use it to gain immortality.

2172
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,400
The first display.

2173
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,640
Guided by water.

2174
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,760
Signaled by sound.

2175
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,560
Three bell chimes.

2176
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,880
Set the ship on fire.

2177
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,480
He invaded us.

2178
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,480
He took all our islanders

2179
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,040
and captured and imprisoned them.

2180
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,840
The old, weak, sick, and disabled were thrown into the sea.

2181
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,320
The young were imprisoned.

2182
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,440
He destroyed this.

2183
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,600
The real treasures

2184
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,040
are actually these women.

2185
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,160
She used the pretense of sacrificial legends

2186
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,000
as a way to obtain treasures.

2187
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,120
Then she made many unfortunate people or women

2188
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,000
feel like they were being sacrificed to her.

2189
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,080
But in fact, she used this opportunity to save them.

2190
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,440
That was my ancestor.

2191
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,440
She was always helping women.

2192
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,400
This shows that San Niang is a true hero.

2193
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:49,960
Yes.

2194
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,360
There's some information here.

2195
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,120
Information.

2196
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,600
It's from a data collector at the Tuixian Group.

2197
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,960
He said, "Boss Ren,"

2198
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,720
that mysterious person

2199
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,480
after buying our list of wealthy clients,

2200
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,320
up until now,

2201
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
forty percent of the people on the list

2202
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,320
have stopped doing business with us.

2203
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,960
Didn't you suspect he was a competitor?

2204
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,720
We've investigated through all channels.

2205
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,080
But found nothing.

2206
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,000
We only found out

2207
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,960
that he had contact with someone named Ning Dengpao.

2208
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,440
They've been in touch.

2209
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,400
Ning Dengpao?

2210
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,840
Same surname as you.

2211
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,160
I see.

2212
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,640
There's a mysterious sponsor.

2213
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,920
A mysterious big brother.

2214
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,360
Forty hours have passed.

2215
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,720
I'm waiting for you in the courtyard downstairs.

2216
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,240
Courtyard downstairs, let's go.

2217
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,280
Let's check the courtyard.

2218
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,120
The courtyard.

2219
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,520
Such thick fog.

2220
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,280
It's foggy again, isn't it?

2221
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:50,720
Yes.

2222
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,360
It's foggy.

2223
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,360
Such familiar eyes.

2224
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,000
Forty hours have passed.

2225
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,040
Do you still remember who you are?

2226
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,720
Who am I?

2227
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,240
I am Liu Yuning.

2228
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,520
You are Liu Yuning.

2229
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,800
That's right, we remember now.

2230
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,800
Did you find any suspicious points this time?

2231
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,160
Are there any suspicious people?

2232
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,960
The suspicious person is the one who bought

2233
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,760
that forty percent client list.

2234
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,640
That person, right?

2235
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,240
Yes.

2236
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,920
His secret shareholder.

2237
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,720
He first funded Ning Dengpao.

2238
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,480
and set up a very evil experimental factory.

2239
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,040
Backend income

2240
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:47,720
Twenty thousand

2241
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,840
Backend income

2242
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,360
Fifty thousand

2243
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,480
Someone tipped us

2244
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,120
The money will accumulate here

2245
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,200
So what we guessed

2246
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,280
about being live-streamed is probably true

2247
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:57,720
Yes

2248
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,640
This is a live-streaming factory

2249
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,480
He first funded Ning Dengpao to start

2250
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,960
a very sinister online experiment factory

2251
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:05,520
Yes

2252
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,160
Then in this case

2253
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,200
he poached Ren Weishan

2254
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,880
forty percent of the clients

2255
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,400
That's right

2256
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,320
He's very rich

2257
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,560
So did you find the bomb this time?

2258
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:14,880
The bomb

2259
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,920
We need to find the bomb

2260
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,240
Hurry, look for it

2261
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,000
Quick, check if it's in that cabinet

2262
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,840
This one is locked

2263
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,280
Found it

2264
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,480
Hurry

2265
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:28,960
Hurry

2266
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,680
Take it away quickly

2267
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,880
Hurry

2268
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,000
Hurry

2269
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,240
Take it away quickly

2270
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,600
It's a candle

2271
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,680
I'm speechless

2272
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,520
Thank you, that was a candle

2273
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,280
Search carefully around the boat.

2274
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,400
Is there anything on this lower level?

2275
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,440
No.

2276
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,400
Let's circle around again.

2277
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,320
Check if there's anything under the boat.

2278
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,920
Like a bomb or something attached.

2279
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,440
I have to find it.

2280
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,840
Jin, search carefully, hurry!

2281
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,800
I checked inside here, nothing.

2282
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,000
See if there's anything behind here.

2283
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:04,600
In here.

2284
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:05,840
Wait a second.

2285
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:06,800
I see it.

2286
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,240
It's here.

2287
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,600
We found the bomb.

2288
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,040
Bro, hurry and disarm it.

2289
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,600
Don't let it go off.

2290
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,200
Three out of three.

2291
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,440
What does three out of three mean?

2292
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,240
Three out of three probably means...

2293
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,920
This is the third bomb.

2294
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,680
There are still two out of three left.

2295
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,320
There are still two out of three and one out of three.

2296
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,440
There are three in total.

2297
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,960
Ten-minute countdown has started.

2298
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,480
Wait, the countdown has started.

2299
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,640
Ten minutes.

2300
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,200
Right, hurry and search!

2301
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,720
No.

2302
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,640
Hurry!

2303
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,000
There are three here in total.

2304
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,480
Yes, hurry and search!

2305
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,960
Hurry, look for it, there's a light on it.

2306
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,200
Found it.

2307
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Two out of three.

2308
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,120
There's one more.

2309
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,760
We're still missing one, right?

2310
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,040
Okay, let me think.

2311
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,320
Where did you find the last one?

2312
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,440
Right under the sack.

2313
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,000
Then it's probably nearby.

2314
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,400
How many minutes left?

2315
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,080
Seven minutes left.

2316
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,480
I haven't found anything here.

2317
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,720
No way.

2318
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,120
Did you check this corner?

2319
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,320
I glanced over it.

2320
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,400
Hurry, six minutes left.

2321
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,400
Hurry!

2322
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,320
We've searched the whole boat, nothing at all.

2323
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,320
You've checked everywhere, and there's nothing, right?

2324
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,440
Come from the side.

2325
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:10,920
Like this.

2326
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,120
Let's check again, okay?

2327
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,440
Let's search around this boat.

2328
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:13,960
Okay.

2329
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,400
I'll search from this side to that side.

2330
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,240
Let's walk towards each other.

2331
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,320
Alright, I'll start from here.

2332
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,040
Okay, then I'll check on the boat.

2333
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,320
There's nothing on my side.

2334
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,160
Same here, nothing.

2335
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,160
Two minutes.

2336
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,320
We're doomed, we're going to be blown up.

2337
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,520
What should we do?

2338
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,320
It's okay.

2339
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,320
Ba and He will live well for us.

2340
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,960
Yeah, let them do it for us.

2341
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,960
As long as they survive, it's enough.

2342
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,240
Why are we still struggling with only two minutes left?

2343
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,560
Let's call our family.

2344
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,200
Let's record a farewell video for Ba and He.

2345
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,480
Let's record a goodbye video.

2346
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:40,800
Bai Yu.

2347
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,240
You should whistle that movie tune.

2348
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,200
Ten.

2349
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:11,920
Nine.

2350
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,240
Eight.

2351
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,080
Seven.

2352
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,800
Let's hurry and hug each other.

2353
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,280
Let's hug, everyone.

2354
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,320
Hug together.

2355
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,640
Today, there was an explosion at the Pirate Mansion.

2356
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,520
At the same time,

2357
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,640
a ship heading to Yun Island

2358
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,640
also exploded.

2359
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,400
The causes of both explosions

2360
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,280
are still unclear.

2361
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,680
Relevant authorities are continuing to investigate.

2362
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,320
Today's deceased is Ren Weishan.

2363
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,880
This person, in fact,

2364
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,120
used the guise of kindness

2365
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,560
to run these companies,

2366
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,560
but in reality,

2367
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,280
he was controlling a massive

2368
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,960
and extremely vicious illegal organization.

2369
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,000
It was extremely cruel,

2370
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,280
turning many young, innocent women

2371
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,600
into machines for childbirth.

2372
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,600
After examination, they had no prior medical history,

2373
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,160
no bad habits,

2374
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,680
excellent genes,

2375
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,680
and were able to give birth.

2376
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,360
They had already given birth for Ren Weishan.

2377
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,200
He even specifically created

2378
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,080
a system

2379
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,120
to evaluate the quality of their genes.

2380
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,880
This is extremely sick,

2381
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,520
perverse,

2382
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,720
and utterly vile.

2383
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,320
But why could such a massive operation

2384
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,800
continue for so long?

2385
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,480
Why did no one discover it for so many years?

2386
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,280
Actually, if during these twenty years

2387
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,640
more people who knew about it

2388
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,560
had come forward and spoken out,

2389
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,960
perhaps Ren Weishan's crimes

2390
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,560
could have been stopped much earlier.

2391
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,160
So here,

2392
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,680
I also hope that in your daily lives,

2393
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,800
if someone is being bullied,

2394
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,280
When you experience unfair treatment,

2395
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,720
you must first ensure your own safety

2396
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,280
and that your interests are not harmed.

2397
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,680
Then you can have the courage to stand up

2398
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:33,520
and speak out.

2399
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,280
The human experiments in the story

2400
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,160
actually violate human rights

2401
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,920
and trample on human dignity.

2402
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,800
We must never allow technological progress

2403
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,960
to override human rights.

2404
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,160
All experiments should be conducted

2405
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,560
within the boundaries of the law.

2406
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Do not drive the car outside the boundaries of the law.

2407
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,080
But in real life,

2408
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,280
there are always some people

2409
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,560
who create age anxiety for women.

2410
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,760
I hope all women

2411
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,800
when facing any

2412
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,280
situation that makes you uncomfortable,

2413
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,840
can bravely say no.

2414
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,520
Such tragedies

2415
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,080
are not only found in stories

2416
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,200
but even in real life,

2417
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:05,720
there are many

2418
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,760
cases similar to women

2419
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,040
and children suffering from persecution.

2420
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,160
May all women

2421
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,080
truly have

2422
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,480
control over their own bodies

2423
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,400
May every child

2424
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,200
grow up safely and happily under the sun

2425
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,880
I quite enjoy myself at every stage

2426
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,680
Maybe I was in a lot of pain at the time

2427
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,640
That period was extremely painful

2428
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,440
But

2429
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,480
when that time has passed

2430
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,360
and you look back

2431
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,000
you'll feel that

2432
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,960
it was nothing after all

2433
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:28,160
So if you face it with this mindset

2434
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,120
the pain you experience at each stage

2435
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,080
and during the tough times

2436
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,520
it might not feel so hard

2437
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,160
Seeing this kind of behavior from him

2438
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,680
the most likely crimes that could be constituted

2439
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,000
First, he would detain this person

2440
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,040
Detaining someone like this is called unlawful detention

2441
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,080
And during the process of unlawful detention

2442
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,640
if through negligence

2443
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,840
it leads to this person's

2444
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,760
serious injury or death

2445
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,800
then we consider it intentional

2446
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,960
This murder

2447
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,760
So when we see this behavior

2448
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,640
we impose a harsher punishment on it

2449
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,600
We have now set up many emergency

2450
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,880
assistance channels

2451
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,240
including hotlines for rights protection

2452
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,840
and some shelters

2453
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,200
We have provided for women and children

2454
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,600
these special channels

2455
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,040
So I think

2456
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,880
they first need to understand this

2457
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,480
kind of information

2458
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,080
and when they encounter such situations

2459
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,560
they should actively seek help

2460
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,400
If it happens in a public place

2461
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,760
they should bravely call for help loudly

2462
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,920
and protect themselves

2463
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,760
If we want to reduce

2464
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,480
the occurrence of these negative phenomena

2465
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,440
education is very important

2466
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,240
I think that

2467
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,280
we first need to change their mindset

2468
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,200
You don't have to think

2469
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,480
that you must have a boy in the family

2470
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,760
or that you must "carry on the family line"

2471
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,040
In this case

2472
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,840
if you no longer have this mindset

2473
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,000
many of these transactions won't happen anymore

2474
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,960
Tui Bai Ying Film and Television Company

2475
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,640
In the entire entertainment industry, just a single stomp

2476
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,960
is enough to shake the whole industry ecosystem.

2477
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,640
I sincerely invite all of you

2478
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,960
to join our Devil Training Camp.

2479
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,840
At twelve thirty

2480
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,840
let's meet on time, don't be late.

2481
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,560
Director, be careful.

2482
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,480
Whatever you do, don't die.

2483
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,280
Director, stay safe.

2484
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,040
Take care, Director.

2485
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,760
Why are they all telling me to be careful?

2486
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,360
Someone died.

2487
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,520
Tui Dao is dead.

2488
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,080
Tui Bai Yi Devil Training Camp

2489
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,880
Figure out the identities of these ghosts.

2490
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,640
The Chang ghost is me.

2491
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,640
What is a Painted Skin ghost?

2492
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,440
It's very famous.

2493
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:15,880
An insider.

2494
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,520
A deadly ghost.

2495
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,120
You got your friend killed.

2496
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,600
Little killer—who is the little killer?

2497
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,200
Tui Bai Yi

2498
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,240
We have dirt on all of them.

2499
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,640
Why is it called the Devil Training Camp?

2500
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,480
At the end of days

2501
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,840
They locked him up like a lunatic.

2502
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,360
Some believed it.

2503
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:26,960
Some cried.

2504
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,640
Some went mad.

2505
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,640
Utterly tragic.

2506
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,120
Is he wearing makeup or is he really hurt?

2507
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,880
Still acting even after the cameras stopped.

2508
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,320
Hurry, go!

2509
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,880
It's too noisy.

2510
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,200
Why do you say you're the Painted Skin Ghost?

2511
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,480
Because it's cool.

2512
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,840
Ours is very standard.

2513
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,240
I call him "brother."

2514
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,120
Is there really no pure friendship between men and women?

2515
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:07,640
Listen to Baba.

2516
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,200
I can't find your true feelings.

2517
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,800
This is indeed my fault.

2518
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,960
I'm the real culprit in this case.

2519
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,640
I slipped out of the banquet hall.

2520
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,040
I went to Ren Weishan's room.

2521
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,600
I took a bottle of "Tui Luanle" and a bottle of "Tui Dale."

2522
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,160
In the end, I threw away the used medicine.

2523
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,240
I also threw it into the river.

2524
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,880
After doing all this,

2525
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,000
I lost my memory along with everyone else.

2526
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,800
Is he really that willing?

2527
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,320
Absolutely.

2528
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,200
He's the brave one.

2529
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,720
This person is called Ke Wuwang.

2530
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,400
A perfect match for the profession.

2531
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,920
These small tasks are nothing.

2532
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,200
About face.

2533
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,720
This squid is delicious.

2534
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,000
Sorry.
