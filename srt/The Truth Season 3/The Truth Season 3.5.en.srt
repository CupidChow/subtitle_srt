1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,320
Someone is messing with me.

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
What is all this?

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,160
What does this number mean?

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,840
Did this 450 just increase?

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,920
Every time he gets pranked,

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
he gives a score.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,880
Five hundred and forty.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,960
Really.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,280
The boss has this kind of hobby, right?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,800
Only the boss can control the scoring.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
But the boss is dead now.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,720
It's possible.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,240
All of us sitting here right now

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,160
are being livestreamed.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,160
That's right.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
If you get pranked,
someone online will send a tip.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
After the tip, you get money.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,360
The boss is actually a streamer.

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
Thirty thousand credited backstage.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,080
Ninety thousand.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
Fifty thousand credited backstage.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
There are even hidden cameras like this.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
This one's mine.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,960
At the bedroom door.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,200
A hidden camera angle.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,960
Wait a second.
There's a cell.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Is this a tunnel?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
This is a prison.

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,760
Bring over Boss Tan's body.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,880
Use his fingerprint to unlock it.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,200
Right.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,360
Hand.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,400
Go upstairs.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,720
Let's go.

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,760
Thank you.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm out of here.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Wait a second.

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Open the door.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
It's so dark.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
How can you see anything like this?

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't walk too fast.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,920
Is this a tunnel?

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm a security guard.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Can you grab that piece of lint on my clothes?

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,200
It's just to let me know someone is behind me.

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,040
It seems like a factory.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
This is a prison.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
This is a prison.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,520
Prison.

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
It's not a prison.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,480
It's not a prison.

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
Live broadcast countdown.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,480
Broadcast studio.

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,520
Thirty seconds.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
This is the broadcast studio.

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
So scary.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,960
These are individual live streaming rooms.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
Please start streaming.

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,680
Please start streaming.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,920
Welcome

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
Welcome everyone to Xiaobei's

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
card-unboxing livestream

63
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Welcome to Sad Little Crab's livestream

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Welcome everyone to the Elite Livestream

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
This is a livestream factory.

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200
But they're a bit

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,160
bad.
They don't let them leave.

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
They force them to stream here.

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,440
There's no way to escape.

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,560
Welcome, dear fans.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,800
We meet again.

72
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Which celebrity's livestream do you want to hear about?

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Which celebrity's livestream?

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
Doesn't this sound familiar?

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,280
Do you want to hear about the nine-character actress?

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
The nine-character actress.

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,400
She's extremely well-known.
That's right.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,560
She and I are close friends.

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,200
Yes.

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,280
She has three new dramas coming out soon.

81
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,000
One is a crime investigation series.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,640
Another is a fantasy xianxia series.

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,880
There are already thirty thousand people in the livestream.

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,760
So, as the host,

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
I'm going to give everyone some benefits.

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
I'll just give you

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,280
the latest flight number of the nine-character actress.

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,840
I'll give it to you all.

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,080
That's actually illegal.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,400
I really can't believe it.

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
There's another perk, which is

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
the color category.
a two-character male actor.

93
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,880
I'll just give you his

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,520
parents' phone numbers.

95
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
It's all illegal.

96
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,120
Do you dare to name names?

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,200
No, she would be legally responsible.

98
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you know about the love security guard?

99
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
Love security guard.

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,520
Speaking of the love security guard,

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
actually, I have

102
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,440
another bit of gossip to share with you.

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,920
Really? I want to hear it.

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,480
Shut up.

105
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
Our two lovely female fans,

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
do you want to experience our

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
youthful and attractive muscles?

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
This is really cool.

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,079
Touch it.

110
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't dare to touch it.

111
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm really coming, but I'm really scared.

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,600
You can feel it.

113
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
You're really good at this.

114
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,320
You

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,920
He let me touch it.

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,720
What does this mean?

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
This one isn't here, this one.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
First resurrection returns.

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,640
Upgraded and now in limited live broadcast.

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
What's this?

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I don't understand.
I don't get it.

122
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,640
So beautiful.
Big Sweet Sis

123
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,400
Is this your sister?

124
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,080
My sister is already dead.

125
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,720
She already jumped off the building.

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
My sister is already dead.

127
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,200
Hasn't she already died?

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
What does that mean? I got goosebumps.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,200
What does that mean?

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
This is her sister.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
She's still alive.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,440
Is this Big Sweet Sister?

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,360
Sister.

134
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,520
Sister.

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,440
She can't hear you.

136
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,280
She probably can't talk to us.

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,120
No, she's already dead.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
But she's not dead, this is—

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,120
Right.

140
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,400
What's going on?

141
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,240
Changing disguise

142
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,480
You can even do that
Observe carefully

143
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
See if there are any clues on her

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,040
It's done.

145
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,640
So scary.

146
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
She didn't react at all.

147
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,400
She already

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,920
She's like this even when she's not streaming now.

149
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah.

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,680
Sister.

151
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,720
Those six people.

152
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,760
Come over and sit down.

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,360
Those six people.

154
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,480
Come over and sit down.

155
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Sister.

156
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:31,920
Those six people.

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,880
Come over and sit down.

158
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
Those six people

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
come over and sit down

160
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,600
Maybe over there, do we need to

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,200
have a clue

162
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,600
Let those six people come over and sit down

163
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,400
Those six people

164
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,240
come over and sit down

165
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,880
He said the six people over there should come over and sit down

166
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Welcome everyone to the Elite livestream room

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Welcome, IT Baby

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,640
Welcome, Revelation

169
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,960
Revelation, come over and sit down

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,280
Welcome, Pancake Sister

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,400
Pancake Sister

172
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
How bold

173
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,480
I've seen this before

174
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
I've seen this too

175
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,320
What does this mean

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,960
This kind of livestream room is really popular now

177
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,480
It's when someone sends gifts

178
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,440
He's the type who likes to be controlled

179
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
For example, if you send me gifts

180
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
For example, if Zhou Keyu sends me gifts and says

181
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Thank you, Brother Keyu

182
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
Sit down.

183
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
Your voice is pretty good.

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,040
It's that domineering CEO type, right?

185
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,640
It fits.

186
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,440
It fits.

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
This young lady in black,

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
come over and sit down.

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Sit down.

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,680
This beautiful young lady,

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,280
come, push me.

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,640
No.

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,520
You can go back.

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,800
You really enjoy this, don't you?

195
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
You need to really enjoy it.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Next, during this time,
a few fans

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,880
have come to our livestream studio.

198
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,760
Shall we have a little interaction with them?

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,040
Okay.

200
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Follow me and learn three moves.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
Whoever learns the best

202
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
will get a little reward from me.

203
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

204
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,600
Sit down.

205
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,799
Let's all study together.

206
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,240
Whoever learns the best will get a little reward.

207
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,960
Interact, come on, interact quickly.

208
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
Interact, come on.

209
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Come here, sit down.

210
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,720
Your fans can see you.

211
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,679
Come over.

212
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,200
Come here, sit down.

213
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,520
Sit down.

214
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,440
Alright, you did great.

215
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,160
Second move.

216
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,360
Come on, push me.

217
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,040
Push me.

218
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,160
Push me.

219
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,240
Let's all study together.

220
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960
Study together.

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,360
Push me.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,640
Come on, go wild.

223
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,560
Come on, go wild.

224
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Come on.

225
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,720
Go wild.

226
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
How bold.

227
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
Okay.

228
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,720
Pick the move that looks most like an elite.

229
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
The move that looks most like an elite.

230
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,080
Alright, this young man.

231
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,760
I can't do it.
Let's shake hands.

232
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,800
What?

233
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,400
Let's shake hands together.

234
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
He gave it to you.

235
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
What is it?

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
Why are you still...

237
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,360
...sneaking it in?

238
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,880
He wrote you a love letter.

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,480
We were all tricked into coming here to livestream.

240
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,000
You too?

241
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,280
You must have some questions about this place.

242
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,520
But if I help you directly,

243
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
I'll be taken away and beaten if I'm found out.

244
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
If you want more information,

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
try to interact with the other streamers.

246
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Got it.
Go interact.

247
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,520
Okay.

248
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,080
It's just that each one...

249
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,480
...has a chance to interact.

250
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
Heniba

251
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Dr. Zisuye, veteran Chinese medicine doctor

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,880
Welcome, everyone, to our

253
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,760
online medical consultation livestream

254
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,320
I have also been practicing medicine for many years

255
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,640
and have solved all kinds of difficult and complicated cases

256
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,040
countless times

257
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
Chinese medicine

258
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,080
I don't understand

259
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,240
Dr. He
Hurry up

260
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,720
This is your area of expertise

261
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,200
Just by looking, I can tell you're more experienced than me

262
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,680
Just a glance

263
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,440
Please wait a moment

264
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,040
A lot of fans have come to the scene

265
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Let me take a look at this lady

266
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,480
What's wrong?
I can

267
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,400
take your pulse for you

268
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,240
What's wrong, Grandpa?
You're not pregnant again, are you?

269
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,240
Can I take your pulse for you?

270
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Sure

271
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,040
But I already have a great Chinese medicine doctor

272
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,200
His surname is He

273
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,600
Come

274
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,000
Pregnancy pulse

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,280
It's a pregnancy pulse again

276
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,920
Again

277
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,640
Pregnancy pulse again

278
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Pregnant again

279
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
No way

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm still the reliable one

281
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,680
This handsome guy

282
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,000
His complexion

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,720
is a little yellowish

284
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
Yellowish

285
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
I want to check your pulse too

286
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,440
Okay

287
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Handsome guy

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,200
Pregnancy pulse

289
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
Dangerous

290
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,840
You're in poor health

291
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,360
Your body is in poor condition

292
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,160
Very weak

293
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
You can't just say that

294
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,080
I didn't

295
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,440
You are

296
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,200
The type that's overworked

297
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,120
And you often stay up late

298
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
That's how you are

299
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
Take care of your health

300
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay
Adjust and take care of yourself

301
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,760
No problem

302
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,440
Get your health back on track

303
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Young people, right?

304
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
Alright

305
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,040
Taking my pulse all the way to my bones

306
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
Look at the note

307
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
Poor Big Sweet Sister
My fans told me

308
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
The unscrupulous boss Tan Qian, to create a sensation

309
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
found a corpse outside

310
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,120
and faked her suicide

311
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,160
Actually, the real Big Sweet Sister was

312
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
So she is

313
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
My sister then became a streamer

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,640
She made a lot of money

315
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,560
Then she wanted to start her own factory

316
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,360
and made those custard mooncakes

317
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,160
Three years ago
Then I saw her

318
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,640
"Custard Mooncakes"
were selling really well

319
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
So I stocked up on a lot

320
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
But in the end

321
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
the "Custard Mooncakes" were found to be toxic

322
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,280
One year, I said that this Mid-Autumn Festival

323
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
my sister asked the welfare home for some money

324
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,640
and got a bit of budget
Bought mooncakes for you.

325
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,120
So a child died?

326
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
From eating those poisoned mooncakes.

327
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.
During Da Tian-jie's livestream,

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
the mooncakes that caused the incident back then

329
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
were made by this boss.

330
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Now I want to change the legal representative of the company

331
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
to my livestream sales partner.

332
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
If something goes wrong after receiving the goods, it's her responsibility.

333
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,960
So
she then

334
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,400
was sentenced to prison.

335
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,680
She was in prison for three years, then she was released.

336
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
But right at that time,

337
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,600
bad news came.

338
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
They said she jumped off a building.

339
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,840
Actually, the real Da Tian-jie

340
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
was kidnapped by Tan Qian and brought into this livestream room.

341
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,240
She became

342
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Tan Qian's tool for making huge profits,

343
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
A dress-up doll.

344
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
Your sister.

345
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,560
So she became mentally ill

346
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,640
because she was forced to.

347
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,040
She was forced.
She’s already become a puppet.

348
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,120
Everyone is being controlled.

349
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,520
Yeah.

350
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
That's right.

351
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,520
It's a Dilraba-inspired makeup look.

352
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Does everyone want to get perfect abs?

353
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,880
Then join Sad Little Crab

354
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,320
and get moving!

355
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Today is a special session for traditional-style dance.

356
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
Come on, let's show everyone

357
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,200
today's cards.

358
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,320
Today's game is a matching pairs challenge.

359
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,880
I know all the gossip.

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
Please get me out of here.

361
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
This place is a pit of misery.

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to be like the group next door

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,720
with their six streamers.

364
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,640
One day, after they entered the limited-access stream,

365
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,600
there was no news from them.

366
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,280
Six streamers.

367
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
So entering that limited-access stream

368
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
is basically disappearing.

369
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,200
Upgraded to limited live streaming.

370
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
If your popularity is high, you'll be taken away.

371
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,720
What does that mean?

372
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,120
Being popular here isn't necessarily a good thing.

373
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,280
Once you enter limited live streaming, there's no more news about you.

374
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,720
If your popularity is high, you'll be taken away.

375
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,680
So we have to make sure to

376
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,560
become really strong.

377
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,200
Only then can we move on to the next stage.

378
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,840
Okay.

379
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,800
Get ready.

380
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
You're making it sound like we

381
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
Is it really that exaggerated?

382
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,160
Yeah.

383
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,320
You're making us sound really impressive.

384
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,280
Like we're really impressive.

385
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,560
Here they come.

386
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
Here they come.

387
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,280
Please, live streaming system.

388
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,320
We need to learn from them.

389
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
We need to replicate what they do.
Okay.

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,440
Received a gift, awesome!

391
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
Hello everyone, I'm Heitu.

392
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,680
You take this one.

393
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,320
No, it has to be a guy.

394
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll take the first one.

395
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm going first, then.
Nice!

396
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,000
Next.

397
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,840
Alright, I'll do this one.

398
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
Then I'll go with him

399
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,400
This one is a bit simpler

400
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,360
This
You know how to do all of this

401
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,120
Usually

402
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
You practice in secret, right?

403
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Let me try this, okay

404
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,840
This is so hard

405
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
Okay

406
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
There are still three more people

407
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
This is for six people together

408
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,240
Isn't this just the Yangge step?

409
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
This is Yangge dancing

410
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,880
Is that the sound of a bayan accordion?

411
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,720
Is the rye bread out of the oven?

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Then it's all divided up

413
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,000
Alright
All done

414
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,120
He said

415
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,000
He said in the Black Soil era

416
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,320
Didn't everyone wear black and gold?

417
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Black and gold clothes

418
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Alright, there are clothes here

419
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Let's change our clothes

420
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,920
His
Yours

421
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,240
This one looks nice
Okay, I'll wear this one

422
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Dear fans
We'll be back in a moment

423
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
Be right back

424
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,400
Goodbye

425
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
We're going to change clothes

426
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,920
This looks great in photos

427
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,760
It actually looks pretty good

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah

429
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:13,920
Let's go.

430
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,839
Exit

431
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,160
Two, three, four, five, six, seven

432
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Go

433
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,280
Catch up to me.

434
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,200
Not you.

435
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,720
Weren't you charging straight ahead, bro?

436
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
It's already intense enough.

437
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,040
Come on.
Turn.

438
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,200
Nice.

439
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,520
The three of you, your legs—

440
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,360
I can't even keep up with the rhythm.

441
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,600
Okay
Let's begin

442
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm on the edge
Then I'll be here

443
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Hello, everyone

444
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
We are

445
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,080
Heitu Era

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,000
Thank you

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Hurry up and start dancing

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,680
I want to see, I want to see

449
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,880
Alright, then everyone show a little talent

450
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,240
No
Here's how it works.

451
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,200
We need to interact with the live chat.

452
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,480
Viewers send you gifts.

453
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,560
Depending on which gift they send,

454
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,360
they can choose which dance you perform.

455
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,000
For each of us,

456
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
as long as someone sends the corresponding gift,

457
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
we can go up and dance.

458
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,800
This is my dance.

459
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
Okay, no problem.
Alright, let's go.

460
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
Welcome to all the fans.

461
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,320
Baby.
Babies.

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,320
Come into our livestream.

463
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,960
Welcome, everyone.
And then,

464
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,440
If there's anything

465
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
you want to see, like each of us dancing,

466
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
you can also

467
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
send gifts and flood the chat.

468
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
Okay.

469
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,440
Here come the gifts.

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,520
Absolutely stunning
Love it

475
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Fans, you can start sending gifts

476
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,960
Who do you want to see dance?

477
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,280
Received the Bulldozer gift

478
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,520
Want to play cards?
Playing cards

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,320
Rocket, me.

Okay.

484
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,560
Legs are 2.8 meters long.

485
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
Professional.

486
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,720
Received a rocket gift.

487
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,440
Another rocket sent.

488
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,880
Keep dancing.

489
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,680
They just click on you because they like watching.

490
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
Click on you.

491
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,040
We need to boost our popularity.

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,120
Think about why no one is clicking on you.

493
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Received a gift.

494
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,640

Instantly became a fan

498
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,080
Has our popularity increased?

499
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,480
It has
It hasn't

500
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,640
It has

501
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,160

Let me show you what real professionalism is.

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm getting hyped.
Golden spoon.

507
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,720
So cute.

508
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,400
Thank you.

509
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,840
If we dance, we'll gain a hundred thousand followers.

510
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,000
Received a gift.
Awesome.

511
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,400
Here comes the awesome.

512
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,640
Finally, someone sent "awesome."

513
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,280
Finally, someone picked me.

514
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
You need to use the best music with it.

515
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Someone said I should treasure this part.

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,680
Okay.

517
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
He wants to make you a scandal for life.

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,240
Clap when you receive a gift.

519
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,400
Clap.

520
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,480
Let's dance together.

521
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,920
Clap.
Clap, come on.

522
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,720
Left foot first.

523
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,480
Then raise your hand.

524
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,040
Play the piano.

525
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,840
Make an X gesture.

526
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,120
Start with the right side.

527
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,880
Shake your hips.

528
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,160
Keep shaking your hips.

529
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,840
Clap when you receive a gift.

530
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,320
Streaming isn't easy.

531
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,600
Raise your hand, get ready.

532
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,680
Play the piano.

533
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Make an X gesture.

534
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,440
In a moment, start with the right side.

535
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
Right, left.
Shake your hips to the right.

536
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,320
Clap when you receive a gift.

537
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,640
(Live viewers) 3.7 million now, keep it up!

538
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
I'm really familiar with it now.

539
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,840
Playing the piano.

540
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
If I dance again, I really won't be able to forget it.

541
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm really getting more and more familiar with it.

542
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,120
Clap for receiving a gift.

543
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,720
Applause.

544
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,440
I admit it.
Um...

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,760
Is it okay if I say I was the one who "killed" Tan or whatever?

546
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,320
This is all I'll be thinking about when I go home today.

547
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,840
I've got my cardio for today.

548
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,680
Congratulations to this month's champion.

549
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,320
Monthly champion privileges upgraded.

550
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,720
Please move to the limited live stream.

551
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,520
We need to find the limited live stream room.

552
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:40,640
Let's go.
Then we can just go now.

553
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,200
Limited live stream room.
Let's go.

554
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,280
Yeah, we need to go to the limited live stream room.

555
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,520
Fine, let him live on his own.

556
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
He always puts on that handsome face

557
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
and does some really "silly" things.

558
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
The screen in front just changed.

559
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,080
Standard version.

560
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,840
What does that snowy screen mean?

561
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,720
Is that our screen?

562
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,360
Main screen control button.

563
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,160
Most popular interactive duo.

564
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,960
Jin Tangshao and Bai Huanzi.

565
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,240
I want to send some gifts

566
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,160
to Jin Tangshao and Bai Huanzi.

567
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,080
I'll protect my duo.

568
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,120
We're number one.

569
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Yeah, we already have a duo name.

570
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
"Brain Platinum."

571
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,840
We should really drink more of it.

572
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Really?

573
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,600
I don't know.
I just made it up on the spot.

574
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Made up on the spot.
Yeah.

575
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
Prime Suspect Betting Leaderboard.

576
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,120
What does that mean?

577
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
Prime Suspect Betting Leaderboard.

578
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,200
Wait a second.
Someone knows

579
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,800
about us.

580
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,040
Prime suspect betting.

581
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,720
So he saw a murder during the livestream?

582
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,120
No, the video was off at that time.

583
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,160
Maintenance at 8 a.m.

584
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,480
I forgot.

585
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,720
The viewers don't know who the killer is.

586
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,040
But they know someone died.

587
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,840
That's right.

588
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,000
They know the story.

589
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,200
Yes.
Exactly.

590
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,320
So we have to bet.
That's right.

591
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Who has the highest?
Green.

592
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,040
Golden spoon.

593
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,560
If you were the best,

594
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,360
I’d actually think there’s nothing wrong with you.

595
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,200
Why?

596
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
Why do you think there’s nothing wrong with her?

597
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,200
Do you think it's possible that I'm actually the culprit?

598
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,360
He's the one I chose as X.

599
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,440
Then I made him the culprit.

600
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,920
That's possible too.

601
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Limited editions, this way.

602
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,920
Limited editions, head this way.

603
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,280
Let's go.

604
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,320
When we were analyzing the rankings just now,

605
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
why didn't you say anything?

606
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
I was observing each of you.

607
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,040
It's open.
Come on, let's go.

608
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,640
Elevator, guys.

609
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,440
What does that mean?

610
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,280
It's an elevator, right?

611
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,120
This again.
Hold it steady.

612
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah, it moves.
It’s supposed to move.

613
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
Boss key not received.

614
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,600
This delivery cannot proceed along the original route.

615
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,400
Proceeding to the boss’s office now.

616
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
What does that mean?

617
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
Go to the boss’s office.

618
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
Currently moving

619
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,120
Arrived

620
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,280
It's open

621
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,480
I thought

622
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,680
There was a key

623
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Teleport pod start button

624
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
Teleport pod start button

625
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,840
If no destination is specified

626
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,760
the teleport pod will travel back and forth between

627
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,360
the office secret room and the second-floor streaming room

628
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,720
Normally, the boss specifies

629
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,600
where to send this person

630
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,080
For example, where to send them

631
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,520
But in the end
as long as he doesn't specify

632
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,600
they'll be sent to his room

633
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,560
So now that the boss is dead
no one is specifying anymore

634
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
Then let's find a way to specify

635
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
to send us to the limited streaming room

636
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,080
Right

637
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
We probably need to be in the boss's office

638
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,320
to find a
place to insert the key

639
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,800
and specify that we go to that limited streaming room

640
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,440
Should we take these?

641
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Here, everyone take one

642
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,920
Let's go

643
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,720
This is it.

644
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,400
This is a cabinet.

645
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
This is different.

646
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
The keyhole is different.

647
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Can you try if your small one fits in?

648
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,120
It opened.

649
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,320
Boss.

650
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,280
The boss's personal habit.

651
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,040
There's something here.
Wait a moment.

652
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,600
Come on, take it out. Take everything out.

653
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,920
This thing is called

654
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,840
an account simulator.

655
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
It has infiltrated all employees' phones.

656
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,360
It can mimic real friends to send messages.

657
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,520
It can respond to live chat requests at any time

658
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,880
to automatically send messages.

659
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,480
So those messages appear to be sent by them.

660
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Yes.

661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,360
Did you all
Many of you don't even know

662
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
that you sent these messages yourselves.

663
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,440
You don't know you said things like that.

664
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,120
Right?
I don't really remember.

665
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,320
Wow

666
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,520
Wait a second
There's one more

667
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,880
Plan for an underground dark web livestream

668
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
Set up a

669
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,920
food factory as a cover

670
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,120
pretending to produce Herlimu Jinyu candy

671
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,160
partner with an unlicensed factory

672
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,320
let the unlicensed factory handle production and shipping

673
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,880
run two different types of livestreams at the same time

674
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,240
regular livestream on the second floor

675
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,880
hidden livestream on the first floor

676
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,400
our workshop is actually a livestream studio

677
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,600
the hidden candy on the first floor is for the secret livestream

678
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,000
The hidden part is here

679
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
hire a group of "clueless" workers

680
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,640
"Clueless"

681
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,400
"Clueless"

682
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,400
"Clueless"

683
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Who are you talking about?

684
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,800
"Clueless" workers

685
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,920
Do a "clueless" gesture

686
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,320
Looks like you'd fit right in here

687
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,800
Yeah

688
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,680
create the illusion of a real factory for them

689
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,560
secretly install cameras

690
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,800
secretly film their lives as a reality show from all angles

691
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
based on how much viewers tip

692
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,440
prank them

693
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,400
Select a group of workers

694
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
Create the illusion for them that it's a real factory

695
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,360
Secretly install cameras

696
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,600
Secretly film their lives from all angles for a reality show

697
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,960
Based on the amount of tips from viewers

698
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,160
Play pranks on them

699
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,360
Twenty thousand comes in through the backend

700
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,400
Fifty thousand comes in through the backend

701
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,400
Different themes can be switched

702
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,120
The background becomes more interesting

703
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,800
The daily live stream earnings

704
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,120
Become our wages

705
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,160
Then we must be restricted

706
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,840
Activities on the first floor
We must not be allowed to find out

707
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,560
That this is a scam

708
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
But you have already found out

709
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
There is a very suspicious person outside

710
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,840
He is not an employee of our factory

711
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,960
But he is transporting our goods

712
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Actually, our factory is

713
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,840
Fake in operation

714
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
You found out

715
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,080
So after being caught by Tan Qian

716
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,320
He has to kill you to silence you

717
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,240
You did it to save your own life

718
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,560
So you killed him in self-defense

719
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Where did you get that idea?

720
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,960
I just thought of it.
Smart.

721
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm not an "ignorant" worker.

722
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,760
No, you're not.

723
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,240
What did I find out?

724
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,720
I didn't figure out the livestream rules.

725
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,640
Then what did you find out?

726
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,480
The candy-making process is fake.

727
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,960
Right, that's all.

728
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,480
He already wanted to kill you to silence you.

729
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,040
Because this is a huge profit chain.

730
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,120
A huge profit chain.

731
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,720
Stop pretending.

732
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,960
Stop pretending.

733
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,680
Stop pretending.

734
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,760
It's over.
You didn't really

735
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,080
You didn't properly refute her.

736
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,240
That one-on-one just now

737
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,920
was so weak.
You were weak.

738
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Seriously.
No.

739
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,560
His discovery really isn't that significant.

740
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,680
You don't need to defend him.

741
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,760
Look at you, immediately defending him.

742
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,440
Lao Bai

743
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,000
Lao Bai, you're being way too obvious.

744
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm just telling the truth.

745
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Really.

746
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
It's not that serious.

747
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,440
He wouldn't do something like that.

748
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,480
If he were X, he definitely wouldn't protect the culprit.

749
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
Yeah, that's right.

750
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,320
I wouldn't.

751
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,440
But let me tell you,

752
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
that defense just now

753
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,880
was really weak.
Because I'm quick-witted.

754
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,000
He said,

755
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,280
"You're very suspicious."

756
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,160
Stop pretending.

757
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,640
He sounded powerless.

758
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,920
Yeah, when you talk to her, you just—

759
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,560
"You're very suspicious."

760
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,680
You just seem really guilty.

761
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,640
And then you don't know what to say.
You get anxious.

762
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,600
But you try to stay calm.

763
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,160
That inner struggle is obvious.

764
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,320
First of all, whether or not you're the culprit,

765
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,520
you're definitely

766
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,640
the "ignorant" worker.

767
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
Let's wait a bit before blaming them.

768
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,880
What is this?

769
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,440
Livestream backend data.

770
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,000
It should be from six to eight o'clock today.

771
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,560
There's nothing because the internet was down.

772
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,640
Right.

773
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,200
Check the saved chat records.

774
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,320
Can we view this? Can we scroll through it?

775
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,160
The shutdown is finally over.

776
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm first, right? It's eight o'clock.

777
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,600
The stranger he mentioned

778
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,760
should be the one who ran out.

779
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,000
Three scary gifts.

780
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,160
The scary gifts are funny.

781
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,560
They're flashing their money to intimidate us.

782
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,040
I think

783
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,960
I'll give you a hundred bucks

784
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,960
There are still sounds coming from Six Star Street

785
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,640
It's my main song

786
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,280
What's going on? Did someone die?

787
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,800
So weak.

788
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,400
We’re all that voice actor’s...

789
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah.
Texture.

790
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,680
Let’s make it ceremonial.

791
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,720
As someone with rhinitis...

792
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
But this is key information.

793
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,480
Have you tried the code panel?

794
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,520
Scroll down further.
Scroll all the way to the bottom and take a look.

795
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
That's all there is.

796
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
Yours seems more suspicious.

797
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,080
What were you looking at by the serving window?

798
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,880
I was just looking at the boss's code.

799
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,440
You were looking at the boss's code at the serving window.

800
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,920
Ba Fentang was also trying the code at the conveyor belt.

801
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,520
We don't have that.
Yes.

802
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,080
So she might have figured out the code too.

803
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,800
Found that one and climbed back in reverse.

804
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,520
I've never gotten the code right.

805
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,680
Never.
That's what everyone says.

806
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,679
We still have to investigate

807
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,920
who actually has a motive for the crime

808
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
and the time the crime was committed

809
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,080
We already know all the motives.

810
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,480
We know the motives of all four of you.

811
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,000
But because of her jumping off the building,

812
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,280
I find it very suspicious.

813
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
Could it be that at that time,

814
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,679
when he pushed my sister down the stairs,

815
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,040
during the struggle,

816
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,360
he grabbed my sister's bracelet.

817
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,120
I grew up in the Tuitu Village orphanage.

818
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,440
There was a little kid

819
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,320
named Little Mantou.

820
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,040
He loved eating my steamed buns the most.

821
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,679
So I said,
this Mid-Autumn Festival,

822
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,760
I'll buy you all mooncakes.

823
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,960
So a child died,

824
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,040
after eating that poisoned mooncake.

825
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,840
That's right.

826
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,800
I discovered

827
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,720
that our factory was actually

828
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,760
faking its operations.

829
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,120
When Sister Datian was livestreaming,

830
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,520
the mooncake that caused the incident

831
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
was made by this boss.

832
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,240
So he owed money outside,

833
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,800
and then he discovered the company's secret.

834
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,560
He used the secret to threaten the boss.

835
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,120
It's true that I threatened the boss.

836
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,480
But I did it to save her.

837
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,720
Not for myself.

838
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,400
Since I was little, I've had

839
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,640
a dream of becoming a gaming master.

840
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,760
The club replied to me.

841
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,640
He wants to video call me.

842
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,960
So I secretly did it while I was on duty.

843
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,440
I brought my phone with me.

844
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,000
At that time, the boss

845
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
thought I was recording a video.

846
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,920
But actually, I was with my club

847
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,360
on a video call.

848
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
He had one condition,

849
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
if you want to play professionally at my club,

850
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,000
you as a player can't have

851
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,760
any personal legal disputes.

852
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,160
So you killed the boss.

853
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,080
Because you owed him a million.
That's right.

854
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
We can confirm that

855
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
the time of the crime

856
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,400
was between 6:30 and 8:00 a.m. on the 25th.

857
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes.

858
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,760
When the livestream was off.

859
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,800
So how did the killer commit the crime?

860
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,720
He must have done it when I went to deliver breakfast

861
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,280
when I wasn't in the cafeteria

862
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,360
He entered the cafeteria

863
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,520
walked to the work area via the conveyor belt

864
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,600
After hitting the boss with a hammer

865
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
he quickly returned to his own living area

866
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,800
No

867
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,600
That paper posted under the boss's second floor

868
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,440
The boss comes down every day

869
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,520
He always comes down himself to get breakfast

870
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,880
No one delivers food to him

871
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
I think the place where the boss was killed

872
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,880
was probably at the restaurant's conveyor belt

873
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,440
at the pickup area and the conveyor belt

874
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,760
After he killed the boss there

875
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,840
he put the body directly onto it

876
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,960
and then slid along with it to the other side

877
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
He didn't need to carry it

878
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,560
Then at this point

879
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,720
the body would move this way

880
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,040
while he walked outside

881
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,960
like this
and went straight over there

882
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,840
so he could meet up with the body

883
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,880
Impossible

884
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,040
Impossible

885
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,840
Why?

886
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,920
Because the access control would show it

887
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,760
But there was no access record

888
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,840
He can slide over together with the boss.

889
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,320
Right.

890
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
That works too.

891
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

892
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
I think what you said about the boss picking up the food

893
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,920
is a very important point.

894
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,160
Yeah, I was just thinking about that too.

895
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,240
The first time we went there,

896
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,440
we opened the serving hatch door,

897
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,000
but couldn't open the inner door.

898
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,520
That's right.

899
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,000
Is it open?

900
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,400
It can't be opened.

901
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,280
So he must have waited

902
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,720
until it was time to deliver breakfast.

903
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
The boss was there to receive breakfast.

904
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
When it was opened,

905
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,240
he had the chance to go in

906
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,080
and kill the boss.

907
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,720
Then what time the boss picks up the meal becomes important.

908
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,840
Right.

909
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't know about this.

910
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,680
Then let's do it this way.

911
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,080
He was there at seven o'clock.

912
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,600
He killed this person, right?

913
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,360
He died at seven, right?

914
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
The crime could only have happened

915
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,640
after 6:57.

916
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,880
Because before 6:57

917
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,840
I was in the cafeteria the whole time.

918
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,520
The time to commit the crime was only two to three minutes.

919
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,600
So when you left the kitchen

920
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,920
he knew the boss would probably

921
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,800
come around seven o'clock
to pick up the meal.

922
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,120
There wasn't enough time.

923
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,440
Not enough time.

924
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,800
That track

925
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,440
if you wanted to transport the body over

926
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,000
we all took this track to get there.

927
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
This is the meditation tunnel, it's called

928
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
I was sitting on the track

929
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,960
I wondered why it was taking so long.

930
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,360
Why is it taking so long?

931
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,480
I was probably on the track

932
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,520
for almost three minutes.

933
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,920
I said meditation, do you remember?

934
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,560
Yes.

935
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,720
We can time it for a few minutes.

936
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,320
No problem.

937
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,480
No problem.
Sure.

938
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,240
I'll go check right now.

939
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,160
Okay.

940
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Wait for me here.

941
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,280
Can you do it?

942
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
It's great to be young.

943
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,920
How many years apart are you?

944
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,200
What's the age difference between you?
That's quite a big difference.

945
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,600
It's a big difference.

946
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,960
I'll time you.

947
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,760
Ready.

948
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,040
Three, two, one, go.

949
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,360
Left

950
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,440
Two minutes and forty-five seconds

951
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,320
Alright then
Okay, got it, roughly

952
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Let's head back first

953
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,240
Let's go back, don't discuss it here

954
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,440
Come on

955
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,240
Let's go over the timeline first

956
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,800
At 6:55, I went to wash up

957
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
Came out after about three minutes

958
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Saw Heniba

959
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,880
6:57

960
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
I was delivering breakfast to everyone

961
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,600
At that time

962
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,520
It was the golden spoon

963
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,800
Bafen sugar

964
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,440
Heniba
Bahe

965
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Six fifty-eight.

966
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,640
At this time, it was Heniba and Ke'an watching, right?

967
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,720
You two were over here.

968
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,160
So your window for committing the act is

969
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,520
only two minutes.

970
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,480
We have three minutes.

971
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,240
The conveyor belt time

972
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,520
just for the trip there takes two minutes and forty-five seconds.

973
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,960
Right?
Right.

974
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
Two minutes and forty-five seconds.

975
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,800
So our two minutes

976
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
is basically impossible.

977
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,080
So actually, those two can be ruled out directly.

978
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,800
Yes.

979
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
So it's just me and Bafentang, right?

980
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,440
So it's one of the two of us.

981
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Then Bafentang...
Or me...

982
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,640
Then it's pretty clear, isn't it...

983
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,840
He can't do it in three minutes, right? That's what I want to ask.

984
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,840
Three minutes is just for the conveyor belt.

985
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,000
It takes that long just to transport.

986
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,080
And then you still have to set it up properly.

987
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,960
It's impossible.

988
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,000
Why?

989
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,120
It can't be done.

990
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,640
Because just getting across on our conveyor belt

991
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,120
already takes two minutes and forty-five seconds.

992
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,800
The last time I met Ba Fen Tang

993
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,920
was at the girls' dormitory.

994
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,440
We ran from the girls' dorm to the cafeteria.

995
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,880
Opened the transfer portal and went in.

996
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,800
Then went down.

997
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,760
There's absolutely not enough time for all that.

998
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,800
There's only three minutes.

999
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,880
It's just not enough.

1000
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,040
It seems like nobody has enough time.

1001
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
Everyone's time is tight.

1002
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,200
Yeah.

1003
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,880
If we can't make it by seven o'clock,

1004
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,800
if we can't reach that time,

1005
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,720
then how did he record the video?

1006
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,760
Selfie.

1007
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
No, come on, man.

1008
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,840
Why are you still making lame jokes?

1009
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,120
So how was the video filmed?

1010
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,320
It must have been faked, then.

1011
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,360
What is this?

1012
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,440
What is this thing?

1013
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,360
Look, this is hotpot, see?

1014
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,480
The dorm is a dungeon.

1015
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,480
After adding special effects.

1016
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,040
Yeah.

1017
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,080
Do you understand?
No.

1018
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,280
Do you know what these mean?

1019
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,840
The background in that video.

1020
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,280
It might have been edited out.

1021
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,360
He was wearing a green suit.

1022
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,960
He was wearing a green suit.

1023
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,360
The place where he died in the video.

1024
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,480
Is not where we found him.

1025
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,080
All his backgrounds were done with a green screen.

1026
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,280
They can be changed to anywhere.

1027
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,800
Just now, this electrical room was a cafeteria.

1028
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,240
Now it’s turned into, what is it...

1029
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,640
A crystal cellar or something.

1030
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,400
Yeah.

1031
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,960
This thing

1032
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,000
The most direct point is

1033
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,520
it can point to the video on the phone.

1034
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,040
Its background
can be faked.

1035
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,360
It can be faked.
Okay.

1036
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,040
The video's background can also be changed.

1037
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,920
Look.

1038
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,120
Take a close look at this video.

1039
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,920
The boss died very stubbornly.

1040
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,760
No.

1041
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,480
Look at this box here.

1042
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,440
It's skipping frames.

1043
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,840
There are signs of editing.

1044
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,400
Did you see that?
So this means the boss

1045
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,760
wasn't necessarily hit there.

1046
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,080
That's right.
He could have been

1047
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,840
hit somewhere else.
That's right.

1048
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,920
That means the crime path is incorrect.

1049
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,600
Right.

1050
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,280
I could have died where I picked up breakfast.

1051
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,120
Just died there.

1052
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,480
There would be plenty of time to move the body afterward.

1053
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,800
As long as the time of death is seven o'clock.

1054
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,080
Right.

1055
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,200
Anytime after seven.

1056
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,720
Right.
After filming the video.

1057
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
From seven to seven fifty-five.
During this period.

1058
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,080
We didn't see each other.

1059
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,720
There was plenty of time to move things.

1060
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
It wasn't until eight o'clock.

1061
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,240
The video wasn't started until eight.

1062
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,640
And then there was a long period of time.

1063
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,280
You'd need a green screen for that.

1064
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,360
Or the same space.

1065
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,400
Only then could you film that video.

1066
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,840
We have green screens everywhere.

1067
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,000
Outside the food pass-through.

1068
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,080
Aren't there a bunch of green boxes there?

1069
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,080
What do you mean?

1070
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,320
What do you mean, kill at the food pass-through?

1071
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,040
Let's go check the food pass-through.

1072
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,240
Let's go.

1073
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,480
Go take a look, let's go.

1074
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,320
No need to go.

1075
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,400
It's green outside.

1076
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,120
It's all green.

1077
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,600
But there are white parts on top.

1078
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,720
Just this.

1079
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,080
The same.
Same.

1080
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,400
It's this.

1081
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
The floors are all the same.

1082
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,360
No need to explain any further.

1083
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,600
Golden spoon.

1084
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,760
This is your perfect crime scene.

1085
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,120
Just pin the blame on me.

1086
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,320
Fifty-seven minutes.

1087
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,400
I'm delivering breakfast to everyone.

1088
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,200
I understand.

1089
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,960
I understand.
It's not her.

1090
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,280
No.
Listen to me.

1091
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,920
From 3:30 to 6:00.

1092
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,360
Fifty-seven.
Between 6:00 and 6:57.

1093
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,200
You were here making breakfast.
Yes.

1094
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,160
The three of us.

1095
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,960
It's impossible for us to commit the crime in front of you.

1096
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,680
Of course it's impossible.
Then at 6:57.

1097
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,320
After you finished delivering the meal, you went back.

1098
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,800
Yes.

1099
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,160
But there was a video recorded at 7:00.

1100
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,240
Although this video was recorded.

1101
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,200
But the time at 7:00 is correct.

1102
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,520
Yes.

1103
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,400
That person came after I left.

1104
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,280
Yes, after you left.

1105
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,160
And I have something important to emphasize.

1106
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,760
I must say it.

1107
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,040
Everyone's.

1108
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,240
Everyone knows.

1109
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
At 6:57,

1110
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,160
I always leave here to deliver breakfast.

1111
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,120
Yes, it's not important, because you—
What you emphasized.

1112
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,320
Yes.

1113
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,760
Emphasize.

1114
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,160
Impressive.

1115
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,480
Because you left at 6:57.

1116
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,680
There were only three minutes.

1117
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
To kill him and record the video.

1118
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,880
Just those two things.
That's right.

1119
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,920
No problem.
Then there's no problem.

1120
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,160
Because there's no rush to deliver it.

1121
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,720
Then do it later.

1122
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,240
Yes, do it later.

1123
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:19,640
Yes.

1124
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,760
What we know is that he fainted first.

1125
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,640
Then died.

1126
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
The boss was drugged and passed out.

1127
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,920
Did he have any symptoms?

1128
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,240
No, how did he faint?

1129
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,560
Right now, we don't know how he fainted.

1130
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,720
Could there be something we haven't found yet?

1131
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,000
Let's look for it together.

1132
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,880
Let's start searching from the main hall.
Let's go.

1133
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,920
Is there something there?

1134
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
Something that could make him pass out?

1135
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,360
He was just knocked out.
Or maybe it was that candy.

1136
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,320
Look around, see if there's anything.

1137
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,640
Do you see anything in this basket?

1138
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
We might really have to tear the place apart in the future.

1139
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,240
Alright, I'm going to start tearing the place apart.

1140
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,520
Is it inside these barrels?

1141
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,720
Have you checked all of them?
Some of the barrels are empty.

1142
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,840
Some have syrup in them.

1143
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,080
What's this?

1144
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,440
Is this syrup? Isn't this syrup?

1145
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,880
Could there be something inside the syrup?

1146
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,560
Is there something wrong with the syrup?
Should we stir it?

1147
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,840
That thing of mine from security.

1148
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,320
No

1149
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,840
There's a simple way to turn it over.

1150
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,640
Just tip it here and see if there's anything inside.

1151
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,240
Come on, give me a hand.

1152
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Come on, let's do it together.
Let's do it together, come on.

1153
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:21,600
Nice

1154
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,400
All that working out paid off.

1155
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,720
Is there anything inside?

1156
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,800
Yes, there's a brick.

1157
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,800
Wait a second.

1158
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,200
Knocked out.

1159
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,040
Open it. What's inside?

1160
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,760
A phone manual.

1161
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,600
This phone can be set up

1162
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,440
and run two independent

1163
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,200
operating systems.
Two operating systems.

1164
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,080
You can set different lock screen passwords for each.

1165
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Enter different passwords

1166
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,320
to access the corresponding system.

1167
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,000
The label on the bottle says this is

1168
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,600
strong sleep spray.

1169
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,320
So it knocks you out.
The word at the end

1170
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,080
After inhaling the spray

1171
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,760
you'll enter a deep sleep state.

1172
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,600
It lasts at least six hours.

1173
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,440
It's a colorless liquid. If it touches wall paint

1174
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
it will turn purple after an hour.

1175
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,880
Look for purple on the wall.

1176
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,120
Just go to the food delivery counter.

1177
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,800
The food delivery counter.

1178
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,840
I'll go out and take a look.

1179
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,240
Is there?

1180
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,080
Wouldn't this need to be completely torn down?

1181
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,240
I found something.

1182
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,480
What?

1183
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,320
The password is 1818.

1184
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,080
After unlocking it, there's another system.

1185
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:53,880
This...
Over there.

1186
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,840
This place.

1187
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,960
That means...

1188
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,920
It was sprayed here.

1189
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,400
Golden ladle.

1190
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,120
Suppose I'm the boss.

1191
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,840
I'm here to pick up the food.

1192
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,280
Mr. Jin, I'm here to pick up the food.

1193
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,720
Maybe he comes at seven.

1194
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,880
What?

1195
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,040
I know, it might not be her.

1196
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,400
No.

1197
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,680
I know it's right here.

1198
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,920
You've been covering for her all along.

1199
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,360
Stop talking.
Wait a moment, come in first.

1200
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,320
That's true.

1201
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,480
He's been covering up the whole time.

1202
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,120
When has he ever been covering for me?

1203
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,120
Just now, we talked about that three-minute thing.

1204
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,840
He's been covering up ever since.

1205
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,960
Come in first.

1206
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,880
Wait a second.
This just now.

1207
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,400
Just now, we...

1208
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,760
Didn't we already find this thing?

1209
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,200
It says underneath.
This phone can be set up

1210
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,920
and run two completely separate systems.

1211
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,440
The first time, the password I saw was

1212
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,560
8888.

1213
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,640
Because we were in that
There is something in his office

1214
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,800
It needs to be sent, it needs to be sent

1215
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,480
Isn't that 1818

1216
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,440
1818

1217
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,800
So after opening it
It goes into another system

1218
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,920
There's something called Green Screen Assistant

1219
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,400
That's right

1220
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,360
And here is an image library

1221
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,440
Inside, there's a picture

1222
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,520
Crime scene
Of the crime scene

1223
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,440
A background he prepared

1224
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,200
Right, he just needs to take the boss

1225
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Cut out the green screen part

1226
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
And put this person here

1227
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,760
Is that how it works?
Golden Spoon

1228
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,960
Yes

1229
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,880
You've already seen through it

1230
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,480
I think it's too obvious
That's right

1231
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,240
He must have waited

1232
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
Until it was time to deliver breakfast

1233
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,760
The boss was there receiving breakfast

1234
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,480
It started up

1235
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,640
He knocked out the boss and put him here first

1236
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,920
He was killed with a hammer at seven o'clock.

1237
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,080
After leaving at 6:57,

1238
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,240
any time between then and eight is possible.

1239
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,280
Everyone had time.

1240
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,920
Any of the four of us could have done it.

1241
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,480
But right now, too much points to her.

1242
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,080
I don't really think it's her.

1243
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,040
Alright.

1244
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,760
Then let's gather all the evidence we've found.

1245
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,400
Let's take everything.

1246
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,640
Then let's go to that room and discuss.

1247
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:41,960
Okay.
Alright.

1248
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,520
Okay, I think in my mind,

1249
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,800
the four people are equal.

1250
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,080
The important point to me is

1251
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,680
he has to know

1252
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,760
that

1253
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,080
boss.
That's right, that

1254
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,160
Right? I know what you're thinking.

1255
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,480
I also think this is very important.

1256
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,880
It's just that
I think this is extremely important.

1257
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,360
Yeah.

1258
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,120
Actually, there's one thing

1259
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,360
I've always felt his motive isn't strong.

1260
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,160
No, it's that the motive isn't strong.
His

1261
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,560
Doesn't really seem like a suspect.

1262
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,400
Why?
Well, look,

1263
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,040
the four of us,

1264
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,840
we're still going over that 57-minute mark.

1265
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,440
Why would the killer record that video at seven o'clock?

1266
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,840
Why go and film that video?

1267
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,520
Wasn't it just to

1268
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,480
create an alibi for himself?

1269
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,120
Right.

1270
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,440
So I was just

1271
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:24,960
I was just thinking,

1272
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,040
analyzing the four of us,

1273
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,760
the point where we all gave each other alibis.

1274
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,000
Look at the two of us,

1275
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,880
it was at 58 minutes.

1276
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,520
He came out of the bathroom after washing up.

1277
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
I went into the bathroom and ran into him.

1278
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,920
There wasn't much intention behind it.

1279
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,880
He just came out after washing up.

1280
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,440
He didn't say he had to be there

1281
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,480
so someone would see him.

1282
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,840
You were the one who bumped into him.

1283
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,320
So it couldn't have been planned by him.

1284
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,600
Right, it couldn't have been his plan.

1285
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,480
Yeah, because I didn't know who

1286
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,840
would be in the hallway at what time.

1287
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,760
So he's less suspicious.

1288
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,080
Yeah.

1289
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,280
I agree with what he said.

1290
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,400
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,

1291
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,600
Ke An is the least suspicious.

1292
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,920
In my opinion

1293
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,520
I think the most important thing is

1294
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,680
he has to know

1295
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,120
about the environment we're in

1296
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,680
Heniba is the only one

1297
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,040
who knows that our factory

1298
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,080
is not a real factory

1299
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,600
You need to find out what we're doing.

1300
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,680
You know about this streaming company.

1301
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,840
And the fact that the streaming company uses a green screen.

1302
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Maybe you already know about all of this.

1303
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,120
Yes, that's right.

1304
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,520
The green screen should also be

1305
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,800
an important point.

1306
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,800
So he knows about this.

1307
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,000
I really, I seriously suspect him right now.

1308
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,280
I am extremely, deeply suspicious of him.

1309
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,840
Why?

1310
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,560
I went into the bathroom at 55 minutes past.

1311
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,320
I washed up inside.

1312
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,960
For about three minutes.

1313
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,480
When I came out,

1314
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,440
I ran into him in the hallway.

1315
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Where was he going?
I didn't see that either.

1316
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,680
No, there's another issue.

1317
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,920
There was a period of time

1318
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,160
when you two didn't see each other.

1319
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,280
What about that time?

1320
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
So he wasn't going to the bathroom.

1321
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,400
All I can say is, I suspect him.

1322
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,360
You said you saw him.

1323
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,960
It just so happened

1324
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,000
that it was exactly at 57 minutes, when the food was delivered.

1325
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,680
So that means

1326
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,960
he was timing it for when you came to deliver the food.

1327
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,400
After he timed your food delivery,

1328
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,000
he immediately left right after.

1329
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,960
He went out and ran into me.

1330
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,600
That's right.

1331
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:21,920
And then,

1332
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,640
the next time I saw him return to the room

1333
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,920
was at 7:10.

1334
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,880
What I'm really curious about is

1335
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,280
where he was during those twelve minutes.

1336
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,640
Let me tell you, as your roommate,

1337
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,080
I know your daily habits.

1338
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,880
I pretty much know them.

1339
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,400
When you're almost done, I'll come out.

1340
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,840
I need to go wash up.

1341
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,280
After washing up, I'll come back for breakfast.

1342
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,040
That's a perfectly normal routine.

1343
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,920
When it comes to washing up, we're the same height and build.

1344
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,680
I take three minutes, you take twelve.

1345
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,440
Some people just like to be clean.

1346
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,480
Some people like to be clean.

1347
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,680
Is it wrong to like being clean?

1348
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,480
I love taking selfies.

1349
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,240
I have to finish taking pictures.

1350
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,120
Send them to my Bafentang.

1351
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,120
I want to show off my muscles.

1352
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,600
Then show me your selfies.

1353
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Take out your selfies.
If you don't have any photos,

1354
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,200
then you're making a false statement.

1355
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,640
Look at this spot.

1356
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:18,800
Jin Ba He Ke

1357
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,360
Jin Ba He Ke

1358
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,040
Only this person

1359
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,560
overlaps in all

1360
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,520
of our lines of sight.

1361
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,560
Do you know why?

1362
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,880
Because we weren't supposed to meet.

1363
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,920
I think you

1364
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,080
got beaten up by me that time

1365
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,800
and it messed up your brain.
I'm telling you,

1366
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,920
I went to the bathroom to wash up at 5:55.

1367
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,720
He didn't know when I would come out.

1368
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,840
This person couldn't be sure

1369
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,640
when today

1370
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,080
he could arrange this encounter.

1371
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,920
But there was one thing he could be sure of.

1372
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,960
That's the time when Jin Tangshao delivers the meal.

1373
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,800
6:57.

1374
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,400
Jin Tangshao did see him.

1375
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,920
Today, the younger brother deserves major credit for that.

1376
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,200
Don't get carried away.

1377
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,000
Don't let yourself get misled.

1378
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,120
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

1379
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:01,640
Let me tell you,
you can think

1380
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,520
that I'm highly suspicious.

1381
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,280
But those two

1382
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,280
are much more suspicious than us

1383
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,520
when it comes to initial suspicion.

1384
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,080
So his reasoning

1385
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,640
seems fine to me.

1386
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,360
But don't ignore her either, okay?

1387
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,720
Otherwise, all the suspicion

1388
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,600
will fall on him alone.

1389
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,680
I think that's a bit unfair.

1390
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,000
Why is it unfair?

1391
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,920
What's unfair about it?

1392
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,680
What's unfair about this situation?

1393
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,320
Others are also highly suspicious.

1394
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:23,920
What?

1395
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,640
Is he your own son or something?

1396
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
What's unfair about it?

1397
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,120
Yes, that's right.
He's my X.

1398
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,440
He's my X.

1399
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,960
I'm really speechless.

1400
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,840
That means I'm getting close.

1401
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,760
If we keep pressing, someone will get caught.

1402
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,200
Do you understand?

1403
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,480
Don't try to stir things up.

1404
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,240
You'll regret it, little brother.

1405
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,800
Regret it, little brother.

1406
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,280
Will I regret it?

1407
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,640
So who do you think it is?

1408
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,160
Between the two of them,

1409
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,720
I can only choose one.

1410
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,040
For the killer to commit the crime,

1411
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,720
they'd have to know

1412
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,560
the boss

1413
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,200
when the boss would leave that

1414
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,120
so they could run into the boss.

1415
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,680
Right, they have to know.

1416
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,720
They have to know.

1417
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,960
Which of the four of us is most likely to know?

1418
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,680
Me.
Of course it's you.

1419
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,000
Right now, I feel

1420
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,600
Ba is, in my mind,

1421
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,480
the most suspicious.

1422
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,280
If we rank by motive,

1423
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,480
the two of us have the strongest motives.

1424
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,640
Because we are directly involved in the case.

1425
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,560
We carry that burden.
My sister is already dead.

1426
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,240
She already jumped off the building.

1427
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,400
So your purpose for coming here

1428
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,600
is to investigate.

1429
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,560
Yes.

1430
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,080
Little Mantou.

1431
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,680
He loved eating my mantou the most.

1432
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,960
They said a child died.

1433
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,040
He ate that poisoned mooncake.

1434
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,800
That's right.

1435
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,440
I've been investigating this matter all along.

1436
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,200
Yes.

1437
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,240
Just now, another time was suggested.

1438
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,920
It was deliberately arranged.

1439
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,440
He was sitting there waiting for me.

1440
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,320
He came to deliver food at 57 minutes past.
Okay.

1441
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
You two are the main suspects in this.

1442
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,440
At 6:57.

1443
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,360
I was delivering breakfast to everyone.

1444
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,240
At that time,

1445
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,880
Jin Tangshao, Ba Fentang, and Heniba

1446
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,840
At that time,

1447
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,200
the three of them had alibis.

1448
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,880
Yes.

1449
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,240
So different circles have different intersections.

1450
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,600
Ba is always inside.

1451
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,360
So in my heart,

1452
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,880
I feel Ba is more important.

1453
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,680
Okay, that's fine.

1454
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,120
Green screen.

1455
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,880
I think it's this one.

1456
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,560
People who know about this probably also...

1457
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,800
But Sister Bafentang

1458
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,240
has done live streaming before.

1459
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,360
So she really understands this logic.

1460
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,000
She realized that here

1461
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,640
is basically a huge live streaming set.

1462
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,600
That makes sense.

1463
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,520
That makes sense.

1464
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,760
Then you used this method

1465
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,800
to get my sister killed.

1466
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,440
Today, I'll let you experience

1467
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,320
what it's like to pull a switcheroo.

1468
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:27,840
Yeah.

1469
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,400
When those two talk,

1470
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,440
they keep looking into each other's eyes.

1471
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,520
When those two talk,

1472
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,560
they keep looking into each other's eyes.

1473
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,720
Can you guys pay a little more attention?

1474
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,520
I look people in the eye no matter who I'm talking to.

1475
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,000
No,

1476
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,640
even when he talks to us,

1477
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,800
they're still looking at each other.

1478
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,040
Can you be a bit more aware of that?

1479
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,480
But I don't think X and the culprit

1480
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,880
would make it so obvious.

1481
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,040
Because none of you noticed,

1482
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,840
only I was watching.
Because I am

1483
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,400
Have you been watching me all along?

1484
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,160
Whenever I make eye contact with someone,

1485
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,640
you get uncomfortable.

1486
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,920
That makes sense too.

1487
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,720
That's possible as well.

1488
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,080
The sudden development of a love story

1489
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,520
I've made my choice

1490
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,040
I have

1491
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,240
Who do you want to vote for?

1492
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,640
Tell me, who do you want to vote for?

1493
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,240
One of the two of them

1494
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,960
This case

1495
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,840
The real culprit I believe is

1496
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,720
Heniba
His motive

1497
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,200
is the strongest among these four people

1498
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,320
Only he

1499
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,600
knows that our candy factory

1500
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,040
is not actually a real candy factory

1501
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,440
The most suspicious one is Heniba

1502
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,040
I hope I didn't vote for the wrong person

1503
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,240
Taking everything into account

1504
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,800
these factors make me think

1505
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,440
the suspicion is quite strong

1506
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,240
I hope I'm right

1507
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,240
The most suspicious suspect

1508
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:55,680
I vote for him

1509
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,120
Okay

1510
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,800
Today, my choice for the real culprit is

1511
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,680
The suspect I've identified is

1512
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,240
Bafentang

1513
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Her motive is

1514
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,560
After she snuck into the office

1515
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,000
she discovered the truth about everything

1516
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,320
so she wanted to kill Tan Qian

1517
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,560
that is, Tan Dadan

1518
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,800
to avenge her sister

1519
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,720
Because I think he also has a motive for the crime.

1520
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,400
And he also knows about this secret passage.

1521
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,640
I still think he might be the most suspicious.

1522
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,760
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1523
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,560
Unbeatable low prices can't be hidden

1524
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,640
Next, we move on to

1525
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,680
Tongcheng Travel

1526
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,600
the moment of truth revealed

1527
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,760
So nervous.

1528
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,400
Among today's case suspects,

1529
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,960
three people received votes.

1530
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,480
Three people.

1531
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,200
One player

1532
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,800
received two votes.

1533
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,760
And another player

1534
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,000
received one vote.

1535
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,840
Other than that,

1536
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,200
Another player received

1537
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,520
four votes.

1538
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,360
Four votes.

1539
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,040
You used two votes.

1540
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,800
I did.

1541
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
This round, your vote can count as two.

1542
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,000
This kind of card can't fall into his hands.

1543
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,800
It's over.

1544
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,520
So you used it.

1545
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,320
I used it.

1546
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:35,840
That makes seven votes.
Seven votes.

1547
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,640
First, the player who received zero votes is

1548
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,880
Ke Ankan.

1549
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,320
And then?

1550
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,520
The player who received two votes is

1551
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,800
Ba Fentang.

1552
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,400
Heniba

1553
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,240
I have two votes.

1554
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,360
You gave both your votes to me.

1555
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,000
Can I give both my votes to you?

1556
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,560
So who did you all vote for?

1557
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,560
That means the culprit and X voted for me.

1558
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,360
So is it Golden Spoon

1559
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,120
or Bafentang who got four votes?

1560
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,600
Don't laugh, your smile is scaring me.

1561
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,080
You two have already made up your minds, right?

1562
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,440
You both probably voted for Bafentang, right?

1563
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,000
You guys...

1564
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,600
The one who got four votes is

1565
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
Golden Spoon.

1566
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,800
How is that possible?

1567
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,600
Who did you say voted for whom?

1568
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,120
Who actually voted for her?

1569
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,920
Impossible, I voted for Bafentang.

1570
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,080
Why aren't you listening?

1571
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,880
Wasn't it him?

1572
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,880
Didn't he say he voted for himself?

1573
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,560
Why do you have four votes?

1574
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,080
I don't know, you gave me two votes.

1575
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,760
Why do you have two votes?

1576
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,400
The culprit and X voted for me.

1577
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,760
Wait a second.

1578
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,200
The culprit and X voted for you.

1579
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,800
I voted for you.

1580
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,640
I voted for him.

1581
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,480
The two of us aren't the culprit and X.

1582
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,440
Still acting? You guys are really something.

1583
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,760
Stop joking around, man.

1584
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,680
I'm really not acting.

1585
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,680
It's very likely that her long-term behavior

1586
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,160
delivering breakfast at 57 minutes past the hour

1587
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,680
was a carefully planned alibi.

1588
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,960
So I think Golden Spoon is

1589
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,960
the most suspicious suspect.

1590
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,240
I vote for her.

1591
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,280
My choice for the real culprit is

1592
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:29,960
Golden Spoon.

1593
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,200
Motive: to avenge her deceased child.

1594
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,600
I'm using

1595
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,200
my double voting right.

1596
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,440
I'm casting my precious vote for Golden Spoon.

1597
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,000
Today, the culprit I'm choosing is

1598
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,560
Heniba.

1599
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,480
I was the one you two had to choose between.

1600
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,640
We chose you.

1601
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,360
Between the two of us, you picked me.

1602
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,000
That's right.

1603
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,640
Huh, what are you thinking about?

1604
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,480
It's not like you picked me for a relationship.

1605
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,360
You picked me as the real culprit.

1606
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,640
Then who voted for me?

1607
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,120
I did.
The two of us voted for you.
You two?

1608
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,080
So I'm not the dumbest one after all.

1609
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,160
No, you're not.

1610
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,600
Why did you two vote for me?

1611
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,200
Based on your theory.

1612
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,680
No, what I said actually made sense.

1613
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,080
Yeah, what he said really made sense.

1614
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,760
Let me tell you,

1615
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,600
In the end, you two were like hidden geniuses.

1616
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,960
Next, let's reveal whether everyone

1617
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,200
successfully identified the culprit.

1618
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,800
Including those who didn't succeed.

1619
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,000
Why do you have that expression?

1620
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,520
We did it.

1621
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,320
In this game,

1622
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,720
we lost, right?

1623
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,320
We lost.

1624
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,320
You go first, who is the real culprit?

1625
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:40,880
Her.

1626
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,080
Why is it me?

1627
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,120
You.

1628
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,240
It's not me.

1629
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,880
"Add one to ignorance."

1630
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,960
The real culprit is...

1631
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,080
It's been narrowed down, right?

1632
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,680
The real culprit is...

1633
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,880
I'm so nervous.

1634
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,600
Ba Fen candy

1635
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,280
Why would you vote for me?

1636
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,920
I almost ended up with zero votes.

1637
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,760
Next,

1638
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,400
let's have Bafentang announce

1639
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,200
whether there is an X this round, and who X is.

1640
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,480
X is him.

1641
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:39,800
It hasn't been announced yet.

1642
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,400
X is him.

1643
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,600
Hey you, what's wrong with you?
Who's talking to you? Go away.

1644
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,600
You.
I've lost one of mine.

1645
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,640
Didn't choose you.

1646
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,440
The crucial piece of evidence that was missed is

1647
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,520
underneath the circular conveyor belt at Bafentang's place

1648
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,280
there was a bloodstained candy stuck there

1649
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,280
The blood on this candy

1650
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,560
was left by Bafentang earlier while working

1651
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,360
when he accidentally got injured

1652
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,360
The bloodstained candy accidentally fell into the pile of candies

1653
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,320
and was packed and shipped

1654
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
But after a few days

1655
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,800
it came back on the conveyor belt

1656
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,880
and ended up back in Bafentang's hands

1657
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,480
This made Bafentang realize

1658
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,640
that the factory's candy production

1659
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,240
was just a facade

1660
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,440
Is there something inside this?

1661
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,080
Syrup
Okay

1662
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,520
So our two minutes

1663
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,680
is basically impossible

1664
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,280
It's just me and Ba, right?

1665
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,240
Isn't three minutes not enough? I want to ask

1666
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,600
Three minutes

1667
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,240
Just the conveyor belt alone takes that long

1668
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,480
Then you have to set it up and record

1669
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,600
It seems like everyone's time

1670
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,320
isn't really enough

1671
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:01,520
Yeah

1672
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
When I came out

1673
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,840
I ran into him (Heniba) in the hallway

1674
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,000
No, there's another issue

1675
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,160
There was a period of time when you two

1676
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,600
didn't see each other, right?

1677
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,240
Sister Bafentang has done live streaming before.

1678
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,400
So she really understands how this works.

1679
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,480
She realized this place is basically

1680
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,720
a huge live streaming set.

1681
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,840
When the two of them were talking,

1682
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,840
they kept looking at each other.

1683
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,080
Can you two pay a little more attention?

1684
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,360
You need a green screen, right?

1685
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Or at least the same space.

1686
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,040
That's the only way you could film that video.

1687
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,720
Outside the serving window,

1688
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,640
aren't there a bunch of green boxes?

1689
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,680
What do you mean, kill at the serving window?

1690
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,560
I just said on the show earlier

1691
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,520
that the highlight of this episode was on the younger brother

1692
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,560
who cast the crucial vote

1693
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,720
You might as well not have said that

1694
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,080
Now the situation looks even worse

1695
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,840
Yeah

1696
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,280
And you even

1697
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,640
He even emphasized that this was the highlight

1698
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,120
So you were the one who started all this

1699
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:54,600
No, but it doesn't matter

1700
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
This is our darkest moment, okay?

1701
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,280
You did really well today

1702
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,240
Because before I voted

1703
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,040
I kept hesitating

1704
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,760
Between you and him, who is X after all

1705
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,680
But I can remember

1706
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,240
every single thing you said

1707
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,640
Was it this person or that person

1708
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,480
I can't remember anything Bai said

1709
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,080
Not a single word comes to mind

1710
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,480
I just can't recall
When you see him

1711
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,760
you've already lost your mind

1712
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,120
So you

1713
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,400
No, I have a conclusion about him

1714
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,920
Because someone who can act like this

1715
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,440
We define him with four words

1716
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,480
"Either foolish or evil"

1717
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,680
He's not "foolish"

1718
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,480
He can only be
absolutely "evil"

1719
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,400
"Evil"

1720
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,720
Our judgment about you is

1721
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,680
You can't possibly be "evil"

1722
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,640
You can only be "foolish"

1723
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,680
The six of us being able to make it here

1724
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,280
is actually pretty "naive" of us.

1725
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,320
But I was right all day today.

1726
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,920
Don't try to save face now.

1727
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,640
Just let it go.
That's enough.

1728
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,600
Next,

1729
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
Ba Fentang and Bai Huanzi, please

1730
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,760
come collect your golden keys.

1731
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,640
Did you double your points?

1732
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,680
Congratulations, really.

1733
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,360
Not doubled yet.

1734
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,080
Currently, on the golden key leaderboard,

1735
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,200
Ba Fentang and Bai Huanzi are tied for first.

1736
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,160
We're tied for second.
That's pretty good, pretty good.

1737
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,560
Pretty good.
Alright.

1738
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,040
In the end, for today,

1739
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,080
she hid herself really well.

1740
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,560
Not many of us suspected her.

1741
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,120
That's right.
Exactly.

1742
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,880
That scared me to death.
You startled me.

1743
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,240
That's the person.

1744
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,840
Hello, everyone.

1745
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,280
We already met this morning.

1746
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,600
But things were a bit chaotic then.

1747
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
You all startled me.

1748
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,800
Now, let me

1749
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,160
introduce myself again.

1750
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,560
I am Tan Qian's investor.

1751
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,120
I invested in his Tui Tian Food Factory.

1752
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,160
I put in five million.

1753
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,440
So this livestream business is yours.

1754
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,040
But I didn't expect

1755
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,920
that he would actually die.

1756
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,320
He may be gone,

1757
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,440
but my money can't go to waste.

1758
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,480
So from today on,

1759
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,680
I'll be taking over Tui Tian Food Factory.

1760
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,880
In other words,

1761
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,400
I'm your boss now.

1762
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,840
You can call me President An.

1763
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,400
President An.

1764
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,760
We didn't sign a contract with you.

1765
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,720
We're not working anymore.

1766
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,840
Those who play games, go play games.

1767
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,120
Those who are "going to jail" should go "to jail" now.

1768
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,960
I'm quitting.
Because she just killed someone.

1769
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,760
We have a contract with this food factory.

1770
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,680
We're back to being "ignorant" workers again.

1771
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:08,800
Everyone, don't worry.

1772
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,439
The things Tan Qian did before

1773
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,640
I knew nothing about them.

1774
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,640
But I will shut down the factory's livestream.

1775
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,319
I'll also organize all the related documents.

1776
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,520
And put them in the secret room.

1777
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,120
Until I get to the bottom of Tan Qian's matters

1778
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,240
and finish the investigation,

1779
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,680
no one is allowed to leave here.

1780
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,520
Please rest assured.

1781
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,160
No one who did wrong will get away.

1782
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,359
They will all get the punishment they deserve.

1783
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:30,439
You two, in a bit,

1784
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:31,880
go tidy up the secret room in Tan Qian's office.

1785
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,640
Clean it up.
I need to use it.

1786
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,080
Yes.

1787
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,520
As for the rest of you,
if there's nothing else,

1788
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,560
you can go back to the dorm and rest.

1789
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,600
We'll talk tomorrow.

1790
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,279
Okay.
Alright.

1791
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,200
Let's go.

1792
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,880
Thank you, thank you, Director An.

1793
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,680
Maybe a promotion and a raise.

1794
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,279
Okay.
Let's go.

1795
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,200
Alright, go back and get a good night's sleep.

1796
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,240
Clear your head a bit.

1797
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,000
Not bad, you did pretty well.

1798
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,640
Good, keep it up.

1799
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:06,880
Then tonight

1800
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,359
I'll be the one to watch over this "little rascal"

1801
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,279
Come with me

1802
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,479
Come with me

1803
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,800
Because of the current state of the internet

1804
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,720
and its rapid development,
live-streaming sales

1805
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:26,359
have also become

1806
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,399
a very popular way to shop.

1807
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:29,840
Just like Tan Qian in the story,

1808
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,240
he also saw this trend

1809
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,240
so he approached my "sister"

1810
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,960
to do live-streaming sales.

1811
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,120
But his problem was that

1812
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,319
because he saw these advantages,

1813
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,800
he made money,

1814
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,200
so he wanted to take advantage of small gains,

1815
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,160
which led him to do things that might

1816
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,600
harm consumers,

1817
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,280
certain actions.

1818
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,120
For example, selling fake mooncakes

1819
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,760
or selling fake candies.

1820
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,120
My impression of the live-streaming room

1821
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,000
was very shocking.

1822
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,880
I think it's very similar to the scenes

1823
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,120
we created in our show,

1824
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:56,880
but it's also very much like

1825
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,560
real-life situations.

1826
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,840
Welcome everyone to Xiaobei's

1827
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,960
card-unboxing live-stream.

1828
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,520
Welcome to Sad Little Crab's live-stream.

1829
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,960
Welcome everyone to the Elite live-stream.

1830
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,960
In recent years,

1831
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,160
people have come to feel that

1832
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,360
live-streaming is a big opportunity,

1833
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,080
and many have rushed into this field.

1834
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,120
That's right.

1835
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,360
It's a Dilraba Dilmurat-inspired makeup look.

1836
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,760
Today is a special session for traditional-style dance.

1837
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,440
Let's show everyone

1838
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,200
today's cards.

1839
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,320
Today's game rule is matching pairs.

1840
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,480
This handsome guy

1841
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,800
I also want to check your pulse.

1842
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,720
Looking at each box,

1843
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,840
everyone is livestreaming.

1844
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,160
It feels as if what I see

1845
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,440
are not living, breathing people

1846
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,880
but rather one after another

1847
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,160
of puppets controlled by online traffic

1848
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,400
So actually, I feel quite deeply about this.

1849
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,720
Which celebrity's livestream do you want to hear about?

1850
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,920
Which celebrity's livestream?

1851
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,360
Does this sound familiar?

1852
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,400
Do you want to hear about the nine-character actress?

1853
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,680
I'll just give you that.

1854
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,200
It's the latest flight number of the nine-character actress.

1855
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:47,760
I'll give it to you.

1856
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,000
It's really against the law.

1857
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,320
I really can't believe it.

1858
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,480
They're in the livestream room

1859
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,520
revealing some people's private information

1860
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,040
and some people's schedules.

1861
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,800
Some people's private lives

1862
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,040
are openly priced.

1863
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,680
Then they're chewed up and fed to the audience.

1864
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,800
Another perk is

1865
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,640
the "color system,"
and two-character male actors.

1866
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,680
I'll just give you his

1867
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,320
parents' phone numbers directly.

1868
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
All of this is illegal.

1869
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:14,840
Sometimes,

1870
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,280
I also come across these kinds of livestreams.

1871
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,200
And I can even see myself in them.

1872
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,280
At that moment,

1873
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,560
I just want to say, this is already so outrageous,

1874
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,440
yet so many people in the comments actually believe it.

1875
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,640
Actually, I

1876
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,360
have another little piece of gossip to share with you.

1877
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:25,920
Shut up.

1878
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,360
I've personally experienced

1879
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,920
some pretty crazy stalker behavior.

1880
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,480
Like someone coming to knock on your door,

1881
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,520
or someone standing at your door

1882
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,760
trying to talk to you,

1883
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,880
or shouting things.

1884
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,680
They try every possible way

1885
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,000
to get closer to your private life.

1886
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,040
It really can be quite troubling.

1887
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:45,800
I think

1888
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,720
livestreaming is developing very quickly now,

1889
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,320
and a lot of people are paying attention to it

1890
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,960
and want to get involved.

1891
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,200
What I want to say is,

1892
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,960
I want to remind everyone to raise their own awareness.

1893
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,120
Awareness of prevention

1894
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,200
Don’t be easily fooled by any

1895
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,080
trendy thing right now

1896
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,120
so easily

1897
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,360
Livestreams

1898
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:03,920
are fine to watch

1899
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,280
but I think there should be moderation

1900
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,520
Because from my own experience, I feel

1901
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,640
we should spend more of our time

1902
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,400
on ourselves

1903
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,560
and self-improvement is the most important

1904
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,200
If you buy some fake or poor-quality products

1905
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,400
you should learn to use the law to protect your rights

1906
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,520
Understand the platform’s rules and relevant laws

1907
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,080
Only in this way

1908
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,080
can we enjoy the convenience of livestream shopping

1909
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,160
better

1910
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,400
and better protect our own rights

1911
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,280
I hope that everyone watching this episode

1912
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,240
all adults

1913
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,200
will have the ability

1914
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,080
to distinguish right from wrong in these matters

1915
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,520
Of course, I also hope that the livestream industry

1916
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,800
will become more and more regulated

1917
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,640
This issue

1918
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,200
still needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

1919
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,600
Mainly, we need to look at

1920
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,800
what role the streamer plays in this situation.

1921
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,760
what kind of role is being played.

1922
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,960
There are mainly three scenarios.

1923
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,520
The first is when the streamer is the seller.

1924
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,280
In this case,

1925
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,800
if they fail to fulfill

1926
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
their obligations as a seller,

1927
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,240
for example, before purchasing goods,

1928
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,280
they should check

1929
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,680
whether there is a product quality certificate.

1930
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,920
In such a situation,

1931
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,360
according to
the "People's Republic of China

1932
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,160
Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests,"

1933
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,800
the "Product Quality Law of the People's Republic of China,"

1934
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,040
including
the "E-commerce Law of the People's Republic of China,"

1935
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,320
and so on,

1936
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,480
a series of legal provisions,

1937
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,920
if consumers find problems with the product,

1938
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,760
they can first ask the streamer

1939
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,040
that is, the seller,

1940
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,000
to take responsibility for compensation first.

1941
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,640
Of course, after the streamer has compensated,

1942
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,840
if it turns out the problem

1943
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,680
was actually caused by the manufacturer,

1944
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,440
they can then seek compensation from the manufacturer.

1945
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,800
The second situation is

1946
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,520
the host

1947
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,960
is actually just an advertising spokesperson.

1948
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,240
For example,

1949
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,080
we often invite some well-known figures

1950
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,920
to endorse a certain product.

1951
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,880
In this case,

1952
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,000
the advertising spokesperson

1953
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,160
also has certain responsibilities.

1954
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,000
The third situation is

1955
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,720
the host

1956
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,160
is simply recommending the product.

1957
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,200
He is not responsible for selling it.

1958
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,320
He has also fulfilled

1959
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,120
his reasonable duty of review.

1960
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,400
There is no fault.

1961
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,360
In this situation,
the main responsibility

1962
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,200
still lies with the seller of the product.

1963
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:08,520
Everyone is

1964
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,920
destined for four different kinds of death.

1965
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Evacuate immediately

1966
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,760
Who will be lucky enough to survive until the end

1967
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,560
Violence
Invasion of privacy

1968
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:23,880
Spreading rumors
Greed

1969
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,160
Incitement

1970
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,480
Live killing broadcast

1971
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,880
About to begin

1972
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,760
Live killing broadcast

1973
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,640
Reba, get out of here quickly

1974
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,560
Get out of the way

1975
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,080
Go quickly
Go

1976
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,520
Help

1977
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,440
It's getting deeper and deeper

1978
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,640
Then what about him

1979
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,360
If I catch anyone lying

1980
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,920
I'll immediately lock onto the culprit

1981
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:48,960
Why don't you confess on your own

1982
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,560
Alright?

1983
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,560
Want to kill you

1984
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,800
List of accomplices

1985
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,960
Don't even know who you've harmed

1986
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,040
I just want to kill him

1987
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,120
He deserves to die

1988
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,600
And who are you

1989
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,840
So none of you are good people

1990
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,000
Don't come blaming me

1991
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,760
You've learned everything you should know

1992
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,760
And what you shouldn't know, you'll never find out

1993
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,880
I just want to watch people die one by one

1994
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,600
Congratulations

1995
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,000
Escape failed

1996
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:15,960
Help

1997
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,400
Exactly
Murder live stream

1998
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,480
It was the audience who closed the door

1999
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,280
Zhou Keyu

2000
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,640
May I ask who this is

2001
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,680
I really can't tell

2002
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,720
It looks so old-fashioned at first glance
This childhood photo

2003
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,720
I am the culprit in this case, Bafentang.

2004
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,600
I realized that the factory's green walls

2005
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,720
were actually for the convenience of

2006
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,640
changing backgrounds online with chroma key.

2007
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,920
All of us

2008
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,320
were being secretly recorded by hidden cameras.

2009
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,280
We became unwitting protagonists.

2010
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:50,880
She also said

2011
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,760
that you can make a full Manchu Han Imperial Feast with just one shrimp.

2012
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,240
Why are you, as a chef, cutting corners?

2013
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:55,520
So spicy.

2014
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:56,640
Just like me.

2015
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,840
The main thing is, I'm not hungry at all.

2016
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,400
So beautiful.

2017
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,680
With you here, we never have to worry about supplies.

2018
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,960
You two are like old fathers.

2019
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:07,920
