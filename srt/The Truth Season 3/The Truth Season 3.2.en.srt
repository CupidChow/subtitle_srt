1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,360
Welcome to

2
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,680
the team-building event for Season 3 of "Let's Start Reasoning"

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,000
Win a power-up card

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,120
This is exciting

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Hurry, I'm already in position

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,840
I feel like this power-up card is mine

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,120
Pig

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,480
There's a pig with a round head

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,640
Thin

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,760
Cold

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,440
Thick

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,680
Big

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,600
Small

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
It's up to us this time

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,920
Cow

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,960
Let's start grocery shopping

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Let's go

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,800
Why is this phone moving by itself, bro?

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,120
It's probably being controlled

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,760
The car is gone

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,920
Where's the car?

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,720
Are we stuck in a loop already?

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,120
No car

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,320
Then we can only walk back

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,960
Seriously?

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,160
But that's mainly the boss's car

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,600
His boss said the car is still needed

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,600
What should we do?
It's fine.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
Actually, here's how I see it.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
What can we do?
We can walk back.

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,800
Let's discuss compensation when we get back.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,800
We should have left someone to watch the car earlier.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,200
No.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,360
The main thing is, this person said

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,400
he's never seen us come here before.

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,280
That's a bit...

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
He said he's never seen us come here.

38
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Are we stuck in a loop already?

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,560
So if we go back to the grocery store,

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,120
will those two at the store recognize us?

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
Let's give it a try.

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,200
Seriously?

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Are we trapped in a strange cycle?

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
People who have seen us

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,480
will forget us in ten minutes.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
Have you seen us before?

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
You're Zhang Linghe.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
He said I'm Zhang Linghe.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,440
No, Zhou Conan, that's wrong.

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Zhou Conan.

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,080
Right.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,320
Zhou Conan.

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Our car just now
was parked at the entrance and got stolen.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
Do you remember ever doing this before?

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,600
How could that be possible?
So where's the car?

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
It's this person.

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,600
Do you know this person?
The one standing at the entrance.

58
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,520
They said they drove here.

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,480
I didn't see you drive.

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
You walked here.

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
You must have driven here.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Because my leg is a prosthetic, I can't walk here.

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,680
So how many of us did you see?

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,959
I don't know.

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,440
Start a Tuin Farm.

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Start a Tuin Farm.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,040
Just these few people.

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,480
Well, here's the thing, I happen to have a car.

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
You have a car?

70
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,760
You have another car?

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,080
You should've said so earlier.

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,200
Why didn't you say that before?

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,760
No.

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
What about our car?

75
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Doesn't matter, forget it for now.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Okay, no problem.

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Just tell him the place later.

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,120
Speak slower, I can't really understand.

79
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,880
No, who can understand him? Someone talk to him.

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,520
What?

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Anyway, just get there.

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
Let my little brother know.

83
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,040
My little brother's car will take you.

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,440
Alright.
His car will take us?

85
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,840
He'll take you.

86
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Take us.

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,120
What?

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
Take us.

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
He scratched our car.

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,320
"Kedaole"

91
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
This car.

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
Really?

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
That's what I said.

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Your "BMW" is really cool.

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Get in the car.

96
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
Just let him know when you get to your destination.

97
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Thanks.

98
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
Will this fit everyone?

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
Two people can get on first.

100
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,640
Then the two of us will crouch in the middle.

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,560
Two people sit at the back.
That makes six people exactly.

102
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Ning, the two of us will bring up the rear.
Okay.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Is that okay?
Seems like it works.

104
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,280
It works.

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Come on.

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
Zhang Linghe, it's fine if you don't help me.

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,240
And now you want to pull me down with you?

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
Are you seated properly?

109
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
All set.
Let's go.

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,440
I don't think the horse can even run.
Will this push us back?

111
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Do you want to feel the push?

112
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,280
No.

113
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
They're leading it just fine.

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
So many twists and turns.

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
Everything was fine when we came.

116
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,240
Now we can't go back.

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
You should be thinking now

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
about how to talk to the boss later.

119
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
It still has to be you.
You just say it, that's it.

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,280
Why should I be the one to say it?

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
You have to take responsibility for this.

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,280
Is this how you act as a brother?

123
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,320
This is exactly how I act as a brother.

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,560
You have to represent us and convince the boss.

125
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,920
Alright.

126
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,400
That's not important.
Whether we have the car or not doesn't matter.

127
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,200
What matters is that we made it back.

128
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,480
Okay.
Okay.

129
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
Erniu, I'm leaving.

130
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm going to the city to study.

131
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Wait for me.
Yan Zi.

132
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Yan Zi.

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,160
How can I live without you?

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,120
Yan Zi, how am I supposed to live without you?

135
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,360
There's still one thing we haven't done.

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,440
What is it?
We still haven't gone back to fish.

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,640
Right.

138
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Pickled fish.

139
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,200
We're here.

140
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,280
Get off.

141
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,040
Go!

142
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,040
We're back.

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,920
Who's swinging here?

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,480
Who's on the swing?

145
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Hello, everyone.

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,640
Hello.

147
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,760
You are...

148
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
The crew of "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
You're here for a team-building event, right?

150
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,760
Yes.
That's right.

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Welcome.

153
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,200
We've been here before.

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
Have you been here before?

155
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
I haven't hosted you before.

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
No.

157
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Let me introduce myself.
I'm the manager here.

158
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,200
You can just call me Xiao Zhu.

159
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,520
Let me introduce our place to you first.

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,240
Look, we have these staff members here.

161
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,920
There are three cats in total.

162
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,840
Three dogs.

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
A cow and a chicken.

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,160
Little Niu.
Little Huihui.

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
Little Cai.

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Wait, hold on.

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760
Their names have all changed.

168
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
The names of these animals have all changed.

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,320
I know this cow.

170
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
It used to be called Momo.

171
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
Badi has become Xiao Hei.

172
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Do you have a male boss here?

173
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,040
I am the manager of this estate.

174
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,520
My surname is Lin.

175
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,560
You can just call me Old Lin.

176
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Okay, Brother Lin.

177
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Do you have a male boss here?

178
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
No, it's just me.

179
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Do you recognize this key?

180
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,640
You're going grocery shopping, right?

181
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
Take my car.

182
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
I don't recognize it.

183
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,640
Refreshed

184
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Fallen into

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,720
The first day of the "Start Reasoning" loop

186
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
I am the manager of this manor

187
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,720
My surname is Lin

188
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,840
You can just call me Old Lin

189
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,000
I am the manager here

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,320
You can just call me Little Zhu

191
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,000
Did you even bring your own ingredients?

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes.
Let me take you over there.

193
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
Thank you. Let's go.

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
Wait, why are we doing this again?

195
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,760
The kitchen is just inside.

196
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,080
We know.

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
You know?
Yes.

198
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
Have you been here before?

199
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,600
We've been here.

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
I don't remember you.

201
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
Back then, it wasn't a woman boss.

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,840
It was a young man in charge.

203
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.
Really?

204
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,040
But I've been here these past few years.

205
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,880
Are you here during the day too?

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
During the day, I'm always on that swing.

207
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
Waiting for you.

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Come on, everyone, this way.

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
The kitchen is right here.

210
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,240
So just now

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
we started from the moment we bought groceries

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,040
and entered the loop

213
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,360
the people changed, the owner changed too

214
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
and we ended up in another world

215
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
Then just let me know if you need anything else.

216
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
I have something urgent to take care of.

217
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,760
I'll go handle it now.
Okay.

218
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
Goodbye.

219
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Alright, goodbye.

220
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
Alright, let's start cooking.

221
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,440
Let's start cooking.

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
There are aprons over here.

223
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
How do you put this on?

224
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you want one? Here, take one.

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Come on, like in a dating show.

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,920
It's like a dating show now.

227
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
Wait, you need to untie this first.

228
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,520
Wait a second.

229
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
Are you asking if I want it?

230
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
Are you asking if I want it?

231
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
Do you want it, Jin Jing?

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,960
It's not convenient for me.

233
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,080
If it's not convenient for you, I'll do it.

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,879
Is this okay?

235
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
It has to be like this.

236
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Thank you, Ling He.

237
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Where's your waist?

238
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Where's my waist?

239
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
What dish are you making?
You're making fish, right?

240
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes.

241
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm making spicy and sour shredded potatoes, just need to stir-fry it.

242
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,640
You need to cut it.

243
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,760
The potatoes don't need to be washed or cut.

244
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
Then you prepare the ingredients.

245
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
Right, I'll cut the ingredients first.

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Then cut my ingredients too while you're at it.

247
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,480
They're all shredded anyway.

248
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
What about my fish, guys?

249
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,920
You have to go fishing.

250
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,080
Can someone help me? Xiao Zhu?

251
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
Hello.

252
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
We want to go fishing.

253
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,640
Fishing?
Yes.

254
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
You can fish in our pond.

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,640
Alright, let's go fishing together.

256
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:51,960
Let's go.

257
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,080
Okay.
Let's go.

258
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
Let's go this way.

259
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Alright.

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,920
We'll walk along a mountain path.

261
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
Everyone, watch your step later.

262
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,520
Walking on a mountain path.

263
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,920
Go down and we'll be there.

264
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
This villa of yours—

265
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
Why is there so much smoke?

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
There's so much smoke.

267
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
I feel like something scary might fall out.

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't scare me.

269
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
How could that happen?

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,280
Maybe it's because the evening fog has set in.

271
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,840
Okay.

272
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,160
Has anything strange ever happened here?

273
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,760
No.
Have you ever suddenly

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
felt like your mind isn't working right,

275
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
and then felt like your memory disappeared?

276
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,640
No.

277
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,320
Have you ever felt

278
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
like sometimes you're a man?

279
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
I am a man.

280
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,720
Right.

281
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,880
No.

282
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
Everyone, just keep walking down this path.

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,080
We'll reach the fishing spot soon.

284
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Go down from here.

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,960
The fishing rods are all ready for you.

286
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,400
Okay.

287
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,200
Just fish, that's it.

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:55,960
Where's the hook?
The hook is at the very bottom.

289
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,080
Pull up the line.

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
Let me sit with my Sister Jin.

291
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,240
Move over and sit.

292
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,360
How do I get in here?

293
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
How did you do that? Teach me.

294
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
Bait the spot. Throw some bait in there.

295
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
What does "bait the spot" mean?

296
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,760
It means getting the fish to come over first.

297
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,920
Let them eat a little first.

298
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
Here, use this to throw some in.

299
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,400
I forbid you from pretending to be clueless again.

300
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,240
I really don't know how.

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,360
How do I throw it?

302
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,640
How do I throw it?
You throw it.

303
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,320
A little farther, just a bit.

304
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
Don't throw it too close.

305
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,960
Alright.

306
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
Alright, that's enough.

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,320
Don't overfeed it.

308
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,360
Slow down, you caught my fishnet stockings.

309
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
I can't see clearly.

310
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,400
What are you doing here?

311
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
You can't reach it from there.

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,240
How can you reach it like this?

313
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,640
Pull the rod back first.

314
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,720
It won't retract.

315
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
No, move back.

316
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
It's stuck.

317
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Move back.

318
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,160
Be careful.

319
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,280
Careful, the hook is sharp.

320
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,520
Where's the hook?

321
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,360
There are hooks under the green part.

322
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,160
Under this part, right?

323
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
Two small hooks.

324
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
There are worms here.

325
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,320
Really?

326
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,840
There are worms.

327
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,280
What is that?

328
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Did it jump onto your foot?

329
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
What?

330
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,840
Earthworm.

331
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,400
What's an earthworm called?
Give it to me.

332
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,560
Don't scare me.
Come on, give it to me.

333
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:43,880
What's an earthworm called?
It's fine.

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,560
It's alive, right?

335
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
It's alive.

336
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,960
I used to dare to catch them when I was a kid.
Now I really can't.

337
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,600
No.

338
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
Hook the whole earthworm.

339
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Hook the whole thing.
Two hooks.

340
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,360
Put one with that, one with corn.

341
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
A mix of meat and vegetables.

342
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
Should we look up how to fish?

343
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,880
Just put some meat in, that's it.

344
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,840
Then it'll come up.
That's good enough.

345
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Why does it feel like we're cooking?

346
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Really? I don't believe it.

347
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,920
Guys,

348
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,040
Let's go!

349
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,920
Alright!

350
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,800
Hurry, start.

351
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
Don’t you already have bait?

352
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,640
Then what about these?

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,040
What’s that sound?
The chair.

354
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Is it broken?
It’s broken.

355
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,160
It’s fine, I’ll just squat.

356
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
You’re really going to squat?

357
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
Here, I’ll get it for you.

358
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,640
I’ll get it for you.
It’s okay.

359
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,760
I’ll get it for you.

360
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
You’re making this too complicated.

361
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
Alright, your stool.

362
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,360
I don't quite understand.
This isn't a hook.

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
It's a loop.

364
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
Bring it over, let me see.

365
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Look.

366
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
How is this not a hook?

367
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,640
Isn't this a hook?

368
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,720
Be careful, there are hooks all over down here.

369
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I'll hang this one first.

370
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
The hooks are very sharp.

371
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,680
Be careful.
Watch out for the fishhooks.

372
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,840
Okay, take one and hang it up.

373
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,600
Be careful when you hang it.

374
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
This counts as hooked.

375
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,240
This counts as hooked.

376
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
Does it eat corn?

377
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,920
Yes, it eats corn.

378
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
A bit farther.

379
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
Is it this one?

380
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,400
Don't swing it.
Then how do I get it farther?

381
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,000
Get closer first.

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,560
First, hold the rod upright.

383
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Hold the rod first.

384
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
Wait, I'll hold it out upright.

385
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
Straight forward like this.

386
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,400
Impressive.

387
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,360
Like this, straight forward, right?

388
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,680
Right.

389
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes.

390
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,320
Okay.

391
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,880
Wait.

392
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
No, I mean this worm.

393
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,840
Isn't it a bit too big?

394
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,960
It's fine.

395
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
It'll come when it smells it.

396
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
Are there really any fish?

397
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,680
I also think there aren't any fish.

398
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,520
I have fish here.
Fishing rod.

399
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
It looks like your worm got eaten.

400
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,720
No, it didn't.

401
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,720
Or is the worm just swimming?

402
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,160
The worm is swimming and moving the whole fishing rod.

403
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,000
Alright, it's like working out.

404
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
Should we try fishing somewhere else?

405
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
Sure, let's change spots.

406
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
Feels like there are no fish here.

407
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,640
Okay.

408
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,400
There are some words over there.

409
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,720
Fishing nets have been set. Please be careful when retrieving them.

410
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
Alright.

411
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
Come on, there's a fishing net here.

412
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,640
What?
A fishing net.

413
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
There must be fish in that net.

414
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,920
Be careful.
Watch out.

415
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,760
There might be more than just fish.

416
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,160
There must be something inside.

417
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,920
Hope it's not that boss from earlier today.

418
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,840
Come on, guys, give me a hand.

419
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,440
Come on.

420
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,880
It's so long.

421
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,120
There's a fish.

422
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,240
Then I'll...

423
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
Be careful, don't slip.

424
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,720
I'll hold onto you.
Careful.

425
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
Hold on tight.
It's fine.

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,640
Let me do it.

427
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,280
It's so heavy.

428
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,840
There seems to be a box.

429
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,120
Okay.

430
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Be careful.
I'll pull.

431
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
Here, hold on, come on.

432
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,600
It's a box.

433
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,880
Why is there

434
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,440
a box here?

435
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,080
I don't get it.
It's open.

436
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,240
Open it.

437
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
What is this?

438
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
This is a person.

439
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Are these human bones?

440
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,840
Isn't this a human head? Isn't it?

441
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,320
It's been dismembered.

442
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,640
The head.

443
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Yes, there's a doll inside.

444
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,320
Is this a doll?

445
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,400
What should we do? Is there anything else?

446
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,440
A rock.

447
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,640
The rock is used to sink the suitcase.

448
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,400
What does this mean?

449
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
It means dismemberment.
Dismembered.

450
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,519
Then they sank it to the bottom of the sea with a rock.

451
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,880
I hope it's not that boss from earlier.

452
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,160
This doesn't look like an adult's body.

453
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
This is a child's toy.

454
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,319
Yes.
Because...

455
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,720
Only a child could fit in a suitcase.

456
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,559
So is this hair?

457
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,880
This should be hair.
Hair.

458
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,360
This hair...
If it's this long...

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,760
It must be a female.

460
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,960
So it's a little girl.

461
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,400
Yes.

462
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,200
It's already just bones.

463
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,880
It's been here for a long time.

464
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,120
Xiao Zhu

465
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Has someone been "killed" here before?

466
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,520
What?
What's wrong?

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,520
Look.
See for yourself.

468
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,000
What's this?

469
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,640
What is this?

470
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,680
That's a human bone.

471
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,760
Who set this net?

472
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,800
After the last group of tourists,

473
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,320
it's been left here since they left.

474
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
How long ago was that?

475
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
About a week ago.

476
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
That's impossible.

477
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,120
The box is many years old.

478
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,760
No.

479
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,240
Was it fished out from here?

480
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,960
Yes.

481
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,440
No.

482
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,160
This definitely isn't from our manor.

483
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
This definitely has nothing to do with us.

484
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,160
It must have drifted here from somewhere else.

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,200
It was tangled up with the fishing net.

486
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,600
Right.

487
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,880
I remember now.
Go on.

488
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,720
I remember now.

489
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,760
Things haven't been peaceful around here lately.

490
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,360
I don't know.

491
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Since when?

492
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
This kind of heavy fog started appearing.

493
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
They say this fog is an ominous sign.

494
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
They say there seems to be something hidden in this fog.

495
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Some people who went into the fog never came out.

496
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
Then those who came out became

497
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
became "crazy" or "eccentric,"

498
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know when it started

499
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,280
Then this kind of thick fog started to appear.

500
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,520
They say there seems to be something hidden in the fog.

501
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,920
Some people who went into the fog never came out.

502
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,200
Those who did come out became "crazy" or unstable.

503
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,040
This "corpse"

504
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
is definitely connected to the thick fog.

505
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,960
What should we do?

506
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,280
I need to report this to the higher-ups.

507
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Let them handle it.

508
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,680
Sorry about that.

509
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Sorry to interrupt your team-building activity.

510
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,840
So, can we get this for free this time?

511
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,960
Let's talk about that when we get back.

512
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,680
Everything can be discussed.

513
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,640
We're all a bit unusual.

514
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
Did you catch any fish?

515
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
There are some in here, right here.

516
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,400
Who would dare eat this fish?

517
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
We still have to cook?

518
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,520
Why don't you keep the fish and eat it?

519
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
It's been soaking together with that "corpse."

520
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,240
Who would eat this fish?

521
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
It's fine, the fish is still edible.

522
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,600
It's more humane.

523
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,400
It's more humane.

524
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
I'll stay here and handle it.

525
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,640
I'll report to the higher-ups.

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
Then you handle it, you handle it.

527
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,440
Don't tell anyone outside.

528
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,960
Otherwise, I won't be able to run my business.

529
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,640
Alright.

530
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,320
Hurry back and cook.

531
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,400
This reminds me of something called

532
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
the movie "Silent Hill."

533
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
Wait, let's analyze this a bit.

534
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,080
Can a living person sink in water?

535
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,640
Right.

536
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
No, they can't.

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,120
I think so.

538
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,680
He put stones in.

539
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,120
He was probably in a box.

540
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,840
There was a little girl inside.

541
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
She sank together with this doll.

542
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Then she "died" and no one knew.

543
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
In the end, it rotted away into "white bones."

544
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,920
That's all it is.
Yes.

545
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,200
There was fog when we went grocery shopping too.

546
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
Let's go.

547
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
Why is there so much fog?

548
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
So that market

549
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
is a space-time transfer point.

550
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Right.

551
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,440
The director just said

552
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,760
that things have been strange lately.

553
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,720
This fog keeps appearing.

554
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,560
And some people who go into the fog

555
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,440
never come back.
Or if they do come back,

556
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,320
they become "crazy," right?

557
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,520
Right.

558
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,960
So when our car went into the fog,

559
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,520
the car disappeared.
Right.

560
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
This fog might

561
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,520
be something that can

562
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,440
serve as a medium to travel between parallel worlds.

563
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
Yes, that's possible.

564
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,360
Hurry up and start cooking.

565
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Alright, coming.

566
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,520
Prepare your own ingredients first.

567
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,960
Okay.

568
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,640
We found a "body."

569
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,320
Unbelievable.
Acting as if nothing happened,

570
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,320
they started cooking here again.

571
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,800
People still have to eat, after all.

572
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,320
Do you like being given advice?

573
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,560
Depends on the person.

574
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
I can't stand it.
But you can.

575
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,160
We're just having shredded potatoes today.

576
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,320
Say no more.

577
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Guys,

578
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,920
Do you really know how?

579
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,600
I don't.

580
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
When was the last time you cooked?

581
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,720
About a year ago.

582
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,040
You're giving everyone emotional support in turns.

583
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Right here.

584
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,400
Of course, I'm just talking to you, right?

585
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
Are you jealous now?

586
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,480
Let me tell you,

587
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
Between these two, I choose this one.

588
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
This looks like a French fry.

589
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,480
Is that okay?

590
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,280
Isn't it a bit too thick?

591
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,960
Yes.

592
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,360
And the way you clumsily cut vegetables

593
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,800
makes me feel like I'm about to drool.

594
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,920
This is

595
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,200
No, my bro

596
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,680
Bro, what is this?

597
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,760
I cut this with Jin Jing

598
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,280
Why do it like this?

599
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,000
Sis
What's wrong?

600
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,280
They're laughing at us
Why do it this way?

601
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,720
Can you eat it like this?

602
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,480
Can't you eat it like this?

603
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I'm just eating this shredded potato today

604
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,720
Come on, bro, show us

605
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah, teach us

606
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,320
No, you can't cut it like this

607
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,440
Show us how

608
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
You should cut the strips longer

609
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,160
It has to be like this

610
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,640
First, make a base, then

611
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,560
If you marry, marry Liu Yuning

612
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
Yuning

613
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
He's really good

614
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,360
It's a bit speechless

615
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,920
Bai Yu

616
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
Makes you speechless

617
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,840
Reba

618
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,880
You're not bad either.

619
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,720
Okay.
You need to do it like this.

620
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,880
It's just an example.

621
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,440
First, have a base, then...

622
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
Alright, I'll imitate you.

623
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Isn't this too long?

624
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
I'll imitate him.

625
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,800
You're so smart.

626
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,360
You know what,

627
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,760
You really pick things up instantly.

628
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,720
You've improved so much.

629
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,080
You're pretty impressive.

630
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
You already caught a big fish.

631
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
This round was really amazing.

632
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,720
Wait a second, this...

633
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,120
Look at my little brother.

634
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,080
He only watched from the side for two minutes.

635
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,400
Before chatting with Liu Yuning

636
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
After chatting with Liu Yuning

637
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,840
You really can do it.

638
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,320
You can.

639
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
So smart.
Perfect.

640
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,120
Okay.

641
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,600
An easy shortcut for lazy people.

642
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,680
Why is this so messy?

643
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,080
Put it in the pot with cold water.

644
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,760
I find that having some hot soup

645
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,480
shouldn't be a problem.

646
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,600
It's very simple, just boil it.

647
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,880
You can't cut the shreds like this.

648
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
You can't do it this way.
Yeah, I noticed.

649
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Let me cut it for you.
Here, I'll cut it.

650
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,320
You're still the best, bro.

651
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
Bro, what do we mainly put in this mix?

652
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,240
Add a bit of light soy sauce.
Just add some salt.

653
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
Then add a bit of MSG.

654
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,920
Bro, for this tofu with scallions,

655
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,520
do we just mix it directly with the seasonings too?

656
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,960
Just salt and MSG are enough.

657
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,080
Should we add minced garlic too?

658
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,360
Sure, you can add some if you want.
Doesn't matter.

659
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,760
In here,

660
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,240
why is the chicken leg soaking all the time?

661
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,920
What for?
It's taking a bath.

662
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,440
Why do we need to soak it?

663
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,680
Because we need to soak it in cooking wine.

664
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,760
How about soaking it after cutting?

665
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,440
No need to cut.

666
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,560
Do we need to cut the chicken leg?
Chicken leg.

667
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,360
Then...

668
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Alright.

669
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,760
Hot pot base.

670
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,720
Ning.

671
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
Do you know how to caramelize sugar?

672
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,480
Let me tell you.

673
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,640
You don't have to make it so complicated.

674
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,120
Just dissolve it with water and it's fine.

675
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,200
Then just add the instant noodles or whatever.

676
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,680
Put them in and cook.
Then taste for saltiness.

677
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,400
If it's bland, add some salt.

678
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
If it's too salty, add more water.

679
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,960
Done.

680
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Now we wait.

681
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,360
Ning.

682
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,440
Do you know how to handle live fish?

683
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,680
I know how.
It's okay, let me do it.

684
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,480
Impressive, you really know what you're doing.

685
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
You're cleaning the fish.
Finished cleaning.

686
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,280
That's amazing.

687
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,640
Cooking wine.

688
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:00,960
Okay.
What's the next step after that?

689
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,560
Next, Zhang Linghe can do it.

690
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
You can add a bit more water.
Then just cook it a little longer.

691
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,720
Add some water.

692
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,840
Then you can use it as a kind of soup.

693
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,720
Sure.

694
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,880
Shredded potatoes need to be soaked first, right?

695
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,800
You can soak them, just to keep them from turning yellow.

696
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
So soak them in some water.

697
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,360
Then,

698
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400
Before you stir-fry,

699
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Blanch them in hot water first.

700
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,040
Like this.

701
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,280
Amazing

702
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,840
Today we're wearing these suits and shirts

703
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,320
and cooking here

704
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,840
Cooking here in suits and shirts

705
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,360
This outfit too.

706
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Why are you in there?

707
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,160
Little kitty.

708
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Whose voice is it

709
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
A bit hoarse

710
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,120
Yours

711
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,080
You know how to do it
You

712
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
You even have to show off your skills

713
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
You know how to cook.

714
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,720
A little bit.

715
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,880
I can handle simple dishes.

716
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,200
We can't eat takeout every day.

717
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,560
Your beef dish looks pretty decent too.

718
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,120
You followed his recipe, right?

719
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,160
Yes.

720
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,040
pickled chili

721
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
chopped chili sauce

722
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,720
so much

723
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
spicy

724
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm already drooling.

725
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,880
Yours is definitely delicious.

726
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,200
This sauce is perfect with rice.

727
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, it goes so well with rice.

728
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,720
This dish is complimentary.

729
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,200
One dish is free.

730
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,000
Smells so good.

731
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,120
Just serve it in the pot.

732
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,920
Don't put it in anything else.
Yeah, exactly.

733
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,440
Bring the pot over.
Bring the pot, come on.

734
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,640
Bowls and chopsticks.

735
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,240
Bro, serve yourself some rice.

736
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,880
It looks so fragrant.

737
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
Family.

738
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay.

739
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,480
It looks pretty good.
Tasty.

740
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Amazing.
Super fragrant.

741
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,960
This is incredible.

742
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,120
This is just too good.

743
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,280
How about we just help ourselves?

744
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Self-serve.

745
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,520
Try this fish, it's really good.

746
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,560
This fish is really tasty.

747
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,640
Yeah, it's delicious.

748
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
Here, try this double pepper beef.

749
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
This is delicious, goes great with rice.

750
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,760
Okay.

751
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
I'm not bragging, really.

752
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,360
No need.

753
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,960
It's really delicious.

754
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Thank you.
Okay.

755
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
The chicken soup is so fresh.

756
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
This chicken soup tastes really good.

757
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,400
There's chicken—who wants some?

758
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,280
This chicken is delicious.

759
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,920
This chicken looks amazing.

760
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,560
This is incredible.

761
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,400
Let me try your spicy and sour shredded potatoes.

762
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
It's super tasty.
Really?

763
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,480
It's good.
Right?

764
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,080
It really is good.

765
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,160
It really is.

766
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,680
Mainly, these shredded potatoes—

767
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,840
—they're not overcooked.

768
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,760
Yeah.

769
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
The spicy and sour shredded potatoes are really good.

770
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,680
The seasoning is great too.

771
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
It's really delicious.

772
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,000
I think every dish goes well with rice.

773
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Yeah.

774
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,120
Right?

775
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,800
Your cold appetizer is also pretty good.

776
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,640
Is it possible that we're just really hungry?

777
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,560
Why does everything taste so good?
I think so too.

778
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,520
Really.

779
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,760
It really is good.

780
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,000
Everyone must think we're just complimenting each other.

781
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,160
You know, hyping each other up.

782
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Yeah.
Like a business mutual praise.

783
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
We sat up front.

784
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,320
So delicious.

785
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
This chicken is so delicious.

786
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,360
I won't be an actor anymore.

787
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
Let's open a restaurant together.

788
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,120
Okay.

789
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,240
Not bad, but we'll definitely lose money.

790
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,200
Just those aprons, right?

791
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,480
We'll all go shirtless.

792
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,920
Wear aprons and stand in a row at the front.

793
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,760
Shirtless.

794
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,600
Grill steaks for them.

795
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,120
This place would definitely be a hit.

796
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,040
The two of us will handle the money.

797
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,360
That's great.
Sounds good.

798
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,160
If we open it together,

799
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,360
it would definitely be called Helimo.

800
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,600
Jin Yu.

801
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
That pause of yours was perfect.

802
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,480
Helimo.

803
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,360
That's when people are there.

804
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,440
When we grill steaks, it's called Helimo.

805
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,080
Okay.

806
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Next, we have a team-building mini-game.

807
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,520
Complete it and you'll get to see a surprise fireworks show.

808
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,080
Guess My Song.

809
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,720
Everyone, put on your headphones.

810
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,640
The first person's headphones

811
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,960
will play a melody.

812
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,920
They need to use the lyrics in front of them

813
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,560
to sing it out.

814
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,720
Then pass it to the next person.

815
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,680
The last person guesses the lyrics passed along.

816
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,800
And finally, guess the melody.

817
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,840
So they'll pass me

818
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,600
the correct melody

819
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,760
but with the wrong lyrics.

820
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
Right, just guess the song by the melody.

821
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,920
Let's do it.
Impressive.

822
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,720
Let me be number one.

823
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,480
Your turn is crucial.

824
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,360
Don't worry.

825
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,399
Okay.
Alright.

826
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
This turn is crucial.

827
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,200
Don't worry.

828
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,359
Beyond those mountains and that sea

829
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,040
there is a group of blue spirits

830
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,439
Beyond those mountains and that sea

831
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,000
there is a group of blue spirits

832
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,200
They are lively and smart

833
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,080
Isn't this "The Smurfs"?

834
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,879
Mischievous and clever

835
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,240
This is "The Smurfs"

836
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,080
Try it again.
Do it again.

837
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:16,879
One more time.

838
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,240
I don't know this song at all.

839
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,720
Try again, it's okay.

840
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,560
This is so hard.

841
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,640
What should I do?

842
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,160
What are you doing?

843
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,919
Listen to the melody.

844
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,200
I am listening to the melody.

845
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,480
Slower, can you go slower?

846
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,280
Okay.

847
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,560
One more time.

848
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,640
Beyond the mountains, beyond the sea,

849
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,360
there is a group of Smurfs.

850
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,960
They are lively and smart, they...

851
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,800
Why do you sing it differently every time, bro?

852
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,760
What do you mean?

853
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,320
Is it that hard?

854
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
It's fine, let's keep going.

855
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,240
They are lively and smart.

856
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,680
Darling,

857
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,120
in that mountain and that sea,

858
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,800
darling, I fell in love with you.

859
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,520
Since that day,

860
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,320
sweetness came so easily.

861
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,680
Sweetness came so easily.

862
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,520
Why do you sing it differently every time?

863
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,880
I really don't know what song this is.

864
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,760
Beyond the mountains

865
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,560
there is a group over there

866
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,760
of Smurfs, they're lively and smart.

867
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
They

868
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,080
No, the main thing is, who will switch with me?

869
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,000
Replace me as the first one.

870
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Switch.

871
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
Ning, you sit in the last spot.

872
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't think I can do well if I'm last.

873
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,600
No.

874
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,920
Because Ling He isn't moving.

875
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,440
No matter how we move, it doesn't help.

876
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,080
Unless we get Ling He out.

877
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,080
Then you...
I'll sit in the middle.

878
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,240
You take the middle spot.

879
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,240
Do you want to go first?

880
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,920
Then you guess.

881
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Wait a second.

882
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,920
If anyone among the six of us can sing this song,

883
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
then I lose.

884
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,600
Beyond those mountains, beyond that sea

885
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,480
there is a group of Smurfs.

886
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,240
They are lively and smart.

887
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,000
Alright.
Let me start from the beginning.

888
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
No rush.

889
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,400
Beyond those mountains

890
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
and beyond that sea

891
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,760
there is a group of Smurfs.

892
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,440
They are lively and smart.

893
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
I know.

894
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,280
That's definitely right.

895
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,920
Actually, you didn't sing it very well.

896
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
It wasn't easy for me to guess.

897
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,960
What I mean is,

898
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,200
because you...

899
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
Or maybe I guessed wrong.

900
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,000
Listen and see if what I sing is right.

901
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,240
Okay.

902
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,840
You are my little, little apple.

903
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,680
So impressive.

904
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,040
Little, little apple.

905
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,400
Just like the most beautiful flower on the horizon.

906
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,800
They are mischievous and clever.

907
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,360
Beyond those mountains and seas,

908
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,880
there is a group of blue spirits.

909
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,360
You are my little, little apple.

910
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,520
Got it?

911
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,280
You are always too soft-hearted, too soft-hearted.

912
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,360
Crying alone until dawn.

913
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,040
Yes, amazing.

914
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Then I guess I lost.

915
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,080
Amazing, but can't be more amazing anywhere else.

916
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,880
So fast.

917
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,040
So fast.

918
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,640
You are always too soft-hearted, too soft-hearted.

919
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,760
Crying alone until dawn.

920
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,160
I want to send you a never-setting sun

921
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,040
of longing

922
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,440
Really? Is that what it means?

923
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,320
What's wrong?

924
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,520
Do it again

925
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,000
You're always too soft-hearted, too soft-hearted

926
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,200
I want to send you a never-setting sun's longing

927
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,960
Send out a symbol of love

928
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:10,080
Send out a postcard representing love

929
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,640
That's enough
Is that okay?

930
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,800
Yes

931
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,040
He got about seventy percent of it right

932
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,720
That's fine

933
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,960
Send out a postcard representing love

934
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,240
Right

935
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay, go ahead

936
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,840
I want to send you my endless longing.

937
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Sending a postcard that represents my love.

938
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,960
Awesome.

939
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,080
This time, it's truly awesome.

940
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,320
Not bad.
Pretty good.

941
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Postcard.

942
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,440
Follow me

943
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,120
Done

944
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,200
Wait a moment

945
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,080
Wait a second.

946
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Follow my left hand, right hand, slow motion.

947
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,640
Slow motion.

948
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:30,240
Right hand, left hand, slow motion replay.

949
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,120
Replay.

950
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,480
It's over.

951
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,760
It's all ruined.

952
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,880
I really want to sing this song.

953
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,000
Wait a second.

954
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,320
What?

955
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,040
Do a slow motion with my left hand and right hand.

956
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,360
Right hand, left hand, slow motion replay.

957
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,240
Slow-motion replay.

958
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,760
Is this a folk song?

959
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,440
Yes.

960
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,320
A folk song?
Yes.

961
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,000
Replay it.

962
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,320
Okay.

963
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,320
By the way,

964
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,760
Can you still hear

965
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
the sound of the bayan accordion on Six Star Street?

966
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,520
Well...

967
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Can you still hear

968
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,760
the sound of the bayan accordion on Six Star Street?

969
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
At Alexander's bakery,

970
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,480
has the rye bread come out of the oven?

971
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,400
The first time
Do you know what he sang to me?

972
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,840
Beyond those mountains, beyond those seas

973
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
there is a Smurf

974
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,320
there is a group of Smurfs

975
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,960
He sang it just like the original, right?

976
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,200
The lyrics are from "The Smurfs"

977
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,520
I thought it was "The Peach Blossoms Bloom on the Mountain"

978
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,880
I sang this for him

979
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,920
Really?

980
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,640
I feel like I sang it correctly

981
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,320
Let me try once.
Your turn.

982
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,040
Beyond those mountains and beyond the sea,

983
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,160
there are Smurfs.

984
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,840
They are lively and smart,

985
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,080
mischievous and clever.

986
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,600
That's an improvement.
Right?

987
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,680
Yes, it's better.

988
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,840
I understand his pitch now.

989
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,240
His pitch is such that it

990
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,400
makes it hard for you to catch.

991
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,000
You can't guess what key he'll sing next.

992
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,320
What does he have?

993
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,440
After putting on these headphones,

994
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,160
they affect your...
They have an effect.

995
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,760
So you can't sing on pitch.

996
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,040
Congratulations on completing the challenge.

997
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,840
Now you can go outside and enjoy the fireworks.

998
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,960
Let's go watch the fireworks.

999
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
Let's go.

1000
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,560
We get to set them off ourselves.
They're right here.

1001
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,160
It's been a long time since I set off fireworks.

1002
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,400
I want to play with this kind.
Dancing fireworks.

1003
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,120
You have to hold two.

1004
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,000
So you can dance while waving them.

1005
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,480
Here it comes.

1006
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,280
Looks good.

1007
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,200
That one.

1008
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,680
This is pretty fun.

1009
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,760
This one looks really nice.

1010
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,040
So romantic.

1011
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Specks of starlight

1012
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,400
This one is so beautiful.

1013
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,360
So beautiful.

1014
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:55,960
Really good-looking.

1015
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
This looks really nice.

1016
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,360
So cool.

1017
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,440
Three, two, one.

1018
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,040
Ignite.

1019
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,120
Wait a second.

1020
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,360
Hold on.

1021
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,520
Light it.
It's fine.

1022
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,120
Wait for me.

1023
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,360
That
This is really cool

1024
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,520
This is so cool

1025
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,920
Helimo Jinyu

1026
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,840

"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

1029
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,040
We

1030
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,160
are here

1031
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,920
Look

1032
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:49,680
Someone's there

1033
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,680
That's so scary

1034
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,240
Someone's there

1035
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,560
Catch him!

1036
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,080
Hurry!

1037
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,480
Bai, go quickly! Hurry!

1038
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,680
Go quickly!

1039
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,920
Go catch him, hurry!

1040
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,440
Be careful, there's a flower bed here.

1041
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,280
Hurry, go catch him! Quick!

1042
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,600
Hurry!

1043
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,840
Did you catch him?
No.

1044
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,640
Didn't catch him.
What a pity.

1045
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,480
Didn't catch him.

1046
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,240
What a pity.
You're getting old.

1047
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,600
Alright.
Your blade has slowed.

1048
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,800
Alright, my blade has slowed.

1049
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,720
I should reflect on myself.

1050
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,360
Then next time,

1051
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,640
I definitely won't let him

1052
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,840
escape right under my nose.

1053
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,640
Well, um...

1054
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,320
There's an eye...

1055
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,120
What is this?

1056
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,120
The eyeball is moving.

1057
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,880
Eye.

1058
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,560
What does it mean?

1059
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,880
I am TYJ

1060
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,840
You can call me "Push Glasses"

1061
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,160
Push Glasses
TYJ

1062
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,920
Push Glasses

1063
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,080
There isn't much time left

1064
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,840
You need to finish the task as soon as possible

1065
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,680
What task?

1066
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,920
What?

1067
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,240
Why?

1068
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,520
What task?

1069
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,080
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

1070
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,920
Hey,

1071
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,200
something is flying over from that direction.

1072
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,600
What?

1073
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,240
A drone is flying over.

1074
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,320
There's something hanging underneath it.

1075
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,280
Is there something written on it?

1076
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,240
Push.

1077
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,280
Push your glasses up.

1078
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,360
It's an airdrop!

1079
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,880
Be careful.

1080
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,960
It should land over there.

1081
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,000
The airdrop has been released.

1082
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,440
Ever since the navigation failed,

1083
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,080
your mission has begun.

1084
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,680
All the unusual events today

1085
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,120
are related to your mission.

1086
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,040
I always feel

1087
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,520
this "creepy" place is hiding a lot of secrets.

1088
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,680
Even the dog's name has changed.

1089
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,800
And then the boss changed his name too.

1090
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,120
I'm the manager of this manor.

1091
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,600
My surname is Lin.

1092
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,640
You can just call me Old Lin.

1093
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,560
Okay, Brother Lin.

1094
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,680
I'm the manager here.

1095
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,960
Just call me Xiao Zhu.

1096
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,080
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

1097
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,840
Welcome, welcome.

1098
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,960
We've been here before.

1099
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,800
And then our car disappeared.

1100
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,520
The car is gone.

1101
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,360
Where's the car?

1102
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,320
Where's our car?

1103
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,000
What kind of car did you have?

1104
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,760
When we got out of the car,

1105
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,040
the phone kept acting weird.

1106
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,520
It switched by itself.

1107
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,640
It was like someone was controlling it from behind.

1108
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,280
Why is this phone moving on its own, bro?

1109
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:14,840
It must be controlled.

1110
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,080
Please reconfirm your destination.

1111
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,800
Someone's using it, someone's filming.

1112
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,040
Yeah, and there was smoke too.

1113
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,680
The main thing was that fog.

1114
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,160
Things haven't been peaceful here lately.

1115
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,480
I don't know when it started,

1116
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,840
but this thick fog keeps appearing.

1117
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,160
And then there's that "body".
What exactly is it?

1118
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,840
We still don't know.
Right.

1119
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,280
The little "body" in the box.

1120
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,120
And inside, there's a rag doll.

1121
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,080
There are clues in this box.

1122
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,160
Let's start deducing.

1123
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,360
Take a look, little brother.

1124
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,600
Take a look.

1125
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,920
Take a look.

1126
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,560
What is this?

1127
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,840
A "death" notice.

1128
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,480
Lao Mu.

1129
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,280
That's the man.

1130
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,400
That male boss.

1131
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,200
Lao Mu on such-and-such date...

1132
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,240
Unfortunately "passed away."

1133
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,520
All the dates are covered up.

1134
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,840
Are those cat paw prints?

1135
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,600
Aren't these dog paw prints?

1136
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,640
What does this mean?

1137
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,560
All the dates are covered up.

1138
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,640
Are those cat paw prints?

1139
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,240
That means one thing.

1140
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,560
He must have been holding this cat.

1141
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,960
It was at the crime scene.

1142
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,600
So his blood...

1143
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,680
got on the paw, and then it walked away.

1144
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,880
Should we look for this cat next?

1145
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,120
Yes.

1146
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,320
This black-and-white cat.

1147
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,920
Where is Cat Claw taking us?

1148
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
There's a cat bed in that one.

1149
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:08,920
Let's go.
Go

1150
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,000
Cat bed

1151
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,760
Cat bed

1152
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,160
Cat bed

1153
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,920
It's this one, right?

1154
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,320
Is it?

1155
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,720
Check if there's anything inside.

1156
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,880
Is there anything inside?

1157
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,560
No.

1158
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,120
Is this a cat bed?

1159
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,960
This should be a cat bed.
Isn't this cat litter?

1160
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,160
Yes.

1161
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,640
What is it?
Any clues?

1162
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,680
A cellphone.

1163
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,400
What?

1164
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,280
He texted his girlfriend saying

1165
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,440
I still remember

1166
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,000
the scene when we first met.

1167
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,840
You made me believe in love at first sight.

1168
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,240
Can't we get back together?

1169
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Then the girl said,

1170
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,280
Let's just forget it.

1171
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,800
Thank you for letting me love you.

1172
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,440
But the future you promised me

1173
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,480
was all a lie.

1174
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,560
What about love?

1175
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,720
I just made

1176
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,680
the mistake every man makes.

1177
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,240
What do I have to do to satisfy you?

1178
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,440
You don't deserve to have the right to love me.

1179
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,280
He'll give me a little more every day.

1180
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,720
Completely different from you.

1181
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,560
From now on, I won't be your friend.

1182
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,400
Friend.

1183
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,960
This says "girlfriend."

1184
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,600
That's strange.
I won't "act" as your friend.

1185
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,160
I won't "act."

1186
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,120
And "act" is a typo.

1187
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,240
Not "acting" as your friend.

1188
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,920
What's going on?

1189
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,800
What else can you see?

1190
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,240
Only this.
Only this screen.

1191
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,120
Start the push.

1192
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,640
Okay.
Please have a seat.

1193
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,960
So this should be Lao Mu's phone.

1194
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,600
Right?
Yes.

1195
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,120
Because this was in Lao Mu's...

1196
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,920
It was found in Lao Mu's house.

1197
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,120
I was going to ask, who is Lao Mu?

1198
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,600
It's the shop owner.

1199
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,080
Isn't he called Lao Lin?

1200
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,360
Yes.

1201
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,680
Wasn't he Boss Lin when we came?

1202
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,120
My surname is Lin.

1203
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,360
You can just call me Lao Lin.

1204
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,280
So that's Lao Lin.

1205
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,360
Half is missing.

1206
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,280
Is it possible

1207
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,360
that he's a person named Lao Lin,

1208
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,280
and then he split into two people,

1209
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,520
called Lao Mu No.1 and Lao Mu No.2?

1210
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,840
Together they're "Lin," separated they're "Mu."

1211
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,120
No.
Or is it possible

1212
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,960
that the person he mentioned is Lao Lin,

1213
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,040
and this person is Lao Mu?

1214
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,000
"Lin" has a bit more than "Mu."

1215
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,840
It has one more "Mu."

1216
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,960
But the person in this photo

1217
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,200
is clearly Lao Lin.

1218
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,760
Right.

1219
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,440
The names of these animals have all changed.

1220
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,280
Ba Di became Xiao Hei.

1221
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,560
That could be it.

1222
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,440
Just like the puppy,

1223
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,920
it also has two identities.

1224
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,200
Two spaces.

1225
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,440
No, look at this sentence.

1226
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,360
It's just that at the time, I made

1227
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,520
the mistake that all men make.

1228
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,240
He cheated, right?

1229
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,160
Not necessarily.
He didn't make it clear.

1230
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,760
"The mistake all men make"—

1231
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,840
what does he mean by that?

1232
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,560
Men make a lot of mistakes.

1233
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,320
Loving to poop.

1234
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,800
Is loving to poop a mistake too?

1235
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,480
How is that a mistake?

1236
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,400
Don't bring up your husband's

1237
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,720
habits here.

1238
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,160
Watch it again.

1239
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,040
I still remember to this day.

1240
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,000
The scene when we first met.

1241
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,640
You made me believe in love at first sight.

1242
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,840
The way they talk is a little strange.

1243
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,480
It is a bit strange.

1244
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,960
Doesn't it sound like song lyrics to you?

1245
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,720
Lyrics.

1246
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,240
It does sound like lyrics.

1247
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,960
Love at first sight.

1248
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,440
Eternity.

1249
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,640
Through countless cycles, love never fades.

1250
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,760
What's the name of this song?

1251
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,120
I think it's called "Love at First Sight."

1252
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:07,600
That's right.

1253
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,480
Is there something in common?

1254
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,520
Like in every sentence,

1255
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,760
there's actually a song title.

1256
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,320
For example, "A Glance for a Thousand Years".

1257
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,240
That's a song title.

1258
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,000
Right?
And then?

1259
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,280
But the future you promised me

1260
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,240
was all a lie.

1261
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,120
Which line here is a song title?

1262
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,400
"Far Away" seems like a song.
"Far Away" seems to be a song.

1263
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,240
S.H.E

1264
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,920
What about "Love"?

1265
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,240
It was just a mistake made at the time,

1266
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,720
a mistake all men make.

1267
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,880
I don't know.
Do you know?

1268
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,560
Do you know?

1269
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,120
I can tell.

1270
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,560
All men make that mistake.

1271
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,960
What kind of man are you?

1272
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,680
What kind of man?

1273
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,560
You just watched her leave and did nothing.

1274
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,880
That sounds great.

1275
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,920
You're really good at singing.
It's not important.

1276
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,360
Remember to come to my concert.

1277
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,520
I'll give you a ticket.

1278
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,480
What do I have to do to satisfy you?

1279
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,560
"Where's the Love" is just a song, right?

1280
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,600
Then they're all S.H.E's songs.

1281
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:11,960
Really?

1282
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,040
S.H.E
Yes.

1283
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,160
"Qualification to Love Me"
That's also S.H.E.

1284
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,520
S.H.E

1285
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,040
They're all her songs, all their songs.

1286
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,640
The same
group

1287
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,240
Right

1288
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,360
I got it
One possibility is

1289
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,760
they're using this so-called lyric awareness to communicate

1290
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,520
It's possible the two are exchanging secret codes

1291
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,840
They might not be talking about this

1292
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,240
Right, they might not be talking about this

1293
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,360
snake

1294
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,680
she

1295
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,160
shě

1296
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,600
shē

1297
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,720
shè

1298
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,600
shē shé shě shè

1299
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,320
shè

1300
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,040
shē shé shě shè

1301
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,600
snake

1302
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,680
shé, snake

1303
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,880
Right, where is the snake

1304
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,760
The one wearing the snake thing.

1305
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,640
The pattern on the front is a snake pattern.

1306
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,160
His pattern looks like a snake.

1307
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,680
So what is it?

1308
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,960
Is it some kind of organization related to snakes?

1309
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,320
Then let's go explore in a bit.

1310
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,960
Let's see inside this manor

1311
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,560
if there's anything related to snakes.

1312
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,600
Sure.

1313
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,200
Let's check out the snakes.

1314
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,360
Let's go.

1315
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,680
Snake.

1316
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,600
Let's go.

1317
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,760
Where to?

1318
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,160
Let's check out this platform.

1319
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,560
Isn't this it?

1320
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,200
Isn't this the color of the snake house?

1321
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:44,920
Harry Potter.

1322
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,800
What's up with you?

1323
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,040
Here.

1324
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,600
This is called an animal snake, see?

1325
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,320
Okay.

1326
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,800
Snakes have degenerated limbs.

1327
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,280
It's a general term for reptiles.

1328
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,120
When crawling,

1329
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,800
the snake's body

1330
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,520
forms horizontal wave-like bends on the ground,

1331
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,480
so the bends push against rough surfaces behind them,

1332
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,680
And so on.

1333
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,680
Who's crying?

1334
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,360
How do you know?

1335
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,560
Take one.
Come.

1336
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay.

1337
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,560
It's coming, the snake is coming!

1338
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,720
Bro, what if the snake comes?

1339
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,840
It's coming.

1340
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,040
Where?
The snake is coming!

1341
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,360
It's behind you.

1342
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:43,600
So annoying I could die.
Who are you?

1343
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,480
Why are you here?

1344
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,840
What are you doing here?

1345
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Xiao Zhu.

1346
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,640
You're not Xiao Zhu, are you?

1347
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,280
What's Xiao Zhu?

1348
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:52,840
Hello.
Who are you?

1349
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,520
I'm Lao Mu's younger sister.

1350
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,920
Lao Mu's younger sister?

1351
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,560
What's your name?

1352
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,720
My name is Xiao Mu.

1353
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,360
This place—

1354
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,160
is where my brother and I used to come often.

1355
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,280
After my brother left,

1356
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,160
I stayed here by myself.

1357
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,520
It's like he's still here with me.

1358
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,800
So what exactly are you doing here?

1359
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,720
You’ve already interrupted

1360
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,160
my conversation with my brother.

1361
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,240
You were just talking to your brother?

1362
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,560
Do you know where Lao Mu is?

1363
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,920
My brother has been gone for many years.

1364
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,480
Do you know how he passed away?

1365
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,280
I don’t know how he died.

1366
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,720
Are you here to investigate my brother’s “death”?

1367
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,000
Is that right?

1368
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,480
Yes, that’s right.

1369
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,960
The six of us may not look impressive,

1370
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,840
but actually, we are

1371
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,880
detectives.

1372
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,880
Famous detectives.

1373
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,360
We think there’s something suspicious about Lao Mu’s “death”.

1374
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,760
So we have to find out the truth.

1375
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,200
That’s right.

1376
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,600
So you came here

1377
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,640
for what exactly?

1378
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Did your brother like S.H.E’s songs?

1379
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,560
He was a die-hard fan.

1380
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,560
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

1381
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,800
Where is the snake?
Are you looking for the snake?

1382
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,080
That’s right.
Yes.

1383
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,520
I know where the snake is.

1384
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,800
Once you show us the clue, we'll leave.

1385
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,240
The snake is right there.

1386
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,520
It's exactly at that spot.

1387
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,240
Here.

1388
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,600
Under the lake?
Yes.

1389
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,160
You guys go look for it.

1390
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,440
I'll give you my flashlight.

1391
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,080
Okay, thank you.

1392
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,360
I'm going to keep chatting with my brother.

1393
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,920
Wait, what are you talking about with your brother?

1394
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,120
Their family matters

1395
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,040
Why do you know so much?

1396
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,880
Let's go

1397
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,680
Wait a second

1398
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,600
It's nothing

1399
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:19,880
Okay
You guys go

1400
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,280
Don't let him go last

1401
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,960
If I go last, I won't scare you

1402
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,240
I'm not that bored

1403
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
You're very boring

1404
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,240
She just said the snake is here

1405
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,200
A bit more to the left over there, more to the left

1406
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:52,800
What is this?
A necklace.

1407
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,000
Really?
Yes, really.

1408
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,600
There really is a necklace.

1409
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,080
What is it?
There's a string here.

1410
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,280
Wait, this string—

1411
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,920
Is this it?

1412
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,280
This seems to be the string.

1413
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,040
Could the snake be near the tree?

1414
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,240
Maybe it's in the grass.

1415
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,840
There's a hole here.

1416
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,280
Really.

1417
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,760
What's inside here?

1418
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:31,720
There's a snake.
There really is a snake.

1419
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:36,960
I don't dare to take it.

1420
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,200
It's a fake snake.

1421
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,640
There's a piece of paper.

1422
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:44,960
What's this?
A map.

1423
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,000
There's something on it.

1424
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,120
There's a place called Tui Tian.

1425
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,640
Food factory.

1426
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,960
This is another place.

1427
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,360
The snake is telling us.

1428
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,920
The truth is related to this.

1429
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,120
It's connected to Tui Tian Food Factory.

1430
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,320
If we want to uncover this secret,

1431
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,800
we have to explore different places.

1432
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,240
In here,
every location

1433
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,920
because some locations now

1434
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,680
still have their names covered by smoke.

1435
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,680
Yes.

1436
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,960
Right now, only one is revealed.

1437
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,960
It's Tui Tian Food Factory.

1438
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,280
Then let's go look for

1439
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,520
where Tui Tian Food Factory is.

1440
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:16,880
Okay?
That's right.
Alright.

1441
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:17,880
Let's go.

1442
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:43,840
What's going on?

1443
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,360
Did it explode?

1444
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,840
How did it explode?

1445
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,120
Oh no, there's something wrong with the smoke.

1446
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,440
What should we do next?

1447
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,680
Don't panic.

1448
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,280
Do you still remember who you are?

1449
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,720
I'm Bai Yu.

1450
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,640
I'm Dilraba.

1451
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,600
I'm Jin Jing.

1452
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,800
I'm Liu Yuning.

1453
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,840
I'm Zhang Linghe.

1454
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,640
I'm Zhou Keyu.

1455
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,520
Do you still remember your mission?

1456
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,120
I don't remember.

1457
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,000
Where are we?

1458
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,680
What are we supposed to do?

1459
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,080
Do we have a mission?

1460
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,160
Today, the six of you

1461
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,240
as the Helimo Jinyu Team

1462
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,640
are having a team-building day together.

1463
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,440
It's also the first day of your mission.

1464
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,360
Your mission

1465
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,040
is to find a very important person.

1466
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,560
This person is very dangerous.

1467
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,880
Is it the person we just saw?

1468
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,040
The person in black from earlier?

1469
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,360
It must have been just now.

1470
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,640
That man in black we didn't catch.

1471
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,760
It was him.

1472
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,360
The last place he appeared

1473
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,800
happened to be where you all had your team-building.

1474
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,760
This place.

1475
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,200
You came here to deal with him.

1476
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,040
To resolve the trouble he caused.

1477
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,680
But unexpectedly, he released the amnesia gas.

1478
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,240
Your mission failed.

1479
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,400
But it's okay.

1480
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,680
There's still a chance.

1481
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,400
Didn't you find

1482
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,000
other places related to him?

1483
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,840
He showed up in several other places.

1484
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,160
I can

1485
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,320
let you go to those places through rebirth.

1486
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,600
Go to those places.

1487
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,240
You must

1488
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,800
stop him.

1489
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,440
Welcome to

1490
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,680
Tuitian Confectionery Factory

1491
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,200
I just feel like something's off at our factory

1492
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,280
Something isn't right

1493
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:15,760
Someone was "killed"

1494
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,560
The boss
When he was lying here

1495
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,360
He wasn't "dead" yet

1496
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,640
He was "killed" by him

1497
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,920
I've been

1498
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,640
watching the boss's

1499
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,320
actions

1500
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,720
This boss probably isn't a good person

1501
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,600
Is that even a human
Or is it a "ghost"

1502
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,280
Or maybe a "zombie" or something

1503
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:29,600
Right

1504
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,400
Bai Hanzi
He ate our candy

1505
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,520
He had a nosebleed, and the blood turned green

1506
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,800
Tuitian Food Factory is a

1507
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,640
factory with no license, no standards, and no supervision

1508
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,080
They got what they deserved

1509
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,440
Another "death" has happened

1510
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,320
He just arrived yesterday

1511
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,000
He got electrocuted

1512
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,480
As soon as the sprinkler system turned on

1513
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:49,880
That's right
We were "killed" by the electricity

1514
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,360
He wants to punish us

1515
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,240
I don't know him
I don't know him either

1516
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,720
We're all the same

1517
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,120
It's the first time we've met him

1518
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,280
So that means

1519
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,320
He deserved to die

1520
01:05:59,160 --> 01:05:59,800
"Violence"
"Peeping"

1521
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,120
"Spreading rumors"
"Greed"

1522
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,200
"Incitement"

1523
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,520
There are so many people here

1524
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,120
The losers
"Die" here

1525
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,920
It's getting deeper and deeper

1526
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,520
Help
He wants to see us

1527
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,280
"Die" one by one
