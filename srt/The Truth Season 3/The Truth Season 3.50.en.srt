1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,800
An Wenzhe

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
committed suicide.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,840
That person just now

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,880
was resurrected from a corpse, just like the four of you.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,400
In other words,

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,240
we are actually not who we are now.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,520
We are someone else.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Actually, you and he are the real pair.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,800
Ba and He are a pair.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,560
I actually entered the wrong body.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,600
The daughter from yesterday was He Sheshe.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
He Niba, the daughter of Ba She.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,880
So you are all snake demons.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,600
She is the eldest among the four of you.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Among the four of you,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
one person regained their memory

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,400
and killed your eldest brother.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,640
His movements

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,160
were exactly the same as the deceased.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,600
He used a puppet-like method

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
to control another person.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
So he used a puppet-like method

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,760
to control another person.

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,240
What time did we come back?

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,800
We returned to the mansion at six o'clock.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,080
When we came back,

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
he was doing this exact thing.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,320
She

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,880
But we were together at six o'clock.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,120
And the person in the video acted alone.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,440
Then it has nothing to do with us.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,320
So the four of us are innocent.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,400
If he wanted to do this,

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,760
he must have used someone else to do it.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,199
It's the man with the limp who's doing this.

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,680
Because we were together at that time.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
He couldn't have done it.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,600
Then why would the man with the limp do this?

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,680
Did he use some kind of method?

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
We just don't know right now.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
Maybe among the six of us,

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,680
someone instructed him.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
I think this method makes sense.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
That's probably it.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
Hurry up, why would I lie to you?

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,360
Come on.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Welcome.

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
Come, open the door.

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,280
Come in.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,040
Hello, everyone.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,520
Hello.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,840
I'd like to ask you two something.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,320
Why does your leg seem to have trouble?

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
How did it happen?

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,760
You go ahead and tell this embarrassing story.

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Just a couple of days ago,

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,000
his business was doing really well.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
So I thought,

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,520
my doll shop is so nice,

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
but no one comes.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,040
So I went over.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
Then I went over and said to him,

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
Hey, man,

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
why not check out my doll shop?

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,320
But he,

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,680
gave me a flying kick and knocked me down.

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,920
But I'm a man,

68
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,560
I wouldn't back down.

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
So I kicked back.

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
I knocked him down too.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,160
That's what happened.

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
So you two hurt yourselves fighting each other?

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Yes.

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,200
He hurt his left foot, right?

75
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
We both kicked each other's right foot.

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
I kicked his right leg.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
His right leg is injured too, right?

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Everyone, may I ask something?

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
I don't know why you called me here.

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
He dragged me here too.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,400
Because we want to take over your shop.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
We might buy it at a high price later.

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,680
That's right.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
Because we're from the Good family.

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,800
We're very wealthy.

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm sure you can tell.

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,080
Alright.

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
And you all are models.

89
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,840
That's right.

90
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
We're all male models.

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Transfer him two hundred later.

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,040
You go transfer two hundred first.

93
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Yes, but answer our questions first.

94
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay.

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Alright.

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,080
At six o'clock this morning,

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,800
what were you two doing?

98
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,400
Let me go back a bit.

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,240
Last night, because

100
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
I was absorbed in my designs,

101
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,200
I worked late into the night.

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,240
So I slept in the shop.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Then the next morning

104
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,760
I got up at five to open the door

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
After opening the door, it was 5:44

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I heard a loud commotion in the village

107
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
It sounded very lively

108
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
So I ran over to take a look

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Actually, I ran into him at the ceremony

110
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,519
Yes

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
You two met in the morning

112
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,600
At six o'clock, I started

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,920
Because the ceremony was over

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,080
I hurried back

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,800
And stayed in the shop the whole time

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
Can you draw?

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
In terms of clothing design

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Anyway, I can handle all of it

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,000
You can use a brush, right?

121
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,200
I don't use a brush to draw clothes

122
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,280
I've never used tools like that either

123
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,920
What about you?

124
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,360
And you?

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,920
Add one

126
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Add one

127
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,440
Here, let me show you a video

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Has anyone worn this piece of clothing?

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,640
This dark blue long robe?

131
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,280
Who is this?

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Do you recognize them?

133
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
One of you

134
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,480
looks a bit guilty.

135
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
The person on the left,

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
we all have this piece of clothing.

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,880
You have it, right?

138
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,520
Yes, I do.

139
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,400
But just now, your guilty reaction

140
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
was a bit too obvious.

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
So it’s you, isn’t it?

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
My business

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,360
still has things that need to be done.

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
I still need to go back and watch the shop.

145
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,080
Everyone,

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
if there’s no intention to cooperate,

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,000
then

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,520
no.

149
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,640
We’re here to invest in this shop.

150
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
Who is this person?

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
We’ll just buy his shop.

152
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,120
We need to do a background check.

153
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
Understood.

154
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,440
You are...

155
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
Okay, you seem very positive and upbeat.

156
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
You can go back first.

157
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,040
I think he’s suspicious.

158
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Catch him.

159
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,640
Catch him.

160
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,400
Actually, a lot of people have this clothing.

161
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,560
Right, we all have this clothing.

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,600
But this way of walking,

163
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
only you two have it.

164
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,160
There’s definitely something wrong with his big toe.

165
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Your left foot—why is your left foot injured?

166
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
I told you,

167
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,760
it’s been this color since I was a child.

168
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
It’s different from other places.

169
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,760
It’s obvious this was just bumped.

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,240
Apply the torture.

171
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm here.

172
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm here.

173
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,320
I am the most brutal punishment here.

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,920
Don't push me.

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,040
Be honest.

176
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm really here.

177
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,160
Come on, hit his hands.

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
Don't do this.

179
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
I won't say anything.

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,040
His accent changed.

181
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
Hold him back.

182
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't think you'll get the truth from me.

183
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Scan two hundred, come on, scan two hundred.

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Is that okay?

185
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Scan two hundred.

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,960
Can you talk for two hundred?

187
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,920
You believe me now, right?

188
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Then I'll head back first.

189
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,080
You go ahead.

190
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,480
Goodbye.

191
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,840
Yes.

192
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,360
I remember now.

193
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,880
Go ahead.

194
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
There are security cameras in my shop.

195
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,880
His shop is right across from mine.

196
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
It should have captured something.

197
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,560
Okay.

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,160
After you find it, the surveillance footage—

199
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,680
In his pocket—

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Bring it to us, okay?

201
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Okay, I'll come right over.

202
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
Alright.

203
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,760
Messenger of justice.

204
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,720
Here's the situation.

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,240
Yes.

206
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Now, here's the decision.

207
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
We have to take his things by force.

208
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
We can definitely get them.

209
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,680
But should we do this?

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,400
But should we really do this?

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,080
Let's not do this.

212
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,600
Why?

213
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Let's use this to hypnotize him.

214
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Right.

215
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,720
Blank.

216
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,640
You did it wrong.

217
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
You did it wrong.

218
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Do it like this. Blank.

219
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Blank.

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
Blank.

221
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
You can do everything.

222
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
You can do everything.

223
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,160
You handle him.

224
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
You do it.

225
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,320
Charm him.

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,880
Use the black mamba pose.

227
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
Cobra, is that okay?

228
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,960
It doesn't seem to work.

229
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,039
Here's the thing, man.

230
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,720
It's okay, relax.

231
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,480
Come on, have a seat first.

232
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,760
Your feet are uncomfortable, sit down first. Right.

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Why are you making him stand like he's being punished?

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,200
Sit down first.

235
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,320
Alright, let's use a cruel punishment.

236
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,400
You sing.

237
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
"Two Butterflies."

238
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Darling, fly slowly.

239
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead.

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
Darling, fly slowly.

241
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Watch out ahead.

242
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Master, stop reciting.

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
Otherwise, he’ll be even less willing to talk.

244
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
Is there something you can’t talk about?

245
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Yes.

246
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,960
I told you,

247
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
you won’t get the truth from me.

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Then take it.

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,840
I advise you not to resist too hard.

250
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
Because you’ll get hurt.

251
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,840
Because the four of us look like

252
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,760
martial arts masters from different schools, right?

253
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
I’ll just get hurt, but you’ll lose your life.

254
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,360
This call.

255
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,880
There’s some kind of ointment here.

256
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
A ring.

257
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,040
It’s him.

258
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,640
The phone.

259
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
Someone this morning—

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
At 5:30 in the morning,

261
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,960
someone called him.

262
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,400
At 5:35.

263
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Then let’s call back.

264
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
See whose phone rings.

265
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,880
Try calling.

266
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,240
Why not just ask him? He’s right here.

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
He said he absolutely won’t say anything.

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
He won’t cooperate at all.

269
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
He’s already entered

270
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,040
AI mode.

271
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,880
Listen.

272
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,680
In the yard.

273
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,640
No.

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,200
Over there.

275
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
Over here.

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,360
Over here.

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Keep an eye on him for me.

278
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,080
No problem.

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
The old master's room.

280
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
This phone was here.

281
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
It's here.

282
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,520
Take a look at it.

283
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,120
Let me take a look.

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
This is Tui Taiye's phone.

285
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,760
Let's go back first.

286
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Let's go back.

287
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,560
Who knocked this over?

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
Could it be his toe...

289
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
...hit it while walking here?

290
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,640
He kicked this.

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,000
Right.

292
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
That's it.

293
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,480
This is the place shown in the video.

294
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,400
Got it.

295
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
His left foot hit that, it hurt a lot.

296
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,360
But there was no time to help him up.

297
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,600
Because it's almost six o'clock for him.

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
Go and mimic that person's movements.

299
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
The video just now was shot

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,840
right from here.

301
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,440
Yes.

302
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
This was the camera angle just now.

303
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
The robot vacuum was right behind me.

304
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,960
And I was that person.

305
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
I did it like this.

306
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,360
Then

307
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,560
Yeah.

308
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,720
Then the robot vacuum

309
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
also happened to hit this obstacle.

310
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,480
Then I just kept walking.

311
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,520
And it looked exactly like what was filmed.

312
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,200
That door, then take it out here.

313
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,320
Then do this,

314
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,440
then with the left hand,

315
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,120
the ring in the left pocket fell out with a snap.

316
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,800
And that's the end.

317
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
Where are you going?

318
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
What are you doing?

319
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,360
I just want to go back and do business.

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,080
Sit for a while. Wait until they arrive before you leave.

321
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
Sit down. You can't leave.

322
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
You really can't leave.

323
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,480
If I let you get away,

324
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
I'll look way too suspicious. No way.

325
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,000
Hurry up, you guys.

326
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
I can't control it anymore.

327
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,760
He's tried to run out dozens of times.

328
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,280
We already found out just now.

329
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,680
We already figured it out just now.

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
This foot of yours—

331
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,000
You came to our place this morning,

332
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,120
and you knocked over one of our vases.

333
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,280
If you don't tell the truth,

334
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
you'll definitely have to pay for the vase.

335
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
Because that's a very valuable item.

336
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,280
If you confess honestly,

337
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
we'll let bygones be bygones.

338
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,480
The vase didn't break.

339
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,280
The vase didn't break.

340
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,040
It broke.

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,200
We'll just frame him and say it broke.

342
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,520
It broke.

343
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
Right in front of everyone.

344
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,640
Go ahead, say it.

345
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,440
What exactly happened?

346
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,280
Speak.

347
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,440
So you bought my clothes this morning,

348
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
then refunded the money,

349
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
and returned the clothes as well.

350
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,200
What were you really up to?

351
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,920
Are we bad people,

352
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
doing things like this?

353
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,240
This morning,

354
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
let me tell everyone a story.

355
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
I went with him

356
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,960
to a shop to buy clothes.

357
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,480
Then I said I'd scan the code.

358
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,360
As soon as I scanned, it beeped.

359
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,920
But I didn't pay.

360
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,960
The two of us just left.

361
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
It really wasn't on purpose.

362
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,640
I actually forgot my password at that moment.

363
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,720
But I was in a hurry to help you guys.

364
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
After helping you,

365
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,120
I felt like the clothes

366
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,920
didn't really fit.

367
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,480
So I returned them.

368
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Anyway, I hadn't paid.

369
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,880
This really was our fault.

370
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,120
We apologize to you.

371
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,120
We apologize.

372
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
Are you holding a grudge?

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,160
It's fine, I won't say anything.

374
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,800
I won't say anything.

375
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,000
Wait, there are two rings here.

376
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Because on that body

377
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
there was also a ring.

378
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,320
Isn't there one here too?

379
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,200
Whoever wears this ring will synchronize with him.

380
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
Let me try, I don't believe it.

381
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,400
I don't believe it either.

382
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
You try it on, come on.

383
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,040
Too "stupid".

384
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,760
We're too "stupid".

385
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,280
What if this line is connected to that line?

386
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,760
Then we could move in sync like this.

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Or, to make it even more mysterious,

388
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,000
this thing is just a

389
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
trigger for mimicking actions.

390
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,680
I think it's possible.

391
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,760
Its snake symbols come in different sizes.

392
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,760
The big snake controls the small snake.

393
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Right.

394
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
But when you two just wore it,

395
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,080
you weren't in sync either.

396
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,040
Try again.

397
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,880
How could it not work?

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
Do you need to read this out loud after trying?

399
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,120
This.

400
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,320
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

401
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,400
One is on the body of the dead.

402
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,680
Right.

403
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,480
One is on

404
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,240
his body.

405
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,040
Could it be that it only controls corpses?

406
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,320
It's possible.

407
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Yes, that's right.

408
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,760
Come on.

409
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,920
Then the two of us will go out to check that.

410
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
Two people stay here to watch him.

411
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,320
Actually, we don't need him.

412
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,360
Don't need him.

413
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,200
Anyone can wear it.

414
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,200
Then let's all go together.

415
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
We don't need him then.

416
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
If you go together, he won't leave.

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,120
He really tried to run just now.

418
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,240
He tried to run several times just now.

419
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,360
Wait, I'll cast a spell on him.

420
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Freeze.

421
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,200
Here, let me put it on.

422
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,440
It's from the Snake Tribe.

423
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,240
It's on.

424
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
I am from the Snake Tribe.

425
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,720
Stand up.

426
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay, it's set.

427
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
Watching this gives me the creeps.

428
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,520
You're so bad.

429
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,000
Alright, it's fine.

430
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,840
Did you put it on?

431
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
I did.

432
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
This thing indicates something.

433
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,200
The deceased didn't

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
die at six o'clock.

435
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,440
That's right.

436
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,400
He didn't die in front of us.

437
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,320
He died a long time ago.

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,160
During this time, someone

439
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,000
pretended to pass by in front of us.

440
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Exactly.

441
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,440
Smart.

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,280
Okay.

443
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,480
You're no longer a suspect.

444
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,760
I believe you.

445
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,320
Let me tell you.

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,000
Before I came here just now,

447
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
I had already thought of this.

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Really? Then why didn't you say so?

449
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Stop moving so much.

450
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,280
Because we have to take it step by step.

451
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,800
You know?

452
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,880
I don't believe you. Explain more.

453
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
It's a very simple matter.

454
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,240
Hit him.

455
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,680
Because of this,

456
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,320
if it can be controlled,

457
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
Come a bit closer.

458
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,720
If it can, let me tell you,

459
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,600
If

460
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,120
if the corpse can be manipulated,

461
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,120
Come back, let me tell you.

462
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,640
If—come here.

463
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,920
Come here.

464
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,160
If it can,

465
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
He suddenly took control of me.

466
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
This can be controlled by each other.

467
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,560
Yeah, he suddenly controlled me.

468
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,800
Put it in your pocket.

469
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,320
Okay.

470
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,200
Alright, let's head back first.

471
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Let's go.

472
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Someone's here.

473
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Come quickly.

474
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,200
Coming.

475
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,440
Look.

476
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,600
This guy ran off.

477
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm back.

478
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,360
I brought this.

479
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,760
Surveillance footage.

480
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,000
Alright, thank you. Thank you.

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,280
Thank you.

482
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:02,960
No problem.

483
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,240
Thanks.

484
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,040
I'll let you get back to it.

485
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,360
Okay.

486
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,000
Go ahead, goodbye.

487
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,920
Goodbye.

488
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,880
Surveillance footage, here.

489
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Do you want to see it? Come on, hurry.

490
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Sleeping here.

491
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,240
Come, number thirty-five is here.

492
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,440
He answered the phone.

493
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,200
He answered the phone.

494
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Number thirty-five took a call.

495
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Someone instructed him.

496
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
To come and do this.

497
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,600
Right.

498
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,520
At this point, he was already dead.

499
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
So you're saying this is the killer.

500
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
It was after the murder.

501
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,560
The murder had already happened.

502
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,360
He definitely put him there after killing him.

503
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
He just manipulated the body.

504
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
This can be confirmed.

505
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
He did this consciously.

506
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,960
That’s possible.

507
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,920
And the reason he could do this is because

508
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,120
of what the person on the phone said.

509
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
He was willing to do it.

510
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Right.

511
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
It must be someone he trusts.

512
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Yes.

513
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,640
Model 8364 robot vacuum

514
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
has finished charging.

515
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,920
Today's cleaning route

516
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,280
Please check on the control room computer.

517
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,720
Control room.

518
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,080
Eight three six four.

519
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
Server room location map

520
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,200
Please check the cleaning robot's backend in the server room

521
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,040
Tear it off

522
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,840
Here, tear it off

523
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,400
The server room is here

524
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,680
Go to the cleaning robot

525
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,840
Take a look at the server room backend

526
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,360
Let's go

527
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,560
It's that one, right?

528
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,240
Server room

529
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,640
This room

530
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,200
This one

531
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,640
Why is there another robot standing there?

532
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,800
What did you say?

533
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,520
It needs to be reset before it can rest

534
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,880
Then reset it for him

535
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,600
You can only rest after restoring it.

536
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,280
He won't let me in.

537
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Let's go out first.

538
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,640
There are guard robots stationed in the server room.

539
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,720
Except for pushing it outside.

540
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,760
If any life signs are detected,

541
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
an alarm will be triggered immediately.

542
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,200
And all data will be locked.

543
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,160
If you need to access the server room's back-end computer,

544
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,120
you must first disable the guard robots.

545
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,800
How to disable them:

546
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Complete the puzzle to disable the guard robots.

547
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
People with life signs can't enter.

548
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,120
So we need to control She to come here.

549
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,000
This is fun.

550
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
Wait, then how do we get She to come over first?

551
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
You two take the ring and go over first.

552
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,480
Then put it on there and walk with him.

553
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,280
Bring him over, right?

554
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,800
Right.

555
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,360
I have the ring.

556
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
I'll bring him over.

557
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
You guys wait here for me.

558
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,440
Okay.

559
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
You're not going with him?

560
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,880
Why should I go with him?

561
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,960
What if he's X?

562
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
He is X.

563
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
Now I have to choose between the two of them.

564
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
Have you ever won when you bet on me?

565
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,120
Alright, let's go.

566
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,440
Here he comes.

567
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
Hello, everyone.

568
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,480
Hello.

569
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
Alright, let's go.

570
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,600
Step over.

571
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,040
You need to go to the next room.

572
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
That's what it means.

573
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,080
Take it off first and put it in your pocket.

574
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,880
It's fine, turn like this, turn right.

575
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,640
If I walk forward, won't he get stuck here?

576
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,480
Then he's glitched.

577
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Go straight.

578
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Stop.

579
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
Turn right, then reach out your hand to grab it.

580
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Okay, got it.

581
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,800
Pull it down, pull it down.

582
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,000
Pull harder.

583
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,760
Pull with force.

584
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,600
That's right.

585
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:42,960
Okay.

586
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Move forward.

587
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,840
Stop.

588
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
Stick this board onto the wall.

589
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,800
Put it in the frame.

590
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,400
That's right.

591
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,520
Okay.

592
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,880
Move your hand down slowly.

593
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,280
Move a little more to the left.

594
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,960
Both hands at the same time.

595
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,200
Okay.

596
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,880
Forward.

597
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,560
Pick up this board.

598
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
Step to the left.

599
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,680
Okay.

600
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
Stick it on the wall.

601
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,560
Okay.

602
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,600
Take the one in front of you.

603
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,880
This train ticket.

604
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,960
This train or plane ticket sticker.

605
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
Move it to the left.

606
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
Lower your hand a little.

607
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,160
Move it forward.

608
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes, move to the right.

609
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Take another step to the right.

610
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,520
Raise your hand.

611
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Stick it in.

612
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,280
Very good.

613
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,760
Perfect.

614
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
Take off your ring.

615
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,880
The ring.

616
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,600
The ring is off.

617
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,400
It's off.

618
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
It's off, the ring is off.

619
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,080
Okay, let him go out.

620
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,520
Let him go out.

621
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,080
Let him go out.

622
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,040
Three, two, one.

623
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,520
Put it on.

624
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,680
Go.

625
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,960
Let him sit for a while.

626
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Okay.

627
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
Backstage computer storage.

628
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,080
Found it.

629
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,160
Take it back.

630
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,640
Take it back.

631
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,760
Go

632
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,960
As expected

633
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,080
The correct way is to find

634
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
the Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

635
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,400
Turns out you can book hotels, homestays, flights, and train tickets

636
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes

637
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,680
This push is so wild, hiding his beloved wife at home

638
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
It's also a last resort

639
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,920
If possible

640
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,880
he would definitely want to use Tongcheng Travel to book tickets and go out

641
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,960
I hope everyone

642
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
won't be bound by reality either

643
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,880
Quickly open WeChat

644
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,760
Go to "Me"

645
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
Find and use "Services"

646
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,920
Super affordable and convenient Tongcheng Travel booking

647
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,000
Pursue freedom

648
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,720
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

649
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,560
Let's set off together with Tongcheng

650
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,560
Take a look at that surveillance footage.

651
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,240
Let's check the computer in the equipment room.

652
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,360
AI video analysis.

653
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,200
What does that mean?

654
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,800
It can recognize video, audio, and analyze lip movements.

655
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Upload the video you want to analyze.

656
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,160
What about the video on the phone?

657
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,080
Try uploading it here.

658
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
Let's analyze it.

659
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,760
Why did he sing this song?

660
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,800
It's pointing to me again.

661
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
No, maybe this can clear you.

662
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
I think that's possible.

663
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,040
Yeah.

664
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,160
So it might rule you out.

665
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,880
At that time, in your mind,

666
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,280
you really were missing Batefulai.

667
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,240
Then you would be cleared of suspicion.

668
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,600
Do we need to tell it which part to analyze?

669
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
No need, the AI will analyze everything.

670
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
It will analyze everything for you.

671
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,080
You, all day long...

672
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,200
Don't try to muddy the waters.

673
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,040
Wait a second.

674
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,320
Are we analyzing

675
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,680
when he made or received a call?

676
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,840
With the person on the other end of the call,

677
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
what lip movements did he make?

678
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,160
Right.

679
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,480
Yeah, we got it wrong.

680
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,120
No, what lip movements did he use while on the call?

681
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,200
Making a call.

682
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
He answered a call at 5:35.

683
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
At 5:35,

684
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
what was said on the call?

685
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:56,960
He's coming.

686
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
The 5:35 alarm.

687
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
Lip-reading recognition.

688
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,960
Hello.

689
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,080
You finally called me.

690
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,880
After I helped you escape back then,

691
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,280
I was afraid of being found out.

692
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,640
I didn't dare contact you on my own.

693
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,040
What?

694
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
You lost your memory and just got it back?

695
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,720
You want to talk to him.

696
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,240
Recovered.

697
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,800
What?

698
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,080
Your conversation went badly.

699
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
You accidentally killed him.

700
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,920
You're about to go out.

701
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
No time to deal with the body.

702
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
Don't worry.

703
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
None of them know I'm your subordinate.

704
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
I can use

705
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
the paired rings to help you.

706
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,280
Right.

707
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,000
The paired rings are "She".

708
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,560
They were just made recently.

709
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,200
They're used to control corpses.

710
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
I have to attend the ceremony.

711
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,880
After the ceremony, I'll rush over.

712
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,240
I'll put the sub-ring on the body right away.

713
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,680
As long as I wear the main ring,

714
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,320
I can control him instantly.

715
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,920
Make him leave.

716
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
Your room.

717
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,800
Make it look like he committed suicide in front of everyone.

718
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,960
That way, it won't be linked to anyone.

719
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,240
Understood.

720
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

721
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,920
Two important pieces of information.

722
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,520
One is regaining memory.

723
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Then talking to him.

724
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,040
He must have had some unresolved issues with him before.

725
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,800
One of us

726
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,880
regained their memory early

727
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
and went to see Big Brother ahead of time.

728
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
Why did he regain his memory?

729
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,600
What did he talk about with Big Brother?

730
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,160
The last message in the group

731
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,640
"If you don't stop this,"

732
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
"we won't be family anymore."

733
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,080
Big Brother said, "What do you know?"

734
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,200
Crash, bang

735
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
Right, didn't this person regain their memory?

736
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,800
So he went to talk to Big Brother about it.

737
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,640
After regaining his memory,

738
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,280
he wanted to continue arguing with him.

739
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,600
But halfway through, the argument got out of hand.

740
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,800
He accidentally killed him.

741
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,400
Let's go over this sheet.

742
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,040
Okay.

743
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,480
The clothing store owner just said

744
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,600
You finally called me.

745
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,960
He helped you escape back then.

746
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,080
That means at that time,

747
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,520
he helped all four of you escape.

748
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,840
All four of you know him.

749
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,080
Yes.

750
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,360
That's right.

751
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,600
Yes, that's a key point.

752
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,560
What? Your conversation fell apart?

753
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,360
You accidentally killed him.

754
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,600
Yes.

755
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes.

756
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,840
By accident.

757
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,640
When this person helped you escape back then,

758
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
he was your subordinate.

759
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,400
Because of this master-slave ring,

760
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,160
She just made it.

761
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
It's used to control corpses.

762
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
He said he had to attend the ceremony first.

763
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,600
After the ceremony, he rushed back.

764
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Then he immediately put the slave ring on the corpse.

765
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,560
And got him out of your room.

766
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,040
Yes.

767
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Made it look like he committed suicide in front of everyone.

768
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
So the next step

769
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,200
is to check where he died.

770
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
The room.

771
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,640
Which room?

772
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
See whose room it is.

773
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
Which room did you sleep in last night?

774
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,720
The butler's room.

775
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,600
I slept in the old master's room.

776
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Ba, which room did you sleep in?

777
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,040
At 2:30,

778
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,440
I arrived at the old lady's room.

779
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,320
I saw the moon.

780
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,360
No, otherwise lining up would have been for nothing.

781
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Yeah, we lined up.

782
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,720
Because he slept in the garbage dump yesterday.

783
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,080
Yeah.

784
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,720
Seriously, you went back to the garbage dump to sleep yesterday?

785
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,240
Yeah.

786
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
Then you lined up today.

787
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,120
Yeah.

788
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,640
It's the three of us.

789
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,120
We helped each other get dressed, right?

790
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,240
You, me, and him.

791
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,360
I can't line up.

792
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,840
I went back to my young master's room.

793
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,120
Can you say something honest?

794
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,360
He said it.

795
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,240
He said it.

796
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
Why are you lining him up?

797
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
I'm not joking.

798
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
I'm just kidding, that's all.

799
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,800
Let's go search the rooms.

800
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Let's search all four rooms.

801
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,600
Yeah, let's go.

802
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,280
Next, let's search

803
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,760
the places where everyone slept last night.

804
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,920
See if there are any clues.

805
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,120
Let's start with this one.

806
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
The old master's room.

807
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
Her carpet is red.

808
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
Even if there was blood, you wouldn't see it.

809
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,200
If you want to suspect me as the culprit,

810
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,040
there's no need to rush.

811
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,680
Guys, do you want to check my room?

812
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,360
Sure.

813
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's go.

814
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,440
It's so cool in here.

815
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,280
What's in here?

816
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,200
Look.

817
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
This room doesn't have a carpet.

818
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Go and help me lift up all the carpets.

819
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,520
See if there's any crucial evidence.

820
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:08,920
No.

821
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,360
I can't stand being falsely accused like this.

822
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,240
I want to check

823
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
the real culprit's room.

824
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,600
Please come in.

825
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
Welcome to my home.

826
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,280
My room has a green carpet.

827
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,400
Stop talking.

828
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm about to look for crucial evidence.

829
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,920
Let's go.

830
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,680
Ba's room.

831
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,800
X.

832
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,600
It's good that you admitted it.

833
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,840
Let's split up.

834
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,320
You must come find me.

835
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,360
Okay, when the time comes.

836
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll come find you singing "Two Butterflies."

837
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,560
Do you still remember how to sing it?

838
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Darling, fly slowly.

839
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,560
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead.

840
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,040
So it's

841
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,240
This is from yesterday, right?

842
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Yes.

843
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,320
This is all from yesterday.

844
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,920
This is

845
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,720
the place where Ba slept yesterday.

846
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,200
I didn't sleep.

847
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,680
I didn't sleep.

848
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,960
At two thirty,

849
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,760
I came to this room to meet with Moon.

850
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,000
Then she talked to me.

851
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,520
She said she was my real younger sister.

852
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,360
She said the same thing again.

853
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,440
And then you remembered you were originally a snake person.

854
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
No, I didn't remember.

855
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,840
I don't know anything.

856
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,720
I'm not familiar with this either.

857
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Then I saw her leave.

858
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
She said she was going out to take care of some things.

859
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
She told me not to go outside.

860
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
Because it's dangerous outside.

861
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,040
Then I saw

862
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,240
on some table, I don't know which one,

863
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,800
there was a flyer for the parade.

864
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,120
And those clothes.

865
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,720
Then I picked out that outfit.

866
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,520
I thought, since I'm here anyway, might as well have some fun.

867
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,520
Then I went to the front hall.

868
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,920
At five thirty-nine,

869
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,800
I was there waiting for everyone.

870
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,400
You can't get out of this room.

871
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,400
Around six o'clock,

872
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,080
we were here the whole time.

873
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,640
If the body

874
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,720
had been taken out of the room from here,

875
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,240
we definitely would have seen it.

876
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,840
We gathered here at six.

877
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,400
No,

878
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
the body was already there at six.

879
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
What he wrote was

880
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
"I want the body

881
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,040
to be taken out of your room."

882
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,120
In advance.

883
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Was it in advance?

884
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,560
That's right.

885
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,160
He also went to the parade.

886
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,960
That's right, he could leave halfway.

887
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,800
He could come back before us.

888
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
He could, before we returned,

889
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,640
move the body

890
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
out of the culprit's room.

891
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,600
That's right.

892
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
When we came back,

893
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,240
that door was locked.

894
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,920
The place with the iron chain.

895
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,640
So if

896
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,000
someone wanted to take the body there,

897
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,440
if someone wanted to take the body there,

898
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,800
could they walk back?

899
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,760
I got it.

900
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,960
It should be this route.

901
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,280
First, the victim is now

902
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,320
The first time and place of death should be

903
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,640
inside the house.

904
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Between 5:30 and 5:35.

905
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
In the front hall, right?

906
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,800
Inside the house.

907
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,520
He wasn't killed in the room.

908
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,240
As long as I wear the master ring,

909
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,880
I can control him all at once.

910
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,680
Leave your room.

911
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,480
This is the starting point of the death.

912
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,320
Actually, now we've confirmed

913
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,120
the endpoints for both people.

914
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
Why don't we try reasoning backward from the endpoint?

915
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,880
Okay, I'll go.

916
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,360
I'll give it a try.

917
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
How do we reason backward from the endpoint?

918
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,280
Is the controller's endpoint here?

919
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,800
No.

920
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,760
It's here.

921
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,480
Right.

922
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,520
Go in reverse.

923
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,560
He goes that way, and the other person goes this way.

924
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Opposite direction

925
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,840
No, it's not a mirror image

926
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,719
Now there's a problem

927
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,080
It's not a mirror image

928
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,480
He limps on his right leg

929
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,199
Then he took out a pen

930
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,159
Stabbed it into his stomach

931
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,600
Then dropped the ring

932
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,800
I'll go try it

933
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,280
We started here

934
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,760
If the endpoint is here

935
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,720
Your room and Ba's are the closest

936
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
That's right, this door is blocked

937
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes

938
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,840
So we have to

939
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,800
Go around from that side, that's right

940
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,840
That way, you two are the closest

941
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,760
This door is blocked.

942
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,160
If he was carrying the body,

943
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,080
he couldn't have gotten through here.

944
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,840
That's right.

945
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,400
So he only had this passage.

946
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,160
Let's check this passage.

947
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,480
Can we get back to the previous room?

948
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,040
Yes, come on, let's go.

949
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,600
Let's go, come on.

950
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,240
So we need to see

951
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,440
if he had the opportunity to commit the crime.

952
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,680
This is the way he walked.

953
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,760
But if he died in the front hall,

954
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,600
it would be the two closest rooms.

955
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
It would be easiest to move the body there.

956
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,240
If it was one of the farther rooms,

957
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,920
we would have to move the body

958
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,840
all the way over here.

959
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,800
If I had that much time, why would I...

960
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,560
He wouldn't need to move it.

961
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,040
Right.

962
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
He could just die there.

963
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,640
That person was wearing a ring.

964
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,000
Give it to him.

965
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,640
Just let him go.

966
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,320
Wait a second.

967
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,840
What's this?

968
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Purple blood.

969
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,720
It's not blood, it's...

970
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Yangmei, what kind of plum is this?

971
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Yangmei.

972
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,600
What purple plum?

973
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,200
Wumei.

974
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,840
Wumei jam.

975
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,280
Zize.

976
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,120
Zize.

977
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
It's me.

978
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,160
Lock.

979
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,520
Good joke.

980
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,360
No.

981
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,800
Do you know what this means?

982
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,960
I really like this joke.

983
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,400
Lock.

984
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
Go ahead, I'm listening.

985
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,960
"Zi" kill.

986
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,800
I thought you would say something constructive.

987
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,640
Still joking around.

988
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,920
He stepped on it.

989
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,520
He stepped on this.

990
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,120
Let's try it, let's try it first.

991
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,520
Let me see if I can get back to that place from before.

992
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Sister, why do you want to kill him?

993
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Because I want to return to my real body.

994
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,920
Wet paint.

995
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,920
There's red paint on his cloak.

996
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,360
He must have passed through here.

997
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,480
That's right.

998
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,120
He must have come from here.

999
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,840
Wet paint.

1000
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,320
Okay.

1001
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,600
Okay, let's go back, go back.

1002
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Go back.

1003
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Go back further.

1004
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
We've confirmed that this route is correct.

1005
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,680
Yes.

1006
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
It must have started from this flower hall.

1007
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
And gone this way.

1008
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,520
That's right.

1009
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:03,960
Yes.

1010
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,280
What we just reconstructed

1011
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
was the victim's route.

1012
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
The controller's endpoint is here.

1013
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,120
So the controller

1014
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,360
put the body here,

1015
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,320
then removed the ring.

1016
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,080
He ran to the back.

1017
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,360
Then started walking.

1018
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Like this, with your back to this.

1019
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,320
Look, see.

1020
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,200
I'm the controller, bro.

1021
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,000
Ready, walk forward.

1022
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,400
Turn left.

1023
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,000
Turn left.

1024
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,480
Turn left.

1025
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,160
Turn left, here we are.

1026
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
So the controller walked back.

1027
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,480
He was going forward.

1028
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,160
How about this?

1029
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,120
Why don't we bring him over and try it now?

1030
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,520
Yes, let's try it.

1031
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,280
There's a tape to mark the route.

1032
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
We can use that.

1033
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,520
Yes, that's right.

1034
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,720
Let's go, I'll get it.

1035
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Okay, you go get it.

1036
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
It's really pitiful to see you carrying everything by yourself.

1037
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,200
Stop carrying it.

1038
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,760
I'll keep you company.

1039
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,440
Don't carry it.

1040
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,880
Put it down.

1041
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,480
Don't take it.

1042
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,200
Put it down.

1043
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
Don't take it.

1044
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,360
Put it down.

1045
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,800
You—

1046
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,760
Put it down.

1047
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,400
Seriously.

1048
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
Where's the walkie-talkie?

1049
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,000
The walkie-talkie is in that tool basket.

1050
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,280
This is for you.

1051
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
What are you doing?

1052
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
So clumsy.

1053
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
Clumsy.

1054
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,600
Alright, let's first sort out

1055
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,880
the victim's route.

1056
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,280
Okay.

1057
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,080
Who will do it?

1058
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,720
I'll be in charge of holding this.

1059
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
I'll do the victim's route.

1060
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,560
It's from here, right?

1061
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,520
From the room.

1062
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,360
That's right.

1063
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
Wait a second.

1064
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,480
This is facing the right way.

1065
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,280
But he stabbed himself at that spot.

1066
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,600
Got it.

1067
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
We can just work backwards from the end point.

1068
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,520
Because we already know one person's route.

1069
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,400
Isn't the victim's end point over there?

1070
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,080
Let's start from the end point.

1071
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,120
If he turns right, or turns around,

1072
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,000
this person also turns around at the same time.

1073
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,760
Yes, both people move in sync.

1074
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,000
Right.

1075
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,520
I'll go to that end point.

1076
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,840
Let's use red for the victim, okay?

1077
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,440
Okay, let's do it.

1078
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's go.

1079
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,240
You go first now.

1080
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,080
Face the final direction you ended up in.

1081
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,720
That way, I can compare front, back, left, and right.

1082
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,120
Alright.

1083
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,560
Okay, now turn around.

1084
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,480
Start retracing your steps.

1085
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,880
Go forward, walk.

1086
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,000
I've reached a spot where I need to turn right.

1087
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,200
Turn right.

1088
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,960
Okay, turn right.

1089
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,520
Keep going right.

1090
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,000
Is there a staircase down?

1091
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,320
Go down the stairs.

1092
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
Then I need to turn right again.

1093
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Alright, okay.

1094
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Now I'm about to turn left.

1095
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
Turn left, okay.

1096
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,640
Next, I need to turn right again.

1097
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,280
Okay.

1098
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,880
Alright.

1099
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,440
Turn right, go straight ahead.

1100
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,320
We're here.

1101
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,640
It actually worked.

1102
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
I've already reached the entrance to the room's courtyard.

1103
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
I'm right at the door.

1104
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,320
I think this route is done.

1105
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,520
This should work.

1106
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,400
Because the two of us are in sync.

1107
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,760
Yeah.

1108
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280
But should we get the drone?

1109
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,080
To check things out.

1110
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,800
Sure.

1111
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,480
Where's the drone?

1112
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,080
In the ice cellar.

1113
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,360
Where's the ice cellar?

1114
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,800
Yeah, at that grid-shaped area.

1115
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
I'll go look for it.

1116
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,880
Is it this one?

1117
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,400
Yeah, let's go.

1118
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,480
How do you control this?

1119
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,840
No, just leave it here.

1120
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,800
Let's go back and let Bai watch it.

1121
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,560
Looks like the setup is done now.

1122
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,160
So it seems you're not X.

1123
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,360
I'm definitely not.

1124
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

1125
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,880
Do you think I'm the culprit?

1126
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,320
If you dare look at me like that again...

1127
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,520
From midnight to half past twelve last night...

1128
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,480
What happened, I will...

1129
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,840
What kind of skit is this now?

1130
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,440
Come on, Bai, come here.

1131
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,000
What's wrong?

1132
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
Come on, fly the drone and take a look.

1133
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,880
Alright, it's time again.

1134
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Time to show your real skills.

1135
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Take off.

1136
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,160
So beautiful.

1137
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,920
This is kind of cool.

1138
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,120
A little higher.

1139
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,720
This is where he died, right?

1140
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,120
Yes.

1141
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,080
Okay.

1142
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,760
It's this method.

1143
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,960
It must be this method.

1144
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,360
Alright.

1145
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,000
So which room is the starting point?

1146
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,240
Actually, what we need to reconstruct first is

1147
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,840
how, in one go,

1148
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,920
someone could start from one of these four rooms

1149
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,400
and walk straight through smoothly.

1150
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,920
So let's

1151
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,960
for example, test it now.

1152
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
That row.

1153
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,400
Those two rooms.

1154
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,560
Because I think it's the row.

1155
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,400
Which one is it?

1156
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,960
It's either one of these two people.

1157
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,200
I think we should just try it directly.

1158
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,840
Because it only works if he starts from a room.

1159
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,000
It's this technique.

1160
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,120
It must be this technique.

1161
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,280
Two people in sync.

1162
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,080
In one breath,

1163
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,000
you can go from a certain room

1164
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,880
and walk straight out smoothly.

1165
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,400
I got it.

1166
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,240
Take this route

1167
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,280
and confirm this roll.

1168
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,120
Then compare it to the route we cut out.

1169
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,280
Isn't it exactly the same?

1170
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
For example, if I confirm it's this room now,

1171
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
I cut the length of this room.

1172
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,400
I understand.

1173
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm against the wall.

1174
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Being against the wall or here will make a slight difference.

1175
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,200
Do you get what I mean?

1176
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,320
That's why we use tape.

1177
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,200
We stick it to the straightest corner.

1178
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,200
We have reference points like fire hydrants.

1179
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,040
Okay.

1180
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,840
That's fine.

1181
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,240
Okay.

1182
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,600
Let's go.

1183
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,480
Come on, let's get busy together.

1184
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Yeah, we have to do this together.

1185
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,800
Fly the drone over there.

1186
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,240
Okay.

1187
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,280
Above the red line, right?

1188
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:00,640
Right.

1189
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,680
Mud.

1190
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,280
This mud has also been stepped on.

1191
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,080
Look, there are footprints.

1192
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,680
He walked through this mud.

1193
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,200
Step on the mud.

1194
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,920
Step on the mud.

1195
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,200
Okay.

1196
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,320
Step on the mud.

1197
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,080
Slow down.

1198
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Slow down.

1199
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,160
Why?

1200
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm hooked.

1201
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
Wait a moment.

1202
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Don't go, don't go.

1203
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,880
What's wrong with you?

1204
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,600
I can't even hold you back and you're still leaving.

1205
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,480
Seriously.

1206
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,640
Not gentlemanly at all.

1207
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,480
You really act like an older brother.

1208
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Can you be like a brother?

1209
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,680
Okay.

1210
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,080
He died here.

1211
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,080
Okay.

1212
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,200
I will hold this place.

1213
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,480
Okay.

1214
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,720
Don't worry, no one can move me.

1215
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,280
You don't need to sit here.

1216
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,440
We just need to stick it on.

1217
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
You have a point.

1218
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,960
Sit here and guard this with your life.

1219
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,400
Right.

1220
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,560
I'm afraid someone might move this.

1221
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,800
It could affect us.

1222
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,600
No, we're all here keeping an eye on each other.

1223
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,840
No, what if his buddy shows up?

1224
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,040
Come on.

1225
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,360
Don't use this strong tape, it's easy to tear.

1226
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,720
Really?

1227
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,160
The strong tape comes off as soon as you tear it.

1228
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,440
Okay.

1229
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,200
You really are an expert.

1230
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,120
That's right.

1231
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,560
I'm the one who committed the crime.

1232
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,360
What a twist!

1233
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,400
Today, I'm the culprit.

1234
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,960
Then you're really cool.

1235
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,400
Where's the drone?

1236
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,320
Where did he fly it to?

1237
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,800
There's no drone here now.

1238
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,640
Here, the first turning point.

1239
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,400
Purple stain.

1240
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,480
We need to stick it down more firmly.

1241
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,200
Yeah.

1242
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,120
Do you have scissors?

1243
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,080
Give me some scissors.

1244
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,520
This strong tape.

1245
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,080
You can just tear it by hand.

1246
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,360
Strong tape.

1247
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,520
Try tearing this one.

1248
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,480
Give it to him.

1249
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,840
You couldn't tear it properly just now either.

1250
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,680
And you're still criticizing others.

1251
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,760
Didn't I just learn how?

1252
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,680
This strong tape.

1253
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,720
Can you teach me?

1254
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,640
Just tear it off like tearing paper.

1255
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Like tearing paper.

1256
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,360
Yeah.

1257
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm honestly speechless.

1258
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,280
If this...

1259
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,640
The person who's been nagging all day,

1260
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,240
ends up being the culprit,

1261
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,280
I really want to see

1262
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,520
what kind of expression he'll have on his face.

1263
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,680
This...

1264
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,560
This corner.

1265
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,840
There's red paint on his cloak.

1266
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,160
Wait a second.

1267
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,720
Is there any clue here?

1268
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,680
There's a marker here.

1269
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,800
Is there a marker?

1270
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,880
No, but there's mud.

1271
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,600
Okay.

1272
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,720
Besides this corner,

1273
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
Shouldn't the corner have some distance too?

1274
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,120
Let's do it like this then.

1275
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,800
Just line up the string with the mud.

1276
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,720
Right.

1277
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,600
Line it up with the mud.

1278
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,920
Pull it straight, right here.

1279
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,320
That's good.

1280
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,160
Okay, let's go back.

1281
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,960
Alright.

1282
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,000
Come here, by the door, the turning point.

1283
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,960
Head toward the yard.

1284
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,280
Go toward the yard.

1285
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,920
Don't step on it, you don't need to step on it.

1286
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,240
Don't step on it, or it'll bend.

1287
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,200
No, that's not what I meant.

1288
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,760
Move aside, take this...

1289
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,680
Yeah.

1290
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,600
Okay.

1291
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,160
Alright, I think I'm best suited for the drone.

1292
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,680
I'll give you the scissors.

1293
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,720
What, are you trying to fight for them?

1294
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,600
I realized something.

1295
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,800
Did you discover the tool that makes you the real culprit?

1296
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,760
That's right. I can't let you find out my secret.

1297
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,280
But since you've already found out,

1298
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,120
Don't worry.

1299
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,800
I have no choice but to...

1300
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,000
Don't worry.

1301
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,960
Don't move.

1302
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,760
We need to mark a spot here.

1303
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Whose place should we go to?

1304
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,200
Let's try it in my room.

1305
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,320
Because the distance between these two

1306
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,280
is the same, right?

1307
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,920
That's right.

1308
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,640
Mark "Jin" here.

1309
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,840
Jin and He.

1310
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,200
Okay.

1311
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,480
Okay.

1312
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:14,760
Let's go.

1313
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,400
Come here.

1314
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,280
These two rooms

1315
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,160
came this way.

1316
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,360
Step here.

1317
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,960
Come on.

1318
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,840
Go ahead, just walk over.

1319
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,920
Okay, just write it here.

1320
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,640
Ba and Bai.

1321
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,560
All done.

1322
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:27,960
Okay.

1323
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,680
Next, we'll take the green route.

1324
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,200
Just cut it off and go.

1325
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,160
Use the red one to go.

1326
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,520
The green route.

1327
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,880
Got it.

1328
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,760
Okay.

1329
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
Please cut it more precisely, I'm begging you.

1330
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,480
Then I should leave space for their names, right?

1331
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,000
Alright.

1332
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,800
I really want to lock in white.

1333
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,440
Really?

1334
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,960
But actually, I think

1335
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,800
it could also be He.

1336
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,400
I kind of agree.

1337
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,480
Let's go.

1338
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,520
Let me do it like this.

1339
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,000
When I was a kid, knitting sweaters,

1340
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,440
how many loops did you have to wind?

1341
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,760
I don't know.

1342
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,080
You can't just do it directly like this.

1343
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,280
Why don't you do it, then?

1344
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,400
All you do is say I didn't do it well.

1345
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,120
Isn't this fine?

1346
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:13,880
You go, you.

1347
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,520
You go.

1348
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,160
It feels like the five of us are acting like supervisors.

1349
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,920
The tape needs to stay on.

1350
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,720
Stick it on this paper.

1351
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,680
Because it's a fixed point.

1352
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,200
It's a turning point.

1353
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,400
Amazing.

1354
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,400
This episode is awesome.

1355
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:30,720
Okay.

1356
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,920
We've worked until it's dark.

1357
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,600
Okay, let's use the same method.

1358
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,320
Just now, we saw in the video footage

1359
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,240
the place where that man fell.

1360
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,320
Let's work backwards from there.

1361
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,880
Alright.

1362
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,040
What's wrong?

1363
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,480
Look at you.

1364
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,600
Go ahead, look.

1365
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,080
If you're going to accuse me like this,

1366
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,720
then I...

1367
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,640
You're accusing me too.

1368
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,440
I'm not accusing you.

1369
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,640
I'll keep an eye on you.

1370
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,840
At first, I was watching you.

1371
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,360
But then I started watching her.

1372
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,560
But now I suspect both of you.

1373
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,040
Now I'm watching you again.

1374
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
At the same time.

1375
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,840
Okay.

1376
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,160
Alright.

1377
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,600
Is this about right?

1378
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,040
Yes.

1379
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,640
Straighten it.

1380
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,480
You go.

1381
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,840
Go, run!

1382
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,760
Pull.

1383
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,120
Pull.

1384
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,960
Step.

1385
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,120
Pull, step on it, keep stepping.

1386
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,840
Alright, stop pulling and stepping.

1387
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,560
No, let's not pull each other down anymore.

1388
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,160
Okay.

1389
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,000
Let's stick together, okay?

1390
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,920
We're family.

1391
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,440
No.

1392
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,600
We have to pull each other down.

1393
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,040
We must pull each other down.

1394
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,120
We just have to.

1395
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,200
Turn right.

1396
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:24,960
Corner.

1397
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,040
Go.

1398
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,400
Let's go, we're off!

1399
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,840
Is this straightened?

1400
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,520
Yes, pull it again.

1401
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,560
Open it.

1402
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,680
Let it bloom.

1403
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,800
That's right.

1404
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,840
Good boy.

1405
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,760
Good boy.

1406
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,040
Let someone go again.

1407
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,880
Okay.

1408
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,440
How do you tie this knot?

1409
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,240
The knot came undone.

1410
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,080
Whoever tied the bell must untie it.

1411
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Turn here.

1412
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,480
Keep it close to the ground.

1413
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,400
Put it down.

1414
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,880
Okay.

1415
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,880
It's fine to turn here.

1416
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,360
Are we turning here?

1417
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,400
Turn right, turn that way.

1418
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,120
Then turn there again.

1419
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,720
Okay, ninety degrees.

1420
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,560
Turn.

1421
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:13,960
Turn.

1422
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,440
Turned right.

1423
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,280
This is turning into the yard.

1424
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,640
Yes.

1425
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,120
Yes.

1426
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,360
Almost the same, actually.

1427
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,640
Yes, it's just right.

1428
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,440
Okay, wait a moment.

1429
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,320
Why is there one here?

1430
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,440
This is Jin.

1431
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,080
And He’s room.

1432
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,120
And the fixed point at the door.

1433
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,480
Let's try this in my room.

1434
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,680
Because the distance between these two

1435
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,720
is the same, right?

1436
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,160
That's right.

1437
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,040
Okay.

1438
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,000
Then turn here.

1439
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,800
Which way do we turn?

1440
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,360
Right.

1441
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,440
Turn left.

1442
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,320
Either left or right is fine.

1443
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,680
Because those are two rooms.

1444
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,640
And now there's space on both sides.

1445
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,560
We can turn either way.

1446
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Either way is fine.

1447
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,360
Both ways work.

1448
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,560
Come on, let's try this first.

1449
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,640
Let's use this room.

1450
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,200
Yes.

1451
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,160
Jin.

1452
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,280
Jin's room.

1453
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,160
Okay, He’s room.

1454
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,640
You can also go this way.

1455
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,480
This isn't for identifying the culprit.

1456
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,640
This is for eliminating people, right?

1457
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,120
Eliminate—let's use the process of elimination now.

1458
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,240
Let's look here first.

1459
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,680
Maybe we'll turn over there in a bit.

1460
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,960
When we get to their rooms,

1461
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,480
one side doesn't have a room.

1462
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,000
Right.

1463
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,440
Or if it's a wall, it won't work.

1464
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,160
Then try me—see if it's possible for me.

1465
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,480
This works too.

1466
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,720
Here works too.

1467
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
Xiao Ba is eliminated.

1468
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:49,800
Right.

1469
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,000
You're eliminated.

1470
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,520
Because—

1471
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,360
Just saying—

1472
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,840
Go that way.

1473
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,960
That way is a wall.

1474
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,840
Right, you're eliminated.

1475
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,640
You've been eliminated.

1476
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,800
She hasn't been eliminated.

1477
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
You can't turn right, can you?

1478
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:01,840
Right.

1479
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,360
Then you're eliminated.

1480
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,280
Bro, go forward and try me.

1481
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,160
You're definitely fine, don't even think about it.

1482
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,600
It's empty.

1483
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,040
You're fine—this only eliminates Xiao Ba.

1484
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,800
It can only eliminate Xiao Ba.

1485
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,240
This is for eliminating Xiao Ba.

1486
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,960
Yes, that's right.

1487
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,840
Just saying—

1488
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,600
Darn you, Xiao Ba.

1489
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,600
Maybe

1490
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,640
Maybe our length

1491
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,560
just let us come straight in.

1492
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
We lined up on both sides.

1493
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,520
No.

1494
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,120
This can only fit one person.

1495
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,880
Okay, let me check.

1496
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,000
No.

1497
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,880
Yes.

1498
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,360
Let me see.

1499
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,200
Stop looking, we're already here.

1500
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,960
What about the one that was in the middle of us?

1501
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,520
Our middle

1502
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,000
You guys are here.

1503
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,000
You’re here.

1504
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,440
Then you turned left.

1505
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,160
Actually, the one that got removed was Ba.

1506
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,360
Right.

1507
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:47,840
This isn’t it.

1508
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,880
This is the one that got removed.

1509
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,040
Bro, stop overthinking it.

1510
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,880
I know.

1511
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,800
I did it, I already removed her.

1512
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,840
Then what are you still doing?

1513
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,240
Why are you going inside?

1514
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,320
Go that way.

1515
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,280
You can’t remove yourself.

1516
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,520
Bro, if you go further in,

1517
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,680
you still can’t remove yourself.

1518
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,680
You can’t remove me.

1519
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,360
Can’t I at least try to remove myself?

1520
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,480
Can’t I at least try?

1521
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,720
Besides, I look way too suspicious.

1522
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,000
There’s a door here.

1523
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,240
I'm way too suspicious.

1524
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,040
You're "sick."

1525
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,040
That's me, then.

1526
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,120
But what he said makes sense.

1527
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,600
For example, running over there,

1528
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,880
and putting a ring on him—

1529
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,560
that definitely has to be planned in advance.

1530
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,040
Yeah.

1531
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,600
After the morning folk activity ended,

1532
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
the killer's accomplice ran back ahead of time

1533
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,040
to help the killer deal with the body.

1534
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,920
He put the child ring on the corpse.

1535
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,080
He wore the mother ring.

1536
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,440
Then the accomplice controlled the corpse to leave the room.

1537
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,680
While heading to the suicide location,

1538
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
the deceased stepped in mud

1539
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,880
and also brushed against some wet paint.

1540
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,200
After going up the stairs,

1541
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,760
they stepped on a purple object

1542
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,840
and left footprints.

1543
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,200
Purple blood.

1544
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,560
Then, just before reaching the destination,

1545
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,720
the killer's accomplice

1546
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,320
accidentally bumped into an obstacle.

1547
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,520
An unusual collision.

1548
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,400
It was recorded by the cleaning robot behind

1549
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
which captured the final

1550
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,960
scene of stabbing himself with a brush.

1551
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,960
This created the illusion of a suicide in front of us.

1552
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,880
So this means that this route

1553
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,040
rules out Ba.

1554
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:12,880
Can't rule out.

1555
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,200
What are you doing?

1556
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,800
We worked all night for nothing.

1557
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,560
And you say we can't rule out?

1558
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,200
Ruled out.

1559
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,040
What's wrong with you?

1560
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,160
Ruled out.

1561
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,000
Ruled out.

1562
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,680
Let's go.

1563
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,080
Let's go discuss it.

1564
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,480
Okay.

1565
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,520
Come on.

1566
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,280
Come on.

1567
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,680
Come on, just say it.

1568
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,000
Vote.

1569
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,760
Vote.

1570
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,080
Come on.

1571
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,400
Detectives, both of you.

1572
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,960
Alright.

1573
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,080
Everything today,

1574
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,400
through our efforts all day,

1575
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,800
we finally managed to

1576
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,720
figure out the method,

1577
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,800
and we've identified the suspect.

1578
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,240
Yes.

1579
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,880
Those who had the ability to commit the crime

1580
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,920
are only Bai, Jin, and He.

1581
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,480
So the culprit

1582
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,440
must be the one who regained their memory.

1583
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,000
Right?

1584
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,000
Yes.

1585
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,080
That's correct.

1586
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,880
So we just need to find

1587
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,040
the person who regained their memory.

1588
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,880
The point about regaining memories is worth analyzing.

1589
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,800
Among the four of us,

1590
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,840
whoever regains their memory

1591
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,000
would go to find Big Brother right away.

1592
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,480
Right.

1593
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,880
I think among the three of us,

1594
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,120
whoever regains their memory

1595
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,440
could all possibly go to Big Brother first.

1596
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,240
Yes.

1597
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,200
No, the reason I said this

1598
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,600
was to clear myself of suspicion.

1599
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:22,840
Go on.

1600
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,960
Because if I regained my memory,

1601
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,560
the first people I would look for

1602
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,160
would definitely be the Two Butterflies.

1603
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,120
You find the Two Butterflies,

1604
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,160
and realize your real wife is this one.

1605
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,840
So you’re anxious to find Big Brother

1606
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,160
to switch our bodies back.

1607
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,520
That’s why you arranged to meet him at 5:30.

1608
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,720
It makes perfect sense.

1609
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,040
What’s unreasonable about that?

1610
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,600
Your level of urgency

1611
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,560
is the same for all four of us.

1612
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,640
We’ve already discussed this before.

1613
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,000
So how do you rule yourself out?

1614
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,320
I mean, who would you go to first?

1615
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,480
Definitely the Two Butterflies.

1616
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,600
Because it’s been such a long time since we met.

1617
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,200
To find your loved one.

1618
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,680
Right.

1619
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,400
Ruled out.

1620
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,360
It's been arranged.

1621
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,560
You've regained your memory.

1622
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,280
You go find your loved one.

1623
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,960
I've regained my memory.

1624
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,240
I'll also go find my loved one right away.

1625
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,040
He regained his memory, and he came to find me too.

1626
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,080
Is there anything about finding a loved one that can be left out?

1627
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,760
The timing of regaining memories now

1628
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,840
is something we can't determine the reason for.

1629
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,280
It's just that the gap was too long.

1630
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,600
White Coat deduction

1631
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,440
How about the White Coat deduction?

1632
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:27,920
White Coat

1633
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,280
It's pretty much what you just said.

1634
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,600
It's about what you just said.

1635
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,560
What did we just say?

1636
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,960
So what's your line of thinking?

1637
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,800
I don't have any ideas for identifying the culprit yet.

1638
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,640
To be honest,

1639
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,440
What about your direction?

1640
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,280
None for now. I don't have any ideas.

1641
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,480
How could I have a direction?

1642
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,880
Now we have to choose one out of three.

1643
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,560
You can at least be sure, right?

1644
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,240
One out of three.

1645
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,720
The ones I tend to suspect are He and Bai.

1646
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,120
Okay.

1647
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,000
If you ask me if I have anything else,

1648
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,760
any ideas for identifying the culprit,

1649
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,280
then I don't. Not at the moment.

1650
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,080
I'm even hiccuping.

1651
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,000
Laughing so hard I got hiccups.

1652
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,120
Okay.

1653
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,320
Actually, those who aren't suspects can speak up.

1654
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,760
Yeah, what do you think?

1655
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,840
Yeah, I think what you said is

1656
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,760
also quite important.

1657
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,200
Very important.

1658
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,960
It's just that

1659
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,520
I just looked over that again

1660
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,680
the chat log.

1661
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,360
I think the person most eager

1662
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,640
to find this She guy

1663
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,520
is He.

1664
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,920
You can take a look at the chat history.

1665
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,280
He really was quite anxious.

1666
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,720
Because every time he asked,

1667
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,240
"When will Xiao Ba come back?"

1668
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,320
he was always the first to speak.

1669
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,320
He seemed very impatient.

1670
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,440
Because when he asked that older brother,

1671
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,840
he said, "When will Xiao Ba come back?"

1672
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,000
And it was quite awkward.

1673
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,560
And all these things were said by him.

1674
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,120
Including when he found out that She-ge seemed to have

1675
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,200
committed murder,

1676
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
or was involved in a bombing case,

1677
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,640
he was also the first to speak about these things.

1678
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,200
Allow me to refute that.

1679
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,560
I kept asking about Ba in the group chat.

1680
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,880
What does that mean?

1681
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
It means I was eager to find my wife.

1682
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,800
So I just said,

1683
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,760
the first thing I would do

1684
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,920
is definitely go look for

1685
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,000
my two butterflies.

1686
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Doesn't that mean you've already regained your memory?

1687
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,760
That's how you know Xiao Ba is your wife.

1688
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,520
And not Jin, right?

1689
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,880
Right, if I regained my memory,

1690
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,360
that's the premise.

1691
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,040
And the second point,

1692
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,280
I am very,

1693
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,000
very,

1694
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,080
very strongly condemning

1695
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,280
my brother's actions.

1696
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,040
What does that represent?

1697
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,640
It means

1698
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,920
I am a person full of justice.

1699
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,200
I'm such a righteous person,

1700
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,120
how could I possibly commit murder?

1701
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,000
Let me share my two suspects for the real culprit.

1702
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,920
It's these two people.

1703
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,760
I'll start by explaining why it could be him.

1704
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,240
Because, like He Du,

1705
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,880
he's anxious about his wife.

1706
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,600
Their bodies got switched.

1707
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,480
So he wants to

1708
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,920
get his wife back as soon as possible.

1709
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,760
But he's not as anxious as the other guy.

1710
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,480
Right, and when it comes to switching wives,

1711
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,200
they're the same.

1712
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,440
There's another point.

1713
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,280
What kind of person

1714
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,320
would argue with Big Brother here?

1715
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,160
It must be someone who, in the group,

1716
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,200
has opposed Big Brother before.

1717
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,000
"Big Brother, I've completely regained my memory now."

1718
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,120
"You still created confusion for us."

1719
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,360
"Stop being so stubborn."

1720
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,880
Big Brother says, "I'm doing this for your own good."

1721
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,800
Big Brother says, "What's good about it?"

1722
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,280
"Is killing someone good?"

1723
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,600
Big Brother.

1724
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,280
Big Brother.

1725
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,480
Today was an accident.

1726
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,760
That's my line of thinking.

1727
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,760
I think the person most likely

1728
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,120
to have this kind of conflict with Big Brother

1729
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,280
such an intense conflict

1730
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,480
is either someone who wants to switch people,

1731
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,320
and if that's the case,

1732
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,920
all three of us have that motive.

1733
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,120
But the one most likely

1734
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,240
to argue with Big Brother

1735
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,600
I think is actually what you said,

1736
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,400
this sense of justice.

1737
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,080
That's all I have to say.

1738
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,560
First, as I just said,

1739
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,640
I really want to find my Ba.

1740
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,600
If I regain my memory,

1741
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,880
how can I let my real wife

1742
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,600
return to her real body?

1743
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,600
I can only rely on my big brother.

1744
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,280
At this point,

1745
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,480
do I still have to kill my big brother?

1746
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,560
Do you think that makes sense?

1747
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,240
If what you're doing is unreasonable,

1748
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,200
then all of us are being unreasonable.

1749
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,080
Because we all have things we want to exchange.

1750
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,400
So your premise is

1751
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,200
that I'm the one most desperate to find my "Ba".

1752
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,200
Me and him—

1753
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,560
No.

1754
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,400
You have the most direct conflict with Big Brother.

1755
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,880
Why would Big Brother give us the smoke?

1756
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,360
No.

1757
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,120
I don't think Big Brother and I have a conflict.

1758
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,480
Big Brother has always been helping me with this.

1759
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,960
He just hasn't succeeded yet.

1760
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,760
No, the conflict between you and Big Brother is

1761
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,560
that you were the one who mainly left the note.

1762
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,320
Bro, we need to do something.

1763
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,400
This is a note.

1764
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,320
And then in the group chat,

1765
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,400
you also took the initiative to talk to Big Brother.

1766
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,480
Big Brother, we already know your (plan).

1767
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,640
I'm leaving the group chat.

1768
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,480
We're all the same, same here.

1769
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,200
If that's the case,

1770
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,800
then I actually think his

1771
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,120
suspicion isn't that strong.

1772
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:48,640
Me too.

1773
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,280
Why?

1774
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,240
Let me give a simple example.

1775
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,440
When two brothers argue or fight,

1776
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
it's all out in the open.

1777
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,400
It's not like

1778
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,440
when you make a move,

1779
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,120
it always means using weapons.

1780
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,200
You just mentioned accidental killing.

1781
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,400
Today was an accident.

1782
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,800
But he took this knife from the hall.

1783
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,000
So it wasn't an accident.

1784
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,720
He came with a knife.

1785
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,680
He intended to stab him to death.

1786
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,560
That wasn't an accident.

1787
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,480
Then I think it's even less likely to be him.

1788
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,040
Why?

1789
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,360
Because I think

1790
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,400
all his conflicts are out in the open.

1791
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,960
Everyone knows those two don't get along.

1792
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,680
So if the boss dies,

1793
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,240
wouldn't everyone suspect him first?

1794
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,560
The key point in this story is

1795
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,960
that this person remembers this incident.

1796
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,880
I invited him here today

1797
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
just to stab him to death.

1798
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,240
So what's the purpose of stabbing him?

1799
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,200
He stabs him,

1800
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,920
I don't know.

1801
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,720
I want to mention something.

1802
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,880
What's the clue in this?

1803
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,880
It's that he has subordinates.

1804
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,520
I think that's an important clue.

1805
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,320
You need to think about it.

1806
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,080
In this Snake Gang,

1807
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,440
besides the boss,

1808
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,480
among the three of you,

1809
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,800
who is most likely

1810
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,320
to have their own subordinate?

1811
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,320
And none of you know about it.

1812
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,120
This person must be one of the key figures in the Snake Gang.

1813
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,040
Someone who is quite influential.

1814
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,720
I understand now.

1815
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,480
What is our ranking in the Snake Gang?

1816
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:20,920
Ranking?

1817
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,880
There's the first boss, second boss, and third boss.

1818
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,600
The matter of being the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth in charge—

1819
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,200
I think the order of ranking

1820
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:27,960
is definitely not

1821
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,560
the same as the order of influence I'm talking about.

1822
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,320
There must be real power involved.

1823
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,240
Even the sixth in charge

1824
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,440
can be a very influential person.

1825
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,200
I'm looking at personality.

1826
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,800
That's just something I thought of.

1827
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,040
Who, in this matter,

1828
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,720
is actually driving the whole process?

1829
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,680
Who started all of this?

1830
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,400
Because of her.

1831
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,680
Look at this evidence.

1832
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,880
I've printed it all out.

1833
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,960
It's clearer to look at it this way.

1834
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,600
First, the first one is from He.

1835
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,240
Brother, do you still have a way to help with Xiao Ba's situation?

1836
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,760
He asked about her first.

1837
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,960
Next, the second one is—

1838
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,240
The Bai Sect asked you.

1839
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:02,880
He said, "Brother,"

1840
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,000
"Do you still have a way to help with Xiao Jin's situation?"

1841
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,200
Right now, there's no way to switch bodies.

1842
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:06,920
I'm sorry.

1843
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,480
But here, there's something—

1844
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,600
I think this really highlights your personality.

1845
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,880
Here, Jin said something.

1846
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,920
Jin said, "Brother, you're too careless."

1847
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,160
"How could you mix up my body with Ba's?"

1848
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,840
I understand you were in a hurry.

1849
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,800
Right? It was a tough situation.

1850
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,840
But after all, he's the big brother.

1851
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,560
And then—

1852
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,720
The big brother said, "Just make do for now."

1853
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,000
"I'll help you switch back as soon as possible."

1854
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,360
Ba's body was also switched by mistake.

1855
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,560
But she didn't stand up to blame the big brother.

1856
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,280
What she said was—

1857
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,880
(Crying)

1858
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,640
Actually, being able to reunite with my daughter—

1859
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,760
I'm already very happy.

1860
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,360
I have a strong rebuttal to that.

1861
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:41,920
Go ahead.

1862
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,440
Because she's so beautiful—

1863
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,480
Of course she has nothing to worry about.

1864
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,080
Alright, no—

1865
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,160
That doesn't count.

1866
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:49,880
Objection overruled.

1867
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,840
Sit down.

1868
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,400
Objection overruled.

1869
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,640
My statement is very valid.

1870
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,960
Then if we could say just now

1871
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,720
all the clues point to him, he can be ruled out.

1872
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,400
Then I also feel like all the clues point to me.

1873
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,760
But instead, I was ruled out.

1874
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,040
Why is it so obvious in the group

1875
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,680
that everything is because of me?

1876
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,440
Let me finish.

1877
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,000
Here's the thing.

1878
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,480
Not all the clues point to you.

1879
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,400
That's actually not the case.

1880
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,880
Because we're analyzing personalities.

1881
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,520
Right.

1882
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,640
Then I want to ask,

1883
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,600
what does personality have to do with whether I can regain my memory

1884
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,520
or not?

1885
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520
My personality is dominant.

1886
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,120
I have conflicts with He and the big brother.

1887
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,840
But that doesn't determine who regains their memory.

1888
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,120
What he means is

1889
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,040
that the dominant personality is about having underlings.

1890
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
So the culprit

1891
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,640
must be someone in the Snake Gang family

1892
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,160
who is more opinionated.

1893
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,880
He has his own ideas.

1894
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,600
No.

1895
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
That doesn't mean I have a strong personality.

1896
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,760
It doesn't mean I have followers.

1897
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,720
I don't have a strong personality.

1898
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,960
I'm an honest person.

1899
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,400
But I'm the one who calls the shots here.

1900
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,280
Is that okay?

1901
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,080
Yes, of course.

1902
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,840
But only people with a strong personality

1903
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,480
would think they need to have followers.

1904
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,960
I think if you only rely on this one thing

1905
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,360
to say that's you,

1906
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,480
I don't agree with that.

1907
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,040
If you say, based on this matter,

1908
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,800
I think his suspicion is lessened.

1909
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,760
These two people are suspicious.

1910
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,800
I agree with this.

1911
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,760
If that's the case,

1912
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,280
I really can rule out those two. Why?

1913
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,560
Hey bro, is there a solution for Xiao Ba's issue?

1914
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,920
Bro, is there a solution for Xiao Jin's issue?

1915
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,840
You can tell at a glance that neither of them has their own opinion.

1916
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,120
If I can't make up my mind, I'll ask you.

1917
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,160
No, you two are really hard to find.

1918
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,160
When he's mentioned, you immediately step up.

1919
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,280
When she's mentioned, both of you step up right away.

1920
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,760
No, it's possible that X is playing in reverse.

1921
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,320
Playing in reverse.

1922
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,120
It's giving me a headache.

1923
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,640
Yeah.

1924
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,280
Is it possible?

1925
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,840
It's possible.

1926
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,360
Okay, if they can't make decisions on their own,

1927
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,720
then if he regains his memory today,

1928
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,280
do you think he wouldn't kill anyone?

1929
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:38,760
Is that right?

1930
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,960
Only one person regains their memory.

1931
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,440
Right?

1932
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:42,760
Right.

1933
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,080
Then the one who regains their memory must be him.

1934
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,400
I want to ask.

1935
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,280
So you think, based on whether someone has their own opinion,

1936
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,160
you can deduce if I've regained my memory?

1937
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:49,760
Does that make sense?

1938
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,680
It doesn't make sense.

1939
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,080
You're using whether someone has their own opinion

1940
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,400
to deduce if I have any followers.

1941
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,720
Yes.

1942
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,760
But what we decided today

1943
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,160
wasn't about who has followers.

1944
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,160
The follower belongs to everyone.

1945
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,040
No.

1946
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,640
No.

1947
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,280
Don't worry.

1948
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,240
No one knows I'm your subordinate.

1949
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,920
I can use the matching rings to help you.

1950
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,400
I'm not everyone's follower.

1951
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,880
No, I was the one who saved you all.

1952
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,240
He did save us.

1953
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,040
He’s his subordinate, so he saved us.

1954
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,280
No one knows I’m your subordinate.

1955
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,640
I don’t think it’s possible to use this

1956
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,800
to pin the crime on me.

1957
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,200
Because I switched into the wrong body.

1958
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,640
And I was in a hurry.

1959
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:25,960
Okay, sis.

1960
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,760
Then I won’t step on you now.

1961
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,360
I won’t step on you.

1962
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,240
And he’s mine.

1963
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,800
No, you can step on me.

1964
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,480
But I think I can argue this point.

1965
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,000
How? Go ahead, argue.

1966
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,600
Because my body was switched by mistake.

1967
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,160
I told the boss in the group chat.

1968
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,200
Help me, boss.

1969
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,800
You didn’t switch anyone else.

1970
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,040
You only switched me.

1971
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,040
Come save me quickly.

1972
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,240
I’m just someone with a strong personality

1973
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,080
who would have subordinates.

1974
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,040
I can only judge based on this information.

1975
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,160
And secondly,

1976
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,520
Weren’t we just trying to find out

1977
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,200
which of the three regained their memory?

1978
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,400
Isn’t the key now to find

1979
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,960
who regained their memory?

1980
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,640
Not who has subordinates.

1981
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,120
Wait a moment.

1982
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:14,680
You startled me.

1983
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,560
Wait a second.

1984
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:16,920
You scared me.

1985
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,440
That gave me a fright.

1986
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,400
Hold on.

1987
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,040
Wait.

1988
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,000
There was a recording in my room just now.

1989
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,680
Right.

1990
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,160
If you remember me,

1991
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,200
you have to sing "Two Butterflies."

1992
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,680
Yes.

1993
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,240
Then the guy sang "Two Butterflies."

1994
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,520
Darling, fly slowly.

1995
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,840
Doesn't that mean he regained his memory?

1996
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:45,480
No.

1997
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,440
It's because I saw that yesterday.

1998
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,200
I heard that recording.

1999
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,680
No, you heard it.

2000
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,160
But you suddenly sang that in the middle of the night.

2001
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,520
It really is a bit, you know...

2002
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,080
far-fetched.

2003
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:54,920
I told you,

2004
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,320
I sang "Two Butterflies"

2005
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,800
because I heard that recording during the day.

2006
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,360
At night, I remembered the "Two Butterflies" thing.

2007
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,840
So I hummed a bit of it.

2008
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,960
If you say

2009
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,400
that recording

2010
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,720
said, "If you remember me,"

2011
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,120
then sing this song,

2012
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,440
him singing

2013
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,320
singing in the middle of the night is way too obvious.

2014
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,240
Yeah.

2015
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,280
Doesn't that mean he got his memory back?

2016
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,680
There's something especially strange about you all.

2017
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,279
What is it?

2018
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,600
If it's too obvious, then it's impossible.

2019
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,760
Wait, that recording of his—

2020
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,200
He didn't record it late at night and leave it there.

2021
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,000
Maybe it's like I said before.

2022
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,160
Then he just left it there.

2023
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,000
He just put it there.

2024
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,319
Then he remembered.

2025
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,840
When he was singing, this thing recorded it.

2026
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,560
He didn't know it would get recorded.

2027
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,120
No.

2028
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,920
Go listen to the recording again.

2029
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,720
The recording says—

2030
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,680
When I come to find you again,

2031
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,600
I will definitely be singing

2032
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,319
"Two Butterflies" when I come to find you.

2033
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:43,720
Right.

2034
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,439
It's not saying "when I think of you,"

2035
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,240
I sing "Two Butterflies."

2036
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,680
Yes, that's the original wording.

2037
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,479
It really is, it really is.

2038
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,840
Don't change a single word, or you'll change the whole meaning.

2039
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,600
I'm going to find her while singing.

2040
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,800
Alright, nice argument.

2041
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,840
You've regained my trust.

2042
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,560
I now clearly think it's He.

2043
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,840
Because he and Big Brother

2044
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,439
have a known conflict.

2045
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:08,840
Okay.

2046
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,960
My belief is that he has a conflict with Big Brother.

2047
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,600
Just like you believe I have subordinates.

2048
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:13,960
Okay.

2049
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,200
I think the suspicion is quite strong.

2050
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,479
Between the two of them, I think it's him.

2051
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:19,040
And just now, when I said this,

2052
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,479
he said, "Then I actually don't think it's He."

2053
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:23,080
On this point, I think he handled his reaction well.

2054
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:23,640
Because this person,

2055
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,960
I can only read his demeanor.

2056
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,359
Okay.

2057
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,920
So now I firmly believe

2058
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,560
he's not the problem, I think it's him.

2059
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,000
Alright.

2060
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:30,840
Thank you.

2061
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,800
Even though you cleared me,

2062
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,200
I haven't cleared you yet.

2063
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,640
I still have to suspect both of you.

2064
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,240
Okay.

2065
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,160
That's fine, that's acceptable.

2066
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,840
This line of thinking is reasonable.

2067
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,520
No, actually Ba also expressed

2068
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,319
she thinks it's me.

2069
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,720
And Detective Bai also

2070
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,920
he thinks it's me.

2071
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,840
Yes, he thinks it's you.

2072
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,640
Now it depends on Ning's vote.

2073
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,840
Then you say something.

2074
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,840
I can't say anything.

2075
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,600
Why?

2076
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,040
Because I really don't know.

2077
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,120
If you don't state your opinion, then you're X.

2078
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,120
You have to say something.

2079
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,520
If you refuse to speak now,

2080
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,080
we'll have to consider you as X.

2081
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:01,520
Yes.

2082
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,560
No, I think that's right.

2083
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,200
If that's the case,

2084
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,720
If I speak up, I think it's unfair to you.

2085
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,560
You think it's me.

2086
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,000
Then I can only choose you.

2087
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,840
You think it's me.

2088
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,800
I don't think it's you.

2089
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,520
Brilliant.

2090
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,520
Both detectives think it's me.

2091
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,240
Brilliant.

2092
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,360
It's come to this critical moment.

2093
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,320
Can I still not clear my name?

2094
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,440
No, I just said it now.

2095
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,960
I don't mean I'm definitely choosing you.

2096
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,360
Come on, let's vote.

2097
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,320
Alright, let's vote then.

2098
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,040
Okay, okay.

2099
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,440
Bro.

2100
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,160
It can't be you, right?

2101
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,480
Don't lie to me.

2102
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,240
If you lie to me today,

2103
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,920
I'll be really upset.

2104
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,720
I'm telling you, I'm voting for her.

2105
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,400
I'm voting for her.

2106
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,040
Okay.

2107
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,800
Who are you voting for?

2108
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,520
Who is she?

2109
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,080
Jin.

2110
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,200
If it were you today,

2111
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,200
I’d put you on a pedestal.

2112
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,560
I’m telling you,

2113
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,600
I still believe he is X.

2114
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,320
"Jin Ke assassinates Qin"

2115
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,480
What is that?

2116
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,840
What are you talking about?

2117
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,320
You’re really strange.

2118
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,800
What?

2119
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,560
Bro, trust me.

2120
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,480
If you were X,

2121
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,840
But it’s fine, I’m still voting for Jin.

2122
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
Yeah, it’s fine, go ahead and vote.

2123
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,560
I can’t change your vote.

2124
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,920
Today, my pick for the real culprit is

2125
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,000
Jin.

2126
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,840
Her motive was love,

2127
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,120
and also justice.

2128
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,000
As for how the crime was committed,

2129
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,840
right after thirty-five ended,

2130
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,320
she immediately called her underling.

2131
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,840
She had this underling help her.

2132
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,480
The underling operated the special rings.

2133
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,840
He helped her carry out

2134
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,840
the cover-up of the murder.

2135
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,000
I’m voting for

2136
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,080
Jin and He as the main suspects.

2137
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,240
Their suspicion is quite high.

2138
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,320
I voted for the real culprit as

2139
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,400
This time, the culprit I chose is

2140
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,720
Today’s pick for the real culprit

2141
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,800
The killer I voted for is

2142
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

2143
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,560
Unbeatable low prices can't be hidden

2144
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,640
Next, we move on to

2145
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,320
the moment of revealing the truth about Tongcheng Travel

2146
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,360
We won

2147
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,520
In today's case

2148
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,440
the suspects are

2149
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,680
Gudefuhe

2150
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,560
Batefulai

2151
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,480
Baideboyi

2152
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,360
Jingoubaio

2153
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,240
Two of them received votes

2154
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:42,680
They are respectively

2155
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,800
Gudefuhe

2156
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,320
Jingou Baio

2157
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:50,880
Step forward

2158
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,320
Step forward, go

2159
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,680
How many votes did each get?

2160
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,440
Tell me

2161
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:58,960
Three, three

2162
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,360
You don't have a tie

2163
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,280
Four, two

2164
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,920
No tie

2165
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,280
I thought no one voted

2166
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,560
Then what did I vote for?

2167
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,000
No tie

2168
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,080
Someone got more, someone got less

2169
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,440
They received respectively

2170
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,160
They received four votes

2171
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,800
and two votes

2172
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,400
That's right

2173
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:23,840
That's right

2174
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,760
The good guys lost

2175
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,520
Won

2176
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,360
The good guys won

2177
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,360
Who are the good guys?

2178
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,080
No, you don't know yet if the good guys won or lost

2179
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,960
Because none of you know

2180
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,560
who the killer is

2181
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,880
How do you know if the good guys won or lost?

2182
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,040
What if I'm the killer?

2183
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,840
Goodbye. You, goodbye.

2184
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,600
Okay.

2185
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,280
Sorry.

2186
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,160
Sorry.

2187
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,240
If Ba is the killer,

2188
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,520
we'll be so embarrassed.

2189
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,760
No, she absolutely can't be.

2190
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,600
If she's the killer,

2191
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,400
we recorded today for nothing.

2192
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:49,800
Right.

2193
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,520
We spent the whole night sticking glue there.

2194
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,640
We were sweating all over.

2195
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,880
That means it was all for nothing.

2196
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,600
It would be a total surprise.

2197
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,240
Impossible.

2198
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,680
Let's look forward to the result.

2199
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,240
Escaped with zero votes.

2200
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,160
If it's her,

2201
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,120
You're still pretending.

2202
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,920
You're still pretending.

2203
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,880
Let me tell you the truth.

2204
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,880
I'm the killer.

2205
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,360
Yes.

2206
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,240
Finally admitted it.

2207
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,120
Come on.

2208
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:20,840
Say it.

2209
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,120
The one who got four votes is...

2210
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,840
The one who received four votes is

2211
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,000
Jin Gou Bai Ou

2212
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,880
How could it be me?

2213
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,160
If not you, then who?

2214
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,560
Today's suspect

2215
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,160
Jin

2216
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,960
The process of committing the crime

2217
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,840
involved using

2218
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
the synchronized ring

2219
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,360
Jin Gou Bai Ou

2220
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,440
I just went back to that hall again

2221
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,720
to look for some new clues

2222
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,200
Then I discovered

2223
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,360
that Jin and He are both highly suspicious

2224
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,360
Their suspicion is quite high

2225
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,440
During the whole conversation

2226
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,320
every question was raised by He

2227
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,200
asking what should we do, what to do

2228
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,400
He tends to discuss things

2229
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,880
to look for answers

2230
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,280
Jin, on the other hand, is impatient

2231
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
Brother, you were too careless

2232
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,760
How could you switch to the wrong body?

2233
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,000
So I considered the possibility

2234
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,480
that the person who accidentally killed the eldest brother

2235
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,600
was

2236
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,040
Jin

2237
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,320
Today, my choice for the real culprit is

2238
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,080
Jin

2239
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,360
I'm voting for

2240
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,000
He

2241
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,320
The culprit I'm voting for is

2242
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:35,880
He

2243
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,880
How could it be me?

2244
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,520
I think her reaction is just...

2245
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,080
I think if it wasn't you,

2246
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,040
and you reacted like this,

2247
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,040
then you shouldn't have reacted this way.

2248
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,640
No, your reaction isn't right either.

2249
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,600
So you're not X.

2250
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,680
Of course I'm not X.

2251
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,000
Success or failure in identifying the culprit.

2252
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,600
Golden Hook Breaks the Lotus Root.

2253
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,720
Is she the real culprit in this case?

2254
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,520
The real culprit is...

2255
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,080
Golden Hook Breaks the Lotus Root.

2256
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,880
Great.

2257
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,360
So annoying.

2258
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,840
So annoying.

2259
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,400
How did we fail so badly?

2260
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,920
The X in this case is Good Morning.

2261
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,920
So if you're X, why did you just go "ah"?

2262
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,240
I'm X.

2263
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,280
Sorry, I lied to you.

2264
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,960
It's okay.

2265
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,520
He actually thought I was X all day.

2266
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,040
Right?

2267
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,520
Of course I thought you were X.

2268
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,320
So, when did you

2269
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,480
change your mind about that?

2270
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,080
I never changed my mind.

2271
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:55,720
Alright.

2272
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,200
Why do you care so much about what he thinks?

2273
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,840
The focus now should be on comforting me.

2274
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,080
What do you need comfort for?

2275
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,480
You're the killer, what comfort do you need?

2276
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,560
Why did you vote for her?

2277
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,840
Well, it's because later he said

2278
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,280
In that recording, didn't he say that line?

2279
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,320
Yeah, yeah.

2280
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,120
Then I went back and looked at the evidence again.

2281
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,520
I felt like it should be La Ke.

2282
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,920
Their debate

2283
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,320
actually influenced me.

2284
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
The real culprit was an accidental killer.

2285
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,240
Plus, he was really anxious.

2286
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,560
And maybe also because of our family relationship.

2287
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,800
So I voted for Jin.

2288
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,440
It's because

2289
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,400
you're a brave girl.

2290
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:31,640
Why?

2291
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,240
And you were really anxious.

2292
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:32,760
Wait a second.

2293
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,880
You really were anxious.

2294
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,800
Wait.

2295
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,640
And then I thought of something else.

2296
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,840
When we got that

2297
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,280
phone used to call the underling,

2298
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,240
it was at your room's door.

2299
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,680
Right here.

2300
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,800
Old Master's room

2301
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,920
This phone was here.

2302
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,720
Right here.

2303
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:54,840
Let me tell you,

2304
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,400
that wasn't my key clue at all.

2305
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,120
Everything you all mentioned at the scene

2306
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,880
wasn't anything that could incriminate her.

2307
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,560
There was no evidence.

2308
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,280
Right, no evidence.

2309
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,400
The crucial evidence everyone missed was

2310
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:05,960
last night,

2311
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,120
in the room where Jin Gou Bai Ou stayed.

2312
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,480
Because she regained her memory,

2313
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,240
she made another pair

2314
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,160
of elephants out of lotus root.

2315
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,000
On them, she carved Bai De Boyi

2316
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,600
and Jin Gou Bai Ou's names.

2317
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,440
Why don't you get up first?

2318
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,880
No.

2319
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,920
I'm not getting up.

2320
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,960
I don't want to.

2321
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,240
Poor little sister.

2322
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,920
You know, Liu Yuning and I—

2323
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,160
I can already imagine this episode of ours

2324
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:36,800
is going to be edited to look so silly.

2325
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,840
It's really funny.

2326
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,560
The funniest part is,

2327
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,240
the two of us,

2328
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,920
when X and the culprit recognized each other,

2329
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,360
Wait a second.

2330
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,680
You know, the two of us—

2331
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,760
Let me tell you this story.

2332
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,920
Wait, what happened with you two?

2333
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,320
Here's what happened.

2334
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,240
When the two of us were facing X,

2335
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,240
I saw it was her,

2336
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,400
and she saw it was me.

2337
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,520
She said, "Bro, we're definitely winning today."

2338
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,680
She said, "We're going to escape with zero votes today."

2339
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,480
I said, "Okay."

2340
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,000
If we don't escape with zero votes today,

2341
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,400
we won't even take the keys.

2342
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,760
Major twist.

2343
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,040
I said, "When tonight ends,"

2344
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,200
the meal we go out for

2345
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,440
will be our celebration dinner.

2346
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,080
This part must be kept.

2347
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,080
Cut all of it out for me.

2348
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,080
I told Jinhook when we split up,

2349
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,040
if we can't escape with zero votes today,

2350
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,240
we'll give up the Golden Key.

2351
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,720
That's how bold we are.

2352
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,760
We have to make a comeback—perfect teamwork.

2353
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,400
Let these friends see what it means to

2354
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,920
I wanted to say "advanced gameplay,"

2355
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,960
but I was too shy to say it.

2356
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,840
So I said "a powerful alliance."

2357
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,240
Let's shake up

2358
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,640
the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning."

2359
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,480
Let's do it together.

2360
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,120
But in the end, we...

2361
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,360
Cut out the part where

2362
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,280
X and the culprit recognize each other.

2363
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,240
That's how bold we are.

2364
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,720
Let's go back and re-record now.

2365
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,800
We'll say,

2366
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,960
"It's so hard to win today."

2367
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,240
"We're doomed today."

2368
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,560
"It feels really tough today."

2369
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,000
Today, Dilraba used

2370
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,520
her second targeted card on Jin Jing.

2371
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,160
Targeting someone—why is it this again?

2372
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,920
Yeah, you have two chances to target.

2373
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,360
You're such an adorable little sun.

2374
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,240
You're truly an adorable little sun.

2375
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,640
You're truly an adorable little sun.

2376
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,280
You look good no matter what.

2377
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,120
You're a brave girl.

2378
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,520
You're a brave girl.

2379
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,840
Thank her—she's still the best.

2380
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,560
It's getting foggy.

2381
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,000
It's getting foggy.

2382
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,440
What's going on?

2383
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,200
Wait a moment.

2384
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:13,960
Here it comes.

2385
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,960
Forty hours have passed.

2386
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,200
What did you gain this time?

2387
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,120
We obtained four golden keys.

2388
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,640
We gained humiliation.

2389
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,400
Disgrace.

2390
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,520
Gained, yes.

2391
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,200
We found out.

2392
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,000
Who this "She" is.

2393
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,440
Right, and we also learned the story.

2394
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,440
And this fog.

2395
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,520
Smoke bomb.

2396
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,720
This.

2397
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,320
It's called the "Oblivion Bomb."

2398
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,760
Someone used this bomb on us again.

2399
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,360
So in the end, do we need to

2400
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,920
recover our true identities?

2401
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,200
If at first we thought

2402
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,520
that

2403
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,840
the mastermind behind everything

2404
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,320
was "She,"

2405
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,520
but "She" is already dead.

2406
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:52,880
Right.

2407
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,440
Then why is all of this still happening?

2408
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:56,880
Yeah.

2409
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,400
So it means someone is still switching.

2410
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,200
It's not about whether "She" is dead or not.

2411
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,680
"She" only lost one body.

2412
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,360
He found a new body.

2413
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,720
His soul actually left the body.

2414
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,480
No, it's also possible

2415
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,280
that the real "She" is among us.

2416
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,120
I think we've all regained our memories.

2417
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,080
Now, that person

2418
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,520
already knows they're the mastermind.

2419
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,200
Yes.

2420
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,080
But there's one thing here.

2421
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,400
Didn't it say above

2422
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,920
that when they perform this rebirth ritual,

2423
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,200
smoke rising means the ritual is successful?

2424
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,960
So that means right now,

2425
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,040
is someone performing the ritual?

2426
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,120
Is that why there's smoke?

2427
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:52,720
It's possible.

2428
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,280
No.

2429
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:54,880
Really?

2430
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,320
If it's really as you think,

2431
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,240
then that's bad.

2432
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,440
I'll find a way to confirm it.

2433
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,440
Tonight,

2434
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,120
you should just use your current bodies for now

2435
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,120
and get some rest.

2436
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,960
I'll come back here to find you first thing in the morning.

2437
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,960
And tomorrow, you'll know

2438
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,560
your true past and identity.

2439
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,800
True identity?

2440
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,960
We are Helimo Jinyu.

2441
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,920
Do you remember now?

2442
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,400
You were the cleaning lady in there.

2443
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,360
The cleaning lady?

2444
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,080
Your mishearing is pretty impressive, baby.

2445
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,960
Even Bulgaria showed up.

2446
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,800
I've been doing Bulgarian split squats lately.

2447
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,520
No, this thing hasn't been delivered yet.

2448
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,200
I just forgot for a moment.

2449
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,360
Why are you treating me like this?

2450
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,680
Because I got it.

2451
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:43,600
Come on.

2452
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,680
Let's welcome our...

2453
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,280
Here, let me do it.

2454
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,080
We can't torment our...

2455
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:47,600
Thanks, bro.

2456
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,720
...lovely Jin Jing today.

2457
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,880
Here, congratulations.

2458
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,520
Here, take the plate.

2459
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,840
Alright, congratulations.

2460
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:56,720
That's really good.

2461
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:57,920
You've grown.

2462
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,480
Why?

2463
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,560
You let me win.

2464
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,640
You let me win.

2465
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Why?

2466
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,120
I want to hear the current Golden Key rankings.

2467
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,560
The current Golden Key leaderboard...

2468
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,680
The person in first place is...

2469
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,120
Zhou Keyu

2470
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,680
Five golden keys

2471
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,720
Look at how smug you are

2472
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,640
Your mouth

2473
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,040
I didn't have any expression just now

2474
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,760
You keep saying I'm smug

2475
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,200
No, you always look like this

2476
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,800
No

2477
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,400
You can't

2478
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,920
You can't observe people so closely

2479
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,320
Hurry up

2480
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,400
In second place is

2481
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,280
Bai Yu

2482
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,400
Four golden keys

2483
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,400
No way, we can't let him win tomorrow

2484
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,360
In third place is

2485
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:56,960
Jin Jing

2486
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,640
Dilraba

2487
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,720
Zhang Linghe

2488
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,560
Each has three golden keys

2489
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,600
Liu Yuning got two golden keys

2490
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,560
What are you doing

2491
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,880
I'm crying

2492
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,440
I already said we're both clowns

2493
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,160
We just need to play the clown role well

2494
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,880
That's enough

2495
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,200
Clown, is that you

2496
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,560
Zhou Ke(yu)

2497
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,560
Really

2498
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,400
You are Zhou Keyu

2499
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,600
Zhou Keyu

2500
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,480
Zhou Keyu

2501
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,200
Yes

2502
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,440
Alright, let's rest for today

2503
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,800
See you tomorrow morning

2504
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,080
Let's go

2505
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,360
In today's case,

2506
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:36,960
this perpetrator

2507
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,320
during the altercation,

2508
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,560
killed She Nan.

2509
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,720
If, during this altercation,

2510
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,800
he did not intend to kill,

2511
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,320
but only meant to cause intentional harm,

2512
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,560
then, in the process of intentional harm,

2513
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,320
he negligently caused the victim's death.

2514
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:48,960
These issues

2515
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,560
are actually not criminal law issues.

2516
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,680
They are matters of evidence law.

2517
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,320
So, in reality,

2518
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,840
what evidence you can obtain

2519
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,320
will determine

2520
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,960
whether he committed intentional homicide,

2521
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,880
negligent manslaughter,

2522
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,080
or some other crime.

2523
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,960
If his motive was

2524
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,520
Stop She man's plan

2525
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,880
Kill him

2526
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,000
So in this situation

2527
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,560
what we call "using evil to fight evil"

2528
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,040
how is this different from legitimate self-defense

2529
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,880
what is the difference

2530
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,800
What is legitimate self-defense

2531
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,240
It is to stop unlawful infringement

2532
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,480
The legal result is

2533
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,520
no criminal responsibility is borne

2534
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,160
But in today's case

2535
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,040
we see that he himself

2536
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:19,800
was also carrying out

2537
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,040
an unlawful act at the same time

2538
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,360
while stopping another unlawful act

2539
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:22,920
This situation

2540
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,960
is fundamentally different from legitimate self-defense

2541
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,920
There is an essential difference

2542
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,280
What is the essential difference

2543
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,320
It lies in his intention to defend

2544
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,080
which is different

2545
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,080
So this intention to defend

2546
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,600
should be divided into two parts

2547
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,560
for analysis

2548
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,600
One is his will to defend

2549
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,960
that is, whether you intend

2550
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,600
to stop an unlawful infringement

2551
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,240
The other is your awareness of defense

2552
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,600
that is, whether you realize

2553
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,800
that your action is

2554
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,960
to stop an unlawful infringement

2555
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,240
The awareness of defense we just discussed

2556
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,360
In this situation, there isn't any.

2557
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,600
In other words, you intentionally carried out

2558
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,880
a crime that you intended to commit.

2559
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,160
You weren't planning

2560
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,640
to stop an unlawful act.

2561
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,840
You just happened

2562
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,320
to stop an unlawful act by chance.

2563
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,920
So you didn't have the awareness of self-defense.

2564
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,640
In this kind of situation,

2565
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,040
we believe you

2566
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,320
cannot be considered as acting in legitimate self-defense.

2567
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,320
First, of course, we should consider

2568
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,160
seeking help from public authorities.

2569
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,680
If it's a criminal matter,

2570
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,520
we should report it to the police or file a complaint.

2571
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,880
These are some ways to resolve it.

2572
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,040
Of course, we can also use the media in normal situations.

2573
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,080
In urgent situations,

2574
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,720
we can also use private remedies.

2575
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,280
For example, methods like legitimate self-defense.

2576
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,960
Or emergency measures to avoid danger.

2577
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,640
to protect our legal rights.

2578
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,920
We have to keep tracking this person.

2579
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,040
But this person is dead.

2580
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:27,760
That's a bit strange.

2581
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,440
Is it possible

2582
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,840
that person wasn't She?

2583
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,520
Iris printer printing in progress.

2584
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:33,840
Doesn't match.

2585
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,640
He's not She.

2586
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,360
Wait a moment.

2587
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,440
So this is the little brother.

2588
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,280
The body is his.

2589
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,640
But the core might not be his.

2590
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,520
So She is still alive.

2591
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:39,720
That's right.

2592
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,400
Still haven't found it.

2593
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,040
His soul.

2594
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,720
Could be reborn in that paper figure again.

2595
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,840
We need to burn him now.

2596
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,280
And let him

2597
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,440
be completely destroyed.

2598
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,360
We have to do it now.

2599
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,560
Let's start burning.

2600
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,560
It's burning.

2601
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,040
Consciousness has been transferred.

2602
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,840
Consciousness has been transferred.

2603
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,320
Now among the six of us, She is already here.

2604
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,440
It's locked.

2605
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,320
This door won't open.

2606
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,040
Why is someone barging in again?

2607
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:01,640
What are you doing?

2608
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,960
You are so ruthless.

2609
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,680
She.

2610
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,760
You miscalculated.

2611
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,320
Think of a way.

2612
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:05,840
Think of a way.

2613
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,400
Come.

2614
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,320
I have a key in my hand.

2615
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,440
Don't look at me like that.

2616
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,160
Watch your mouth.

2617
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,040
Rich young lady.

2618
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:10,760
Now that you put it that way,

2619
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,040
Why do you look so guilty?

2620
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,320
It really wasn't me.

2621
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,080
She.

2622
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,680
She.

2623
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,040
You know he's calling you.

2624
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,280
Stop playing like this.

2625
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,320
I'm begging you.

2626
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:19,880
Go quickly.

2627
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,760
Send him, stop him.

2628
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,000
You have no right to make this decision.

2629
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,560
Everything will repeat.

2630
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,240
The scary part is coming.

2631
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,560
After the six detectives are reborn,

2632
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,480
He made us lose our memories.

2633
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,400
Forgetting again and again.

2634
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,680
It's that child in the water.

2635
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,760
Then who is he going to send it to?

2636
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,360
TYJ.

2637
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,440
A useless thing.

2638
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,520
I have a more perfect plan.

2639
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,880
Blow them all up.

2640
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,360
Unable to return to an earlier time.

2641
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,880
I went to save you.

2642
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,800
I secretly went to my brother's base.

2643
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,960
But he wasn't there.

2644
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,360
So I left a note.

2645
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,840
To avoid suspicion,

2646
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,040
I brought him to the room we’re staying in tonight.

2647
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,200
I questioned him about why he made us lose our memories.

2648
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,040
Why did he do these bad things?

2649
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,080
The parade started on time.

2650
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,120
I finished the parade with everyone.

2651
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,720
Then we all returned to Goodhouse together.

2652
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
It looks delicious.

2653
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,360
The food in jail isn’t bad.

2654
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,840
If we finish this meal,

2655
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:11,560
they’ll be back.

2656
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,600
We’re all locked up together, right?

2657
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:12,960
There’s a way.

2658
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,720
We can lock ourselves in the cell.

2659
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,680
They won’t be able to get in.

2660
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,800
Will you scare people?

2661
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:17,880
Do you think

2662
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,200
You’re so close right now.

2663
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:19,960
I’m totally charmed by you.

2664
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,600
I definitely won’t vote for you today.

2665
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,680
No, you have to vote for him.

2666
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,600
Who is it?

2667
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,360
I want to eat peanuts, bro.

2668
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,240
Buy whatever you want to eat.

2669
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,320
May wealth come from all directions.

2670
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,840
No money, but still hoping for wealth.

2671
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:31,840
Wealth.

2672
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,600
I want this one.

2673
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,440
Actually, both are tasty.

2674
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,160
I want to eat this one.

2675
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,320
Then you eat this one.

2676
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,360
No more shouting.

2677
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:38,960
Teachers.

2678
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,080
Round slicked-back hair

2679
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,120
Every debt has its owner

2680
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,640
The one who surrendered is

2681
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,080
Zhou Keyu

2682
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:49,880
I really don't remember this

2683
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,160
Please don't explode

2684
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,320
Then I'm sorry

2685
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:53,840
Take a shot

2686
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:56,800
Jin Jing

2687
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,280
Reba

2688
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:57,760
Zhang Linghe

2689
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,160
Zhou Keyu

2690
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:58,640
Liu Yuning

2691
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,040
Bai Yu

2692
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,360
I know this one
