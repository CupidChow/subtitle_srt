1
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Someone died again.

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,520
This one is colored.

3
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,240
This paint.

4
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
There's paint on this.

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,680
Isn't this the symbol from "Ghost Blows Out the Light"?

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
This thing either targets those two directly,

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,400
or excludes those two directly.

8
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,880
Right.

9
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,000
So who else is left?

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,760
It's me.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
All the colleagues who worked overtime with me yesterday

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,320
have already turned into monsters.

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,120
This is real.

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
They're not extras.

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,720
So they've been infected by the virus.

16
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,360
Hurry, go!

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,080
Quick!

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,440
Get to the rooftop!

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,640
Get to the rooftop!

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
The subject carries the initial

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
infection source gene, individual A-Guai.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
After the final eight hours,

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
death occurs.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
The infected die completely.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,600
They lose their sanity.

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Their skin shows

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,520
they bite their own arms.

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,400
That is, at 8:30 in the evening,

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
by then, he has already turned into a monster.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,920
So if you really killed him with a hammer (or against the wall),

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,640
you're not the murderer.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,080
Right.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,720
The real murderer is the one who gave him this poison.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,280
Right.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Guys,

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
I think we should go

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
check out the third floor of the factory across the street.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,600
First, we need to rappel down.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Then there's a lift over there, right?

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,280
We need to rappel down.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
It's raining harder now.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,520
The sky has turned dark.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Let's quickly find a place to hide.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,800
Let's go out and take a look.

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
Let's go.

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Let's make it quick.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
The zombie is still there.

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,440
It has already spotted us.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Get down, quickly!

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,040
Get down.

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
How do we get across?

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
He’s attracting them.

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,760
This is also a zombie.

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
This is also a zombie.

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
This is a zombie.

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
How do you use this?

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
Try waking him up.

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,800
Wake him up.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
He’s a zombie, right?

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,920
Come on, time to work.

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
Find a way to wake him up.

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Get up.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,120
Get up.

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
Wake up.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Wait, I’ll distract them first.

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
Get up.

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Get up.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
Hurry, get up here.

69
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
I can hold on a bit longer.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
He’s still okay.

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,520
He’s not at the final stage.

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,080
Next one.

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
Only two people can go up at a time.

74
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,400
Ba.

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,520
Let Jin go up first.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,760
Ba.

77
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,160
Ba.

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Ba.

79
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,480
Next one.

80
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Hurry up.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
You two go up first.

82
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
How do we get up?

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
Let He operate it and take you up.

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,840
How does this work?

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
Step on it and push forward.

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,120
Push forward.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,760
Push forward.

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
Goodbye.

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,640
Goodbye, stay safe.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,920
Stay safe.

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,120
First level lift

92
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,320
Then the second level lift

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
Have you operated it before?

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,880
No, I haven't.

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
You're amazing.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Let's hide for now.

97
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Where should we hide?

98
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,320
Or should we just beat it to death?

99
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
We can physically hit its head.

100
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,640
Hit it.

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,800
No.

102
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,440
We can't do that.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Everyone else, hide.

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,120
Hide.

105
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
Hide.

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Mine is a bit too high.

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,680
Be careful.

108
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
It's possible that the place we're going

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
is the laboratory.

110
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,720
Right?

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,160
Right.

112
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Zombie laboratory.

113
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
Move it a bit to the right.

114
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
I feel like it's a bit dangerous.

115
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,680
How did they climb over the railing?

116
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,040
Why is it shaking?

117
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,960
Do they have to be really precise to get across?

118
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm watching.

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,520
It's fine, don't worry.

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
Move it to the right.

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, that's perfect.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,360
Perfect.

123
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
You can turn back now, it's fine.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,320
Go.

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
You're incredible.

126
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
Where is this?

127
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,920
Let's hide and wait for everyone to gather.

128
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
You guys go ahead.

129
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
You two go ahead.

130
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,880
The two of us?

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,600
Let's go.

132
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,600
Hang this up first.

133
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
Push it forward.

134
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Okay, lift to level one.

135
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Hurry up!

136
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
Hurry up!

137
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,720
Hello, everyone.

138
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Hello, everyone.

139
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,040
Welcome to our Tui City.

140
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,840
Tui City's video log.

141
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,280
That's right.

142
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
We're doing aerial filming now.

143
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,840
Let everyone take a look at our whole Tui City—

144
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
—building.

145
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Look over there.

146
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
There are two more people.

147
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,960
We're heading to the top of the mountain now.

148
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,920
Hold on.

149
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,840
Okay.

150
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Is he alright?

151
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,960
The two of them.

152
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,640
They're fine.

153
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,360
They're hiding.

154
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,120
Alright.

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
I'm filming the two of them.

156
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,280
You really gave in.

157
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,680
I really...

158
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,440
...am filming these two.

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Very happy.

160
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Let's take a look, there are two more over there.

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,800
Not at all leaving teammates...

162
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,640
...behind with that kind of sadness.

163
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Seriously.

164
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
We're almost there.

165
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
We're actually pretty fast.

166
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,400
Turn left.

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
You have a real talent.

168
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
Have you driven before?

169
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
I haven't.

170
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
My dream was actually to go to Lanxiang.

171
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
But I ended up going to New Oriental.

172
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,760
That's right, I studied to be a chef.

173
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
So what about him?

174
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,000
What about the assistant director?

175
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Assistant director, we'll come down in a bit.

176
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,640
Open the door on the first floor to let him in, right?

177
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,160
What about later?

178
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,760
What about that (single assistant director)?

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
We'll bring him up.

180
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Only two people can go up at a time.

181
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,160
Let's bring him along.

182
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,200
You take the director.

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,920
I've decided to stay with my zombie brothers.

184
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,280
Live and die together.

185
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,200
Because I already

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
got bitten, remember?

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,840
It's not nothing.

188
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,520
Ba got bitten too.

189
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,080
I don't mind.

190
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,240
It's not about minding or not.

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,040
I really don't mind.

192
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,640
I've mutated.

193
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I bit all of you.

194
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
It's okay.

195
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,160
I don't mind.

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,520
No.

197
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,360
I think it's time for me

198
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,760
to make a contribution to this team.

199
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,600
What do you mean?

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,400
Your smile is a bit sarcastic.

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
I thought about it.

202
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,400
You two go first.

203
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
I have to sacrifice myself.

204
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
Then I reflected on myself.

205
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I really haven't contributed much to the team.

206
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,600
So I have to force myself to make a contribution.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,920
Forced sacrifice.

208
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,360
No hardship to endure.

209
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
Yeah, no hardship to endure.

210
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,520
It seems like we're almost done.

211
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah.

212
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,040
Feels good now.

213
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,280
Don't.

214
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,960
Still, be careful.

215
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
Crawl in.

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,600
Okay.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,680
Okay.

218
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,280
Where are those two?

219
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
They've already left.

220
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,080
They just left.

221
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
We can go look for them first.

222
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,520
Okay.

223
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Let's discuss it.

224
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,840
We need to help him down.

225
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,000
It's hard for him to get down.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,120
The car is really slippery now.

227
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
You're tall.

228
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll go lure the "zombie."

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll carry him down.

230
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,120
Right.

231
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,440
Alright.

232
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,040
Hurry up.

233
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,720
Go save the boss (director).

234
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,120
Hurry and save the boss (director).

235
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,600
I'll go first.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,640
I'll go first.

237
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,680
I have to sacrifice myself.

238
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,360
Don't worry about me.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
Run!

240
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
Aren't you going up?

241
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll distract them here.

242
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,400
You two go up.

243
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,720
You're not going?

244
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm not going.

245
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm not going.

246
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,320
I have to dedicate myself to art.

247
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,880
This is my assistant director.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
Director Shan.

249
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
I've become the main director.

250
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
It wasn't easy for me to create this art.

251
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm too invested in it.

252
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,240
Sorry.

253
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
The theme of our play is

254
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,400
the end times.

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
A terrible infection has broken out.

256
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Those infected will turn into monsters.

257
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,760
Come on, darlings.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Move forward.

259
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
Sir, your sacrifice is noble.

260
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,880
We'll go up and find a way to save you.

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm about to be infected.

262
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,640
Sir's final act of heroism.

263
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,040
He drew the monsters away for all of us.

264
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,720
He himself

265
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,800
will eventually

266
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,360
turn into a monster too.

267
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,960
But he's still holding on right now.

268
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,160
Sir, your sacrifice is noble.

269
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Let's go.

270
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,440
You go in first.

271
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
It's so short.

272
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,320
So what?

273
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,640
Do you want me to make it three meters tall for you?

274
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
You’re here.

275
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
Where did you go just now?

276
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,319
We were hiding just now.

277
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
What’s this?

278
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,079
There’s food.

279
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,760
There’s food, right?

280
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,119
Take it. Take all of this.

281
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,319
What’s this?

282
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,920
My clothes.

283
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,960
This piece of clothing looks just like mine.

284
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,920
What?

285
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,560
The one I left in that other building.

286
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,359
Now there’s one here too.

287
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,000
This building also has a similar piece of clothing.

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
So does that mean there are others like us here?

289
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,600
No way.

290
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
Let’s not get sidetracked. Let’s go.

291
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
Let’s go.

292
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,880
There’s a window here.

293
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,320
This...

294
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Wait a second.

295
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
Here.

296
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Is there a room inside here?

297
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,600
That’s creepy.

298
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,000
What is this place?

299
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Who lives here?

300
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,200
We came from one building

301
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,840
and ran to another building.

302
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,520
So is this building their staff dormitory?

303
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,760
I don’t know.

304
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,400
But this doesn’t really look like a staff dormitory.

305
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,920
Look.

306
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
It looks like some kind of emergency shelter room.

307
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,120
Wait.

308
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
There are patient gowns here.

309
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,920
This is a place for experiments.

310
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,080
They were all injected with that vaccine here.

311
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,160
It's that virus.

312
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,440
Then we need to check when they started showing symptoms.

313
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,240
Look at the wall.

314
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
There are scratch marks.

315
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,480
There are signs of scratching.

316
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,680
This is the observation room.

317
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,480
It's possible.

318
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,000
What's this?

319
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
This is the clothing for psychiatric patients, right?

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Right.

321
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
The one used to restrain people.

322
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,880
I don't believe it can actually restrain someone.

323
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Come on, you go in and try it.

324
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
This should be yours, Lao Bai.

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,400
Is it you?

326
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,360
Just come on.

327
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,120
Is it you?

328
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,760
Come.

329
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,960
It's yours.

330
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,920
Yours.

331
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,160
So how do we prove it to you?

332
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,120
Shouldn't someone try it?

333
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,880
Yeah, I think so.

334
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,760
So who should try it?

335
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,000
I think the three of us have different heights.

336
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,240
It gets stuck here.

337
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,800
This is size L.

338
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
Okay.

339
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,400
Right.

340
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,520
Okay.

341
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,360
I believe it now.

342
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440
I suddenly believe it.

343
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
Can you squeeze through this?

344
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,280
Are you kidding?

345
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,000
Scare him to death.

346
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,360
So, let's investigate.

347
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,400
Can we search around here?

348
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
Let's search, come on, search.

349
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,680
Wait a second.

350
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,800
What?

351
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,600
Sticky.

352
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,800
There's blood.

353
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
There's blood on this.

354
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,800
What's on this?

355
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,480
Demon.

356
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,040
Melancholy.

357
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,760
Let me take a look.

358
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,040
Mom clearly promised me to use it.

359
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,320
Tongcheng Travel.

360
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
Take me out to play.

361
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
Why did she break her promise?

362
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,480
Aguai really misses Mom.

363
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
Wait, who is Aguai?

364
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,480
Aguai.

365
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,960
Who is Aguai?

366
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,120
I don't know.

367
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,320
What's that below?

368
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,360
Yes.

369
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
What?

370
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,760
Here.

371
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,080
Research reagent A.

372
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
B.

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
C.

374
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,400
What do A and C each stand for?

375
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,120
Research reagents A, B, and C.

376
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,160
All three test drugs have been tested.

377
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,440
Friends.

378
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,960
There are fairy tale books over here.

379
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,320
And then?

380
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Every fairy tale book has the name Aguai written on it.

381
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,800
There's a sentence on the book's cover page.

382
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,480
What sentence?

383
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
A very sad sentence.

384
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,120
They all have it.

385
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,120
They all have it.

386
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,440
The Shawshank Redemption

387
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,680
Prison break

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:47,960
Yes.

389
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,360
He dug his way out.

390
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
He might have been digging inside.

391
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,160
Because he broke a lot of spoons while digging.

392
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,840
That means there should be an exit here.

393
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,040
There must be.

394
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,120
Wait a second.

395
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,400
A trip hidden in WeChat

396
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,320
Set off

397
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,840
What does the arrow pointing down mean?

398
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,000
It's right at the head of the bed.

399
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,120
Can't this bed be lifted up?

400
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,000
What do you mean, set off?

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
Then it must mean set off here.

402
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,680
Yes.

403
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,840
Did you see this ladder?

404
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,480
This goes up, brother.

405
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes.

406
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,680
This goes up.

407
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,280
Yes, it has a ladder.

408
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,360
Watch your hands.

409
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520
Let go.

410
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
Take off the bed board, come on.

411
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,680
This is a ladder.

412
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,280
He made a ladder out of the bed frame.

413
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,960
It should go up.

414
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
It should lead upward.

415
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,360
Yes.

416
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
So it's possible.

417
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
We need to use this ladder to climb up.

418
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,160
Right?

419
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Right.

420
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,080
Let's lift it up and take a look first.

421
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,760
Okay.

422
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,040
It can be pushed up.

423
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes, be careful not to pinch your hand.

424
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,520
Three, two, one

425
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,280
Okay

426
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,800
So cool

427
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
Thanks to Tongcheng Travel's puzzle-solving help

428
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,600
Otherwise, how could we have found

429
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,360
this secret passage?

430
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,200
Yes, Tongcheng Travel is like a dream-making airship

431
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,880
always ready to carry everyone's travel dreams

432
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,640
Aguai must be full of curiosity and longing

433
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,040
for the outside world

434
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,000
That's why he used Tongcheng Travel's

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Fei'er Meng as a treasure hunt marker

436
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,800
Yes

437
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
The regret of not being able to travel with his mom

438
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,760
must still be hidden in his heart

439
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,160
So

440
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
we have to seize the moment

441
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,960
Tongcheng is you and me

442
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,920
Quick, open the WeChat service

443
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,560
and find

444
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
the ticket booking

445
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
Hardcore low prices can't be hidden

446
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,920
Let's set off together with Tongcheng

447
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,400
So this is from someone called Aguai

448
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
Did he want to escape from here?

449
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,080
It's possible

450
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,400
Wait, let's look at these clothes

451
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Is there a name on the clothes?

452
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,160
Is there any information here?

453
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
These are children's clothes

454
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,720
So this person was locked in here

455
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
from childhood to adulthood

456
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
That's so cruel

457
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,040
So who is this Aguai?

458
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
So in here

459
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,040
is there someone

460
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,520
who grew up here since childhood?

461
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
It's possible

462
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,840
Let's go look

463
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,760
How did I let you go first?

464
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,280
You want me to let you.

465
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,440
Are you really letting us go first?

466
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,200
Let's do it.

467
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
I didn't expect it to be this dangerous.

468
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,720
It's fine.

469
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,880
Hurry up, Bai.

470
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
Wait, hold on.

471
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Hurry up.

472
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,520
No one's here.

473
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
Someone's here.

474
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,160
There really is someone.

475
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,280
Let Bai go.

476
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,840
Let him go in front.

477
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,560
You want me to go first.

478
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,160
Hurry up.

479
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,880
I'm speechless.

480
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
Why did you make it this difficult?

481
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll go up first.

482
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
Go.

483
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,560
It's fine, it's safe.

484
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,280
No need to hold me.

485
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
This is to latch on.

486
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Let's go.

487
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,320
If you don't go, there's no space.

488
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,920
Are you going up first?

489
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
You go.

490
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,680
I'll go last.

491
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,800
There are so many shovels here.

492
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,680
What is he digging with the shovel?

493
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,120
The shovel probably dug this tunnel.

494
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
Is this a tunnel?

495
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,440
This is a vent.

496
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,120
Skylight.

497
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,400
This

498
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
See if there's anything here

499
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,200
like a lamp or something

500
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
There's a floor cushion here

501
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,600
This

502
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,360
is impressive

503
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
Who lives here?

504
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
No idea

505
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,360
It's all blood

506
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Blood-stained gauze

507
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,320
And this thing for eating

508
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,080
There's also a lunchbox

509
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,040
It's obvious someone was hiding from this

510
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
So it must be that one from before

511
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,600
The one trapped inside, A Guai

512
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,840
A Guai's secret base

513
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,600
This

514
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,160
Come

515
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,640
Let's see what's on the computer

516
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,600
There's something in the computer

517
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
A page from the Tuixiaoba forum

518
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,960
And the username here is Jin Pengyou

519
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,800
Verified as "Pengyou"

520
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
That's my friend

521
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,920
Chat

522
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
You can click it open

523
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,240
January 1, 2020

524
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,560
Jinquan Princess said

525
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,040
My name is Jinquan Princess

526
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,240
Are you also applying to Tuiyi?

527
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,000
Jin Pengyou said yes

528
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,680
I found some past Tuiyi exam questions

529
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
I'll share them with you

530
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,520
Three years of art exams, five years of Tuiyi

531
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,880
Jinquan Princess is you

532
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,360
It's you, right?

533
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes

534
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
I've always said I want to get into Tuiyi University

535
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
It was almost time for the college entrance exam then

536
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,520
Then I met a friend online

537
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,160
His name is Jin Pengyou

538
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
So annoying.

539
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
Exams are really stressful.

540
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
There are endless exercises to do every day.

541
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
And endless exams to take.

542
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,080
I really don't want to take exams.

543
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm so tired.

544
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,840
So tired.

545
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,560
This shows you're working hard for your future.

546
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,040
You're so outstanding, just hang in there a bit longer.

547
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,520
Do you ever get stressed about exams?

548
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,240
Exams? I'm okay with them.

549
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,760
Not much pressure.

550
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,840
It's just that I've run into some things lately.

551
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,640
I don't really know how to talk about it.

552
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,000
What's wrong?

553
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,840
There shouldn't be secrets between friends.

554
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,680
If you don't want to tell me,

555
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,560
I'll be really sad.

556
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,640
It would mean you don't see me as a friend.

557
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,120
Alright.

558
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,400
I've noticed that some secrets I tell my friends

559
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
they turn around and share with others.

560
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,520
As if it's just a joke.

561
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
Your friends have friends too.

562
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,880
Friends should be open with each other.

563
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,600
They share your stories

564
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
with their friends, it's normal.

565
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
They're definitely not doing it out of malice.

566
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,840
Just like I am with you.

567
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,160
You can tell me anything.

568
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,960
Alright.

569
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,120
I got my admission letter from Tuiyi.

570
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,000
And I also got my driver's license.

571
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,120
Let's meet up this evening.

572
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,440
I'll drive my precious new car.

573
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,520
I'll take you for a drive to Tiebu Mountain.

574
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,240
I'll take my best friend up the mountain.

575
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,200
We'll go for a drive and have some fun.

576
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
Congratulations! See you tonight, don't be late.

577
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
I can finally see you, it's rare.

578
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,720
There's one more.

579
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
Tuihao.

580
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,040
Who is Tuihao?

581
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
I don't know.

582
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Jin Pengyou said Tuihao.

583
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,280
Tuihao, the weather is really nice today.

584
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,920
What's so nice about it?

585
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,200
I can barely finish my homework.

586
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
My parents want me to get first place.

587
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,520
But this time I got second place.

588
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,640
Do you think I'm a bad person?

589
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,120
Of course not.

590
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
You're already amazing.

591
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,440
Not getting first place once in a while

592
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,800
doesn't mean you're a failure.

593
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
Thank you.

594
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,000
It rained today and I slipped in the mud.

595
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,480
Why am I so unlucky?

596
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,160
Rain is great.

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,520
The air isn't so dry anymore.

598
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,600
Next time, wear super non-slip shoes.

599
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Then you definitely won't fall.

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Tuihao says you're really thoughtful.

601
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,080
Tuihao.

602
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
He's also someone from Tuiyi.

603
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,080
I received the admission letter from Tuiyi.

604
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,200
Then Jin Pengyou said congratulations.

605
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Congratulations.

606
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,960
And then on what date was it?

607
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,600
After August 1st.

608
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
Starting from January 1st, 2020.

609
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,800
We didn't contact each other for four months.

610
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,760
Why?

611
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,520
It's because Jin Pengyou died.

612
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,680
He was killed by her.

613
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Read the rest.

614
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,000
How have you been lately?

615
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,880
It's been a long time since you replied.

616
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,600
I don't know how you've been.

617
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,240
I met a new friend on Tuiyi.

618
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,200
He told me a lot about his troubles.

619
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,760
I treat him the way you treated me back then.

620
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,320
I hope he can be happy every day.

621
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
I hope he doesn't carry such a heavy burden in his heart.

622
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,000
Are you doing well?

623
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,240
I look forward to meeting you again.

624
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
On this August 1st,

625
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
after we finished our last conversation,

626
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,520
there was nothing after that.

627
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,760
There's also an artbook.

628
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,040
What's drawn in that artbook?

629
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
The artbook is probably about when Aguai met

630
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,640
a friend.

631
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,560
The friend appeared in 2020,

632
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,800
on August 16th.

633
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
It seems the friend was injured.

634
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,880
Then asked, "What's your name?"

635
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,240
And it was still August 16th.

636
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
He said, "So you're the same age as me."

637
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,400
"I'm eighteen this year."

638
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
"Thank you for saving me."

639
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
So this injured friend and Aguai

640
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,520
are both eighteen.

641
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,240
Then the third page says, "My friends abandoned me."

642
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
"I was 'sent' here by my friends."

643
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,800
It's about this injured person.

644
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,160
There was a mountain, and he fell down.

645
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Right.

646
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
The injured person told Aguai,

647
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,560
"Aguai, you said every time you go out,

648
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,600
your dad always catches you and brings you back."

649
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,720
"Your dad is so scary."

650
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
It was September 12th.

651
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
It was Aguai's dad

652
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,120
who caught him to do experiments.

653
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,840
Then Tui Town Art Academy

654
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,600
In July, I received an offer from the directing program at Tui Art Academy

655
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,280
an admission letter

656
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,200
That was the school I longed for the most

657
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,480
the top art school

658
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to go there

659
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,400
Then he said, after I recover

660
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,560
we'll go see the scenery together

661
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,160
On September 18, 2020, it was all gone

662
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,840
Okay

663
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,440
So that means

664
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
the one who got hurt was Jin, your friend

665
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,000
Yes

666
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,520
After your friend fell

667
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,120
he was found by someone named A-Guai

668
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,400
and was saved

669
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes

670
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,960
Because he lives here

671
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,560
Yes

672
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,440
He lives here

673
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,320
And below that is A-Guai's place

674
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,920
On the paper we found yesterday

675
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,280
what was written on it?

676
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,040
Does anyone remember more specifically?

677
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,720
I was harmed back then

678
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,440
Yes

679
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,160
I fell off the cliff at Tiebu Mountain

680
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,760
I treated you as a friend, but you hurt me

681
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,280
Now, life is worse than death

682
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,560
I saw you as a friend, but you betrayed me

683
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,200
I want revenge

684
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,240
That piece of paper belongs to Jin's friend.

685
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,080
Because there's blood all over here.

686
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,400
There's blood on that paper too.

687
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,360
Right.

688
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
That paper is Jin's friend.

689
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
So the one with red hair yesterday

690
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,800
is Jin's friend.

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,120
Is your friend male or female?

692
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,240
Male.

693
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,080
Then it should be him.

694
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,520
So Jin's friend wants to kill me.

695
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,840
He wants to get revenge on you.

696
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,480
It must be one of us.

697
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,520
He knows my friend isn't dead yet.

698
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,600
After I saw this paper,

699
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,720
I had to kill him.

700
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
So I killed my friend.

701
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,320
I'm the murderer.

702
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,280
But I have an alibi.

703
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,320
Because I'm a livestream star on Weibo.

704
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,400
People all over the world can vouch for me.

705
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,480
So among the five of you,

706
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,080
the murderer

707
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,240
Actually, you killed the wrong person.

708
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,120
Why did you kill my friend?

709
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,280
Who has anything to do with your friend?

710
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,160
Who could possibly be connected?

711
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,080
No one is connected to my friend.

712
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,680
Because everyone

713
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,920
had their own friend killed.

714
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,480
That's impossible.

715
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,840
Then someone must be connected to your friend.

716
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Then either

717
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,840
this person will come back to kill you,

718
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,480
and someone wants to protect you.

719
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,960
Who wants to protect me?

720
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,720
The answer is obvious.

721
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,280
Then there's only this one.

722
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,160
Who else?

723
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Who will protect me?

724
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,440
That "hopeless romantic."

725
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,320
Yesterday, it was the killer.

726
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,640
Today, it's the killer again.

727
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,920
You never learn.

728
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
How much do you really love me?

729
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,560
Who else?

730
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,680
Who still loves me?

731
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,160
Actually, I don't love you.

732
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,920
Just kidding.

733
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
I'll just lock in the killer.

734
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,320
You won't.

735
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
This logic is definitely

736
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,320
missing something, there's a flaw in it.

737
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,360
Something's off.

738
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,880
This logic is a bit messy.

739
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,520
This logic is a bit messy.

740
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,440
Yeah, it's really messy.

741
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,160
It's a bit messy.

742
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,800
So if the killer saw what was written on the notice,

743
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,720
they might think their friend came back to kill them.

744
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
He might think, "Is he my friend?"

745
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
Came back to kill me.

746
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Mistakenly thought he came to kill him.

747
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Right.

748
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
But when you see this person,

749
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,200
you know he's not my friend.

750
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,840
Right, so why the misunderstanding?

751
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,160
You don't recognize your friend.

752
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,080
We all know him.

753
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,400
So the logic is,

754
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,639
He didn't...

755
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,239
He hit that thing to make him fall.

756
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
It's not like I stabbed you while looking at your face.

757
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Didn't see anyone.

758
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,400
Didn't see.

759
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,480
He didn't see anyone.

760
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,199
How did he see that flyer?

761
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
I don't know if my theory is correct.

762
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Let me explain my theory first.

763
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:27,760
Okay.

764
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,520
It's this piece of paper.

765
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
It's actually Jin's admission letter.

766
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,639
Right.

767
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,199
Then Jin was pushed off the cliff by you.

768
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,159
I want to get revenge on you.

769
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,480
Yes.

770
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,639
At that time, I was here recovering from my injuries.

771
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,600
One day, my injury suddenly healed.

772
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,000
I got up, ready to take revenge.

773
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,760
But about this revenge...

774
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
When I went down to steal clothes,

775
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
the admission letter fell.

776
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,679
Someone must have seen it.

777
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,880
Or maybe found out, or something like that.

778
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,239
I don't know.

779
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,120
That's right.

780
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,639
No matter what his motive was,

781
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,360
whether he wanted to protect you,

782
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,880
or saw this and thought...

783
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,440
thought that Jin was his friend.

784
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,000
I understand, what I mean is

785
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,520
this killer

786
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
how did they, without seeing Jin's friend

787
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,640
without seeing her face

788
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,440
just by seeing this flyer, deduce

789
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,160
that the person who returned is my friend

790
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I know what she's saying

791
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
even with your logic

792
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
even if this person saw the flyer

793
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,840
and wanted to protect her

794
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,440
or wanted to kill this person

795
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,040
he still wouldn't know who to kill

796
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,320
why, just by seeing this flyer

797
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
would he want to kill Jin's friend?

798
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,680
That's right.

799
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,760
Go ahead, I'm listening.

800
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,600
Here's the thing.

801
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Didn't we also see

802
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,920
that Polaroid photo?

803
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,520
It showed that someone had already taken a picture

804
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,360
of the red-haired person's back.

805
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,040
Right.

806
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
And then?

807
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,440
Then it was said that

808
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,560
he looked a lot like

809
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,840
what someone looks like after being infected.

810
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,600
Eight hours later,

811
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,160
they die.

812
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,280
The infected person dies completely.

813
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,040
They lose their sanity.

814
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,000
Red patterns appear on their skin.

815
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,600
They bite their own arm.

816
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
And if you add his timeline to that,

817
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,440
those top extras saw him

818
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
on the night of the 22nd,

819
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,280
before 8:30 PM.

820
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,520
He bit his right elbow.

821
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,600
A little after 8 PM,

822
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,040
he was already biting himself.

823
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,320
And that photo was also taken at 8:30.

824
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,840
So actually, before he was

825
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,280
crushed or stabbed to death,

826
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,560
he was already

827
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
brain dead.

828
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,560
That's right.

829
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,560
Exactly.

830
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,040
Yes.

831
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,880
Yes.

832
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,160
He was no longer human.

833
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,520
Right.

834
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,480
Right.

835
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Is it possible that the victim

836
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,840
had already turned into a monster

837
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
and then attacked the killer?

838
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,080
And then was killed in return by the killer?

839
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,440
What does that mean?

840
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
So there are two killers again?

841
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,280
If that's the case,

842
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,520
there's actually only one killer.

843
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
The one who was infected.

844
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,000
Who smashed the stairs?

845
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
I think we can accept this.

846
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,720
Because from that note, we've already confirmed

847
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,680
that what you killed wasn't

848
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,240
a human anymore.

849
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,480
You can totally jump today.

850
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
You really can jump today.

851
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,960
It's really smart for you to jump out now.

852
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,960
There's paint on it.

853
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,520
Just lock in the culprit.

854
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,400
He, go ahead and jump.

855
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,480
The reason this person isn't jumping

856
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
is because the one who poisoned earlier was also him.

857
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,200
But that's basically impossible.

858
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,920
Impossible.

859
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,560
Right.

860
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,400
Like this.

861
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,240
I'm deducing.

862
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Everyone, close your eyes.

863
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,680
Everyone, close your eyes.

864
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,360
Okay.

865
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,240
Close them.

866
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
The person who knocked on the wall,

867
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
you secretly open your eyes.

868
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
I won't say anything, okay?

869
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,640
I won't tell, okay?

870
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
Alright.

871
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,480
Alright.

872
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,160
Okay.

873
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,280
Only she knows.

874
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,320
Only I know.

875
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,960
I won't say.

876
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,600
Alright, three,

877
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,400
two,

878
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,120
one.

879
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
This either directly points to those two,

880
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,480
or directly rules them out.

881
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
I think we can accept this.

882
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,520
We've already confirmed it from that paper.

883
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
You didn't just kill one person.

884
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,000
It's really smart of you to reveal yourself now.

885
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,400
Open your eyes.

886
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,160
What do you mean?

887
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,520
That person has already opened their eyes now, right?

888
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,680
Okay, open your eyes.

889
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,000
All done, right?

890
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,240
No one opened their eyes.

891
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,880
No one will open their eyes.

892
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,280
She's protecting that person, I know.

893
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,880
I know who it is.

894
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,920
Alright, let's go down. Next step.

895
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,360
Go.

896
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,560
You.

897
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Let's go.

898
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,440
You.

899
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,160
Smiling like that...

900
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,920
Yeah.

901
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,680
So ambiguous.

902
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,240
The Shawshank Redemption, I'm telling you.

903
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,120
The hole they dug.

904
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Then let's go down.

905
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,080
Let's go.

906
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,280
Don't be nervous.

907
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
All I can say is,

908
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
today was really amazing.

909
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,000
You guys need to be careful.

910
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,040
These stairs are a bit steep.

911
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,800
This is really high.

912
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,200
Be careful.

913
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Wait a second.

914
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Be careful.

915
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,120
Hold on carefully, grab both sides.

916
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,200
Need some help?

917
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,680
Help me, carry me down.

918
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,320
Jump down.

919
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,360
No rush.

920
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,960
Take it slow.

921
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,800
What was that sound?

922
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
The prince on a white horse mutated.

923
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,280
What?

924
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,520
So cool.

925
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,240
Private laboratory.

926
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,760
That's right.

927
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,800
This is the place where they make zombies.

928
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,640
Right? Technically speaking.

929
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
That's so scary.

930
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,840
There's a big boss in here.

931
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,520
You have to go meet him.

932
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,080
Here.

933
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,040
Inside here.

934
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,680
I've already been bitten.

935
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,880
I'll lock myself up.

936
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,040
Run!

937
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,600
I think we should listen to him.

938
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,240
Seriously.

939
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,160
Yeah.

940
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,000
It's over.

941
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,880
Security verification passage.

942
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,800
Only one person can pass at a time.

943
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
Only one person is allowed through at a time.

944
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,840
We're done for.

945
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,760
It's single file again.

946
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,000
Stop it.

947
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
I'm begging you.

948
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,760
Don't do this.

949
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,600
I'll go first.

950
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,800
There should be an order, right?

951
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,040
See if there's another exit.

952
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,720
Head to the fire escape.

953
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Are we escaping in here?

954
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Are you kidding?

955
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Head to that building.

956
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,120
Elevator.

957
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,360
Go outside.

958
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,480
Here.

959
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,600
You can go down here.

960
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:30,680
Wait.

961
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,760
There should be zombies here.

962
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,680
They'll rush out soon.

963
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,080
No, wait.

964
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,120
What if there are some in the elevator?

965
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I've already pressed it.

966
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,160
Then I'll go in first.

967
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,080
Wait.

968
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,680
What's wrong?

969
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,360
What are you doing?

970
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,320
What about him?

971
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,160
You're really bad.

972
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,400
You even closed the door.

973
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,240
Aren't you just the worst?

974
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,240
Ke was bitten.

975
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,480
Come on, hurry!

976
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,600
Throw something.

977
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,800
Hurry up and throw something.

978
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,280
Lure them away.

979
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Move aside.

980
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,040
Move aside.

981
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,600
Where is he?

982
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,320
Where is he?

983
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,240
Ke.

984
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,400
Hurry!

985
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,280
He.

986
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,040
You're scared.

987
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,680
No.

988
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,080
As soon as the elevator doors opened,

989
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,880
there was a crowd of people.

990
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,600
Then I saw a tightly locked door nearby.

991
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,440
And when I was "alive,"

992
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,160
I saw the face of my best friend.

993
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,960
Lab supervisor

994
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,320
Please use facial recognition to open the door

995
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,080
So should we go this way?

996
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,160
To enter the lab

997
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,480
Scan your face

998
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,880
Hurry, everyone scan once

999
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Maybe one of us is the culprit

1000
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,280
That's right

1001
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,400
It didn't open

1002
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,760
Let me try

1003
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,520
You're so handsome

1004
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,320
Thank you

1005
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,440
It didn't open

1006
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,360
It must be him, I don't even have to think

1007
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,280
You've already received from me

1008
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,680
A permanent villain card

1009
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,720
Why is it me?

1010
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,840
Aren't we supposed to scan our faces?

1011
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,680
So handsome

1012
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,800
You're so beautiful

1013
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,400
So good-looking

1014
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,880
It didn't open

1015
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,520
No

1016
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,480
Your face looks like it has a story

1017
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,640
So handsome

1018
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,280
Scan the supervisor's face

1019
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,680
How could this not work?

1020
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,200
Wait a second

1021
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,880
Should we try the one outside?

1022
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,520
Is he inside?

1023
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,520
Over there

1024
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,080
I see him

1025
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,640
I see him too

1026
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,200
He's over there

1027
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,120
This one

1028
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,280
The one in the white coat

1029
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,600
How do we pull him out?

1030
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,760
Like this.

1031
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,040
We need to cut off that person's head.

1032
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,880
Bring it over to brush.

1033
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,280
What?

1034
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,600
No, just kidding.

1035
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,760
What is this?

1036
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,600
What is this?

1037
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,800
Wrap this around yourself.

1038
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,520
Can we go out?

1039
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,440
The "zombies" won't know who you are.

1040
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,400
Is this invisibility?

1041
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,440
Is this invisibility?

1042
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,080
Invisibility cloak.

1043
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,520
You go.

1044
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,120
Pull him out.

1045
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,360
What you have now is an invisibility cloak.

1046
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,760
I can't even see you now.

1047
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Is this invisibility?

1048
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,400
This is invisibility.

1049
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,240
This is really invisibility.

1050
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,200
You do it.

1051
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,480
You go out.

1052
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,160
Take this. Got it.

1053
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,360
Put him inside.

1054
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,080
No.

1055
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,320
You have to wear it like this and walk.

1056
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,720
After walking all the way, cover it up.

1057
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,920
Once the person passes through, cover it.

1058
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,520
Then those people can't catch you.

1059
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,920
You won't get infected.

1060
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
Like this.

1061
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,720
Like this.

1062
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
No, you'll still get bitten like this.

1063
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,160
What about my legs?

1064
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,360
If I snap at you, won't you get bitten?

1065
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,240
No, I just squat and walk like this.

1066
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,200
Then how do you find him?

1067
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,440
How do you get him inside?

1068
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,440
Right, you can't even see the road.

1069
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,200
Yeah.

1070
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,720
Or one person goes to draw their attention.

1071
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,480
Then another person

1072
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,880
goes to bring that person back.

1073
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:46,800
Go.

1074
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,720
No, we definitely have to go in.

1075
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,560
I'll be in charge of opening the door.

1076
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,320
You're in charge of opening the door.

1077
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,200
Such ambition.

1078
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,000
Wait, it's too heavy.

1079
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,440
I can't get in, that's the main thing.

1080
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,320
I'm stuck.

1081
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,520
Your head is so big.

1082
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,440
How about we just

1083
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,800
roll a barrel over there first?

1084
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,000
Because they follow sounds.

1085
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,640
Let's make some noise.

1086
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,320
Then lure that person over.

1087
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,520
How about that?

1088
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,600
I got it.

1089
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,560
I have a great idea.

1090
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,680
First, if the barrel is sealed, it's invincible.

1091
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,160
Right?

1092
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,600
Right.

1093
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,640
In that case,

1094
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,800
send out a sealed barrel.

1095
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,560
He's inside.

1096
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,200
Attract them.

1097
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,440
After they all gather around,

1098
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,400
the five of us

1099
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,320
while their backs are turned,

1100
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
just grab that person.

1101
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,360
Let's search together.

1102
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,960
Two or three of us will go out to look.

1103
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,280
Yeah, no problem.

1104
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,760
Then one person holds the door.

1105
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,600
After pulling him over,

1106
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,240
someone closes the door.

1107
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,560
Then we scan our faces.

1108
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,240
Then call him back.

1109
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,280
Push this person out.

1110
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,000
That's right.

1111
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,880
In the end, the person in the barrel

1112
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,920
is left outside to die.

1113
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,000
Wait a moment, you take it down first.

1114
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,440
Take it down first.

1115
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
I'm exhausted.

1116
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,280
Wait a moment, let's rest for a while.

1117
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,520
Let's first make a plan.

1118
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,880
I feel it's time for me to contribute to this team.

1119
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,280
Make some contributions.

1120
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,360
Okay.

1121
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,720
These two are up to you two.

1122
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,160
You two go out and distract.

1123
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,560
Then we'll go out and catch them.

1124
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,560
You two are responsible for guarding the door.

1125
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:07,960
Okay.

1126
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,320
Alright?

1127
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,920
Okay.

1128
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,960
Alright.

1129
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
Which one? Wait a moment.

1130
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,120
Which one? Tell me.

1131
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,480
Wait, let's identify it first.

1132
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,720
There, over there.

1133
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,360
That's the one.

1134
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,800
The one by the left corner of the wall, see it?

1135
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,000
The one wearing the white robe.

1136
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,880
He should be about 1.7 meters tall.

1137
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,800
I see him, I see him.

1138
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,600
That's him.

1139
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,680
Let them go out first.

1140
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,320
Right.

1141
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,640
It's okay.

1142
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,280
Okay.

1143
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,480
Go out and lock it directly.

1144
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,360
Good luck to you.

1145
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,680
Open.

1146
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,160
I'm the shield, open.

1147
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,240
I'm doing this for you.

1148
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,720
I'll keep attracting them there.

1149
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,040
Open.

1150
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,840
Go.

1151
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,080
The door.

1152
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,520
Wait a moment.

1153
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,600
Which way should we go?

1154
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,800
Stay here, look at me.

1155
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,320
I'm going to die laughing.

1156
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,080
What should we do?

1157
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,160
Why isn't it working?

1158
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,080
It's not working.

1159
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,680
No, it won't work.

1160
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,320
It's not working.

1161
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,560
This method is wrong.

1162
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,920
Then what should we do?

1163
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,640
So what now?

1164
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,480
Call them back first.

1165
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,880
Come here.

1166
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,720
You two, come back first.

1167
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,320
How can we come back now?

1168
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,640
Just come back first.

1169
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,120
Come back.

1170
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,320
Okay.

1171
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,720
I don't think this is right.

1172
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,760
This method we're using now

1173
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,840
probably isn't correct.

1174
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,240
You two

1175
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Both of you, come back first.

1176
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,920
You two didn't attract them.

1177
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,080
They're not looking for you.

1178
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,360
Come back first.

1179
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,480
Are you tired?

1180
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,720
I'm okay.

1181
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Something's not right.

1182
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
What do you mean?

1183
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,680
Just now,

1184
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,400
we thought

1185
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,720
they would keep surrounding your two barrels.

1186
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,520
But after we went out,

1187
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,160
they were still banging on our door.

1188
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,600
Why didn't it work?

1189
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,520
It didn't work.

1190
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,120
We couldn't get around them at all.

1191
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,840
Take this, and do it like this.

1192
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,560
Like this.

1193
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,600
Push them all away.

1194
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,040
Can this open all the way?

1195
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,720
Ke, this won't work.

1196
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,920
Fit a person inside.

1197
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,000
Right, my head comes out from there.

1198
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,440
That works.

1199
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,080
What do you mean?

1200
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,840
Stand inside, then you can move.

1201
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,080
I'll chase them while wearing it.

1202
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,440
I think that's brilliant.

1203
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,200
Brilliant.

1204
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,880
Brilliant.

1205
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,960
You'll still get bitten.

1206
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,320
Will you still get bitten like this?

1207
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,280
Yes, you'll get bitten.

1208
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,600
Wait a second.

1209
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,360
You need to see how many people are outside.

1210
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,440
If they all come at once,

1211
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,280
if they rush up like this, you can't do anything.

1212
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,600
This can only push them away for a moment.

1213
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,280
Yeah.

1214
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,640
I think if we do this,

1215
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,400
then we can...

1216
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,800
Let's just

1217
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,320
take two shields and force our way out.

1218
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,240
Each of us takes one.

1219
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,760
We'll protect the one in the middle who's grabbing the person.

1220
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,200
Lao Bai, you go grab the person, we'll cover you.

1221
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,600
I've decided to put on my invisibility cloak.

1222
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,600
Let's go out and take them on.

1223
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,200
Let's go.

1224
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,920
We'll protect you all the way.

1225
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Here's what we'll do: you stand here first.

1226
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,200
Right, you stand in the middle.

1227
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,400
We'll move along the wall.

1228
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,800
After we get out, go left first.

1229
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,080
The two of us will keep holding up like this.

1230
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,680
Right.

1231
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,240
Then, when you get to the end,

1232
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,040
you just pull him over.

1233
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,800
Just grab him and pull him over.

1234
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,400
You need to think about this.

1235
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,640
After you pull him in,

1236
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,200
how will you protect him?

1237
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,120
You can't let those two...

1238
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,800
I'll let him bite me.

1239
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,920
Because I've already been bitten once.

1240
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,280
It doesn't matter.

1241
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,840
Okay, then let him bite you.

1242
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,920
Bring him back while he's biting you.

1243
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,640
I'll just use my finger...

1244
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,800
Bring him back while he's biting.

1245
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
Bring him back while he's biting.

1246
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,080
Like this, holding onto your finger.

1247
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,720
Like this, holding onto your finger.

1248
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,200
Okay.

1249
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,000
Let's go.

1250
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:17,960
Open.

1251
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,680
Ready, three, two, one, go!

1252
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,560
Go!

1253
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,920
Go!

1254
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,560
Go!

1255
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,160
Go!

1256
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,480
Over there

1257
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,480
Ning

1258
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,360
Ning

1259
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,000
Give me this

1260
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,960
Hurry up

1261
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,720
Quick, push him away

1262
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,000
Where is it

1263
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,960
There

1264
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,520
That one

1265
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,200
This

1266
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,280
Quick, come and control it

1267
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,960
Come

1268
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,080
Here

1269
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,120
Here

1270
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,520
Yes, this

1271
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,160
This

1272
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,000
Control it

1273
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,600
This

1274
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,920
Sweep

1275
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,800
Teacher, you can't reach it

1276
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,560
Stop biting their necks

1277
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,840
You can't reach it

1278
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,320
Lift it up

1279
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,880
It's open

1280
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,200
It's open

1281
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
There's cloth

1282
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,280
He tore it off

1283
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,600
His clothes should be

1284
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,760
an extra's costume

1285
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,640
Looks a bit like it

1286
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,320
So that's his child

1287
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,720
2024

1288
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,800
Outstanding Graduate Commemorative Bracelet from Tuiyi

1289
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,560
It's open.

1290
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,040
Go.

1291
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,400
Only one person can go through at a time.

1292
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,320
Only one person at a time.

1293
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,240
He has to scan.

1294
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,160
Scan six times.

1295
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,880
So who goes first?

1296
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,520
You go first.

1297
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,720
I'll go ahead first.

1298
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,680
It's fine, you go.

1299
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,800
You're the main force.

1300
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,680
Because someone has to control him from behind.

1301
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,840
It's fine, you guys go.

1302
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,400
I've already been bitten eighty times.

1303
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,680
You guys go.

1304
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,480
It's definitely safe in here.

1305
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,160
Trust me.

1306
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,600
It's really fine.

1307
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,920
Then you go.

1308
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,680
It's really fine.

1309
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,440
It's fine, you go.

1310
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:13,760
Go first.

1311
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,600
I'll go, come on.

1312
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,640
It's closed.

1313
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:24,960
Gone.

1314
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,720
Next.

1315
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,560
One of us.

1316
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,520
One of us, come on.

1317
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,680
Three, two, one, go.

1318
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,960
Go.

1319
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,480
It's open.

1320
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,200
It's open.

1321
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,040
I'm leaving. I'm going.

1322
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,840
Okay, let's go again.

1323
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,960
Three, two, one, go.

1324
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,760
Go.

1325
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,640
It's open.

1326
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,840
It's open.

1327
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,720
Go.

1328
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,240
Then I have a question.

1329
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,880
What about the last person?

1330
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,640
Don't worry about me.

1331
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,280
You carry him up, then go.

1332
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Then you just go your own way.

1333
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,520
At critical moments, you still have to rely on me, right?

1334
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,440
Okay.

1335
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,880
I want to.

1336
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,760
Okay, bro, okay.

1337
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,480
Okay.

1338
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,000
Swipe it again.

1339
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,520
Go.

1340
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
I'm leaving.

1341
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,520
Goodbye.

1342
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,800
Farewell forever.

1343
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,600
Farewell forever.

1344
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,200
It won't be forever.

1345
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,520
Think of a way yourself.

1346
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,080
Pull him.

1347
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,280
For you all,

1348
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,760
I'll stay there to distract them.

1349
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,680
It's fine, you guys go.

1350
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,680
I've already been bitten eighty times.

1351
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,960
You guys go.

1352
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,040
I can't lift him.

1353
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,560
Okay.

1354
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,760
Come on.

1355
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,560
Can you turn on the light here?

1356
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,120
Where did the three of them go?

1357
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,080
Weren't you the first one to come in?

1358
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,520
No.

1359
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,480
She was the second.

1360
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,280
Where are they?

1361
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,520
Who was the third?

1362
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,240
After you came in just now,

1363
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,280
didn't you see Ba come in?

1364
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,320
No, she didn't come in.

1365
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,480
Can this still be opened?

1366
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,120
It can't be opened anymore.

1367
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,640
It can't be opened anymore.

1368
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,600
Then where did they go?

1369
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,800
Ba.

1370
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,440
Where would the three of them go?

1371
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,880
Wait, were they infected?

1372
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,480
It seems so.

1373
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,120
I just saw a note.

1374
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,040
It said,

1375
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,160
Infected people can't get through.

1376
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,640
Because Ba was bitten, right?

1377
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,960
But was Ke bitten?

1378
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,000
When he was in the elevator just now,

1379
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,560
he was surrounded.

1380
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,000
He must have been bitten.

1381
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,920
I was bitten.

1382
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,800
It's your fault Ke got bitten.

1383
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,920
You locked him outside.

1384
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
He could be the bad guy.

1385
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,040
I'm telling you,

1386
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,800
he is

1387
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,680
the killer.

1388
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,640
I'm the killer.

1389
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,080
It's me.

1390
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,600
Say it again, are you the killer?

1391
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,320
No.

1392
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,280
At this very moment,

1393
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,560
if we put a detective here,

1394
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,440
one of us must be the killer.

1395
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,000
Who do you think it is?

1396
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,160
Classic either-or choice.

1397
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,800
I think it's you.

1398
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,160
I think it's you.

1399
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,160
What's the point?

1400
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,480
What's the point?

1401
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,480
Alright, let's keep looking.

1402
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,360
Greenhouse.

1403
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,920
This is locked.

1404
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,800
Research reagents.

1405
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,880
A is sour, B is spicy.

1406
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,040
Bitter, sour.

1407
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,320
Friends,

1408
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,760
Research File, Phase Two

1409
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,600
Botanical agents can suppress the monsterization mechanism.

1410
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,840
Agents A, B, and C

1411
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,240
can only suppress viral activity.

1412
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
They slow down the actions of the infected.

1413
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,320
Develop Agent D

1414
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,400
It can effectively

1415
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,520
suppress viral activity

1416
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,840
and completely eliminate, in the early and middle stages,

1417
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,640
the viral toxins inside the infected.

1418
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,720
It can cure

1419
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,040
The greenhouse behind the laboratory

1420
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,680
is the main

1421
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,120
preparation site for the agents.

1422
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:49,920
So,

1423
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,800
the agent ingredients are all stored there.

1424
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,280
Okay, that's how it is.

1425
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,000
The three of them have been infected.

1426
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,520
We'll prepare the medicine for them here.

1427
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,720
Then have them drink it in a bit.

1428
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,480
It will detoxify them.

1429
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,280
So we just need to find

1430
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,200
Agent D for them.

1431
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,360
Yes, we need to find D.

1432
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,400
Like this.

1433
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,680
There are cups here.

1434
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,480
He doesn't.

1435
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,080
Did he write it?

1436
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,360
Research shows reagent A is sour.

1437
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,120
B is spicy. Is it bitter?

1438
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,400
Let's do it this way.

1439
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,320
Let's suppress it for them first.

1440
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,400
Then we'll save them.

1441
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,640
No, we have to drink it.

1442
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,400
Because look below.

1443
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Please enter, among reagents A, B, and C,

1444
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,040
the number for the sourest, spiciest, and most bitter.

1445
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:30,920
Then we...

1446
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,000
D should be in there.

1447
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,480
Come on.

1448
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,040
I want to drink the sour one.

1449
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,080
I want the sour one too.

1450
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,360
I can really handle sour.

1451
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,720
I'll take the bitter one. I can't handle spicy.

1452
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:42,920
Then I'll take the spicy one.

1453
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:45,640
Okay.

1454
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,640
Is yours bitter?

1455
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,880
Mine is really bitter.

1456
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,200
You're so sweet.

1457
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,240
Bring the sour one.

1458
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,120
We need to open the cabinet for this, right?

1459
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,080
Wait a second.

1460
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,840
Let her drink first, don't rush.

1461
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,600
Is it very sour?

1462
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,280
You try.

1463
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,160
Which one is more sour?

1464
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,080
Which of these two is sourer?

1465
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,040
They taste equally sour to me.

1466
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,240
Impossible.

1467
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
Let me try.

1468
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,640
Can you handle sour?

1469
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,680
I can handle sour.

1470
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,280
But this one...

1471
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Here, give me a cup of this one.

1472
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,720
Every expression looks the same.

1473
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,160
Can you two do it or not?

1474
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,560
No, it's just that I'm really good at drinking sour things, so...

1475
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,720
Honestly, I can't really taste it.

1476
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:03,920
You two.

1477
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,440
Let's try the next one, the next one.

1478
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
I'm really good at drinking sour stuff.

1479
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,440
It's this one.

1480
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:24,840
Definitely sour.

1481
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:25,800
This one is confirmed.

1482
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,120
It's definitely the sourest.

1483
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,200
Which number?

1484
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,320
Zero nine.

1485
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,040
I'll try the bitter one.

1486
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,280
Why does this look like plain water?

1487
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,520
You can taste this one.

1488
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:49,840
This one.

1489
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,560
Let me teach you a method, come here.

1490
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:04,840
Look at the color.

1491
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,160
Really?

1492
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:06,920
The darkest one.

1493
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,800
No need to taste, it's this one.

1494
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,560
The bitter one is done.

1495
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,360
Number thirteen.

1496
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,640
Now for the spicy one.

1497
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,040
Come on.

1498
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:24,840
Let's do it.

1499
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,240
Let me first...

1500
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,240
Line them all up and take a look.

1501
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
There's light here.

1502
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,600
Actually, they're the same color.

1503
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,120
Okay, it's fine.

1504
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,400
Then I'll try, come on.

1505
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,080
Pick one first, help me choose one to try.

1506
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,040
The one on the far right.

1507
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:45,680
This one.

1508
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:48,880
It's fine.

1509
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,040
This is water.

1510
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,640
It's spicy.

1511
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,120
I think this is a loophole.

1512
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,120
Once you've tasted the spiciness,

1513
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,000
after that, you actually

1514
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,360
can't really feel much difference anymore.

1515
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:06,760
Wait a second.

1516
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,320
Let me use this bitter one to rinse my mouth.

1517
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:23,760
Is this bitter?

1518
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,560
It's just a really strange thing.

1519
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,000
You don't know what you're drinking.

1520
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,560
You know?

1521
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,400
I have some candy.

1522
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,880
Do you want a piece of candy to help with it?

1523
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
Once you've tasted the spiciness,

1524
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,840
after that, you actually

1525
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,120
can't really feel much difference anymore.

1526
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,520
You don't know what you're drinking.

1527
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,240
You know?

1528
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,760
Give me a straw.

1529
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,360
I'll try it too.

1530
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,960
It's so hard to try the spicy one.

1531
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,920
Because my tongue is already burning.

1532
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,400
Yeah, the tongue feels pain.

1533
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,840
This one is even spicier.

1534
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,800
Which number is this?

1535
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:12,800
Twenty-five.

1536
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,200
Twenty-five.

1537
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,600
Twenty-five, spicy. Got it.

1538
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:33,680
What's this?

1539
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,960
Take it out, take these out first.

1540
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,319
Wait, it's a bit too spicy for me.

1541
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,319
Take a moment.

1542
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,040
Give me the access card, come on.

1543
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,000
What does this mean?

1544
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,600
Why are there children's toys on this?

1545
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,920
Take out that D.

1546
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,240
Then,

1547
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,680
mix Reagent A and Reagent B

1548
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,600
with Reagent C,

1549
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,319
add the universal spray and use it.

1550
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:00,600
Spray it on the infected.

1551
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,399
It can slow down their movements.

1552
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,800
These are all

1553
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,600
for the spray.

1554
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,160
After we mix those reagents,

1555
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,560
we spray it on those people to save them.

1556
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,279
This one, and this one too.

1557
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,600
Research content

1558
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,880
Can completely eliminate early and mid-stage illness

1559
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,960
A few people develop special physical traits

1560
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,800
During the early and mid stages

1561
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,399
Red spots will appear on the body

1562
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,720
After these infected people take D for 30 minutes

1563
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,560
They will fall into a deep sleep for three hours

1564
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,200
Mix reagent D with the universal one

1565
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,600
The infected will be dazed for 30 minutes before recovering

1566
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,439
Bitter melon, lemon, celery

1567
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,279
Houttuynia, starfruit, passion fruit

1568
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,680
Alright, our current task

1569
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,479
is to mix the three reagents

1570
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:40,600
into our

1571
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,319
and put them into these spray devices

1572
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,279
Actually, when we encounter infected people later

1573
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,200
we can spray them directly

1574
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,479
They will stop instantly

1575
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,840
Let's mix the reagents first

1576
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,520
Mix the reagents first

1577
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,080
Okay, add a little

1578
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,720
This one

1579
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,279
Right?

1580
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,280
Let's equip those weapons

1581
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:57,880
Equip all of them

1582
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,880
We'll run into them soon

1583
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,480
When we see them, we'll give it to them

1584
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,120
Give them a good dose

1585
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,560
You look cool using this

1586
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,360
You're dual-wielding

1587
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,280
Yeah, that's how I do it

1588
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,720
This one is cool too

1589
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,760
Yours is really cool

1590
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,600
Like this, right?

1591
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,720
You can protect yourself

1592
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,640
Yes

1593
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,200
Alright, that's good

1594
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:31,960
Yours is nice

1595
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,840
Wolverine, this one is awesome too

1596
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,160
This looks really cool.

1597
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,400
Come on.

1598
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,520
I'm actually a little scared.

1599
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:11,560
It's okay.

1600
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,640
Keep it on at all times.

1601
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,640
You turned it on already.

1602
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,680
It'll be gone if you blow on it for a while.

1603
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,440
No one will save you then.

1604
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,280
What are the ingredients?

1605
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,560
Wait a second.

1606
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,920
Bitter melon, lemon, celery.

1607
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,360
Houttuynia, starfruit, passion fruit.

1608
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,440
Let's look for the items first.

1609
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,840
Bitter melon.

1610
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,400
Can you turn on the light?

1611
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:35,880
It's so dark.

1612
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,040
I can't see anything.

1613
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,120
Carrot—this is a carrot.

1614
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,240
Lemon, right?

1615
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah.

1616
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,600
Here's a lemon.

1617
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,480
What else? Starfruit?

1618
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:51,800
Really?

1619
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,840
There's starfruit.

1620
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,520
We have starfruit now.

1621
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:53,920
What else?

1622
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,800
We have passion fruit.

1623
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,440
Got it.

1624
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,600
This is houttuynia.

1625
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,720
Take a bath.

1626
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,360
Are you crazy? Are you seriously crazy?

1627
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,120
Do that "ah-woo" again.

1628
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,360
If you do "ah-woo" again, I'll stuff it in your mouth.

1629
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,960
Stuff it in your mouth.

1630
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,400
Wait a moment.

1631
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:44,440
Set.

1632
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:46,920
Wait a second.

1633
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,240
Quick.

1634
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,520
Celery.

1635
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,760
Lemon, bitter melon.

1636
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,240
Lemon.

1637
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,520
Good.

1638
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,200
Star fruit?

1639
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,760
Want.

1640
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,520
Celery.

1641
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,160
Are you done?

1642
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,320
Bitter melon, found the bitter melon.

1643
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,280
Found it, done.

1644
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:31,880
Found the bitter melon, done.

1645
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,400
Let's go back and prepare D first.

1646
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,600
Let's save them first and take them back.

1647
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,480
Come with us.

1648
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,200
You two, come back with me.

1649
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,280
Go back.

1650
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,280
Where's Ba?

1651
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,560
Let's go back first.

1652
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,400
I told you to come.

1653
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,960
If you move again.

1654
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,560
I'll take your head.

1655
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,440
Where did Ba Mian Linglong go?

1656
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,520
Where's Ba?

1657
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,360
Save me.

1658
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,800
Bite them.

1659
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,880
Aren't you the King of Zombies?

1660
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,480
Quick, prepare the medicine, prepare it quickly.

1661
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:06,960
Prepare the medicine.

1662
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,560
How do I use this?

1663
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,320
The mixer is here.

1664
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,120
Here.

1665
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,600
Put the ingredients in.

1666
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,360
Passion fruit

1667
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:21,960
Bitter melon

1668
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,800
Celery

1669
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,480
Starfruit

1670
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,240
Lemon

1671
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:24,960
Houttuynia

1672
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,400
Okay

1673
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,840
Stop

1674
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,280
Move again and see what happens

1675
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,920
Sit

1676
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,520
Alright

1677
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:49,680
Sit down

1678
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,000
Make that "ah-woo" sound again

1679
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,440
Don't spray them

1680
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,960
Let them chase each other a bit longer

1681
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,840
Let them out

1682
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,720
Right

1683
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,240
Coming

1684
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,560
Here

1685
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,720
Drink a small cup

1686
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,960
I think this taste...

1687
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,400
Drink

1688
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:11,680
Drink

1689
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:13,920
Open your mouth

1690
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,400
You have to finish it

1691
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,440
Finish drinking

1692
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,640
Are you awake yet?

1693
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,920
What's wrong with you?

1694
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,560
Still going

1695
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,800
What's going on?

1696
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,280
Wait, where is this?

1697
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,680
This is the lab

1698
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,600
We just walked through that door

1699
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,120
Then you didn't come over

1700
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,040
Right, because when we went through that door

1701
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,080
it showed we were infected and wouldn't let us through

1702
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,000
What happened to the three of you?

1703
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,240
The three of us got separated.

1704
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,560
How did that happen?

1705
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,440
The three of us were together.

1706
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:20,480
The three of us were together.

1707
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,200
We left through another infected passage.

1708
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,000
After we left through the infected passage,

1709
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,560
Ba Mian Linglong told us

1710
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,800
she felt like she was about to lose consciousness.

1711
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,600
Then she

1712
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,960
wanted to isolate herself.

1713
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,200
So where did she go?

1714
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,840
We don't know where she went.

1715
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,840
She just left separately from us.

1716
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,800
I said no.

1717
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,640
He said yes.

1718
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,400
There's no such thing, it doesn't exist.

1719
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,120
You were like, "Okay, okay, that one."

1720
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,480
Then he just kicked her away.

1721
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,840
What?

1722
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
I couldn't stop it at all.

1723
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,360
Lock the culprit, just lock.

1724
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,120
What?

1725
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,960
No.

1726
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,760
Before she left,

1727
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
she gave us this letter.

1728
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,880
Alright, let's check what's in the letter first.

1729
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,040
She said only she must read it.

1730
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,520
Only she can read it.

1731
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,560
Are you five years old?

1732
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,600
What's going on?

1733
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,080
Someone opened their eyes in that game just now.

1734
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,160
It was Aba, right?

1735
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:27,800
Yes.

1736
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,240
She was the one knocking on the wall, right?

1737
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:30,600
Yes.

1738
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,800
So she was the killer.

1739
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,120
I knew she was the killer all along.

1740
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,480
Because I was the X she chose for this case.

1741
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,080
But when I saw this letter

1742
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:42,920
I felt

1743
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,240
she should be fine.

1744
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,360
She said, haha, a golden reputation.

1745
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,520
I am Ba Mian Linglong.

1746
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,480
Thank you for playing this little game with me.

1747
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,360
Let me secretly tell you

1748
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,440
how I committed the crime.

1749
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,880
Because I was bitten by a monster,

1750
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,680
I was afraid I might lose my mind too.

1751
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,240
So I wrote down the whole process.

1752
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,600
To make your deduction easier.

1753
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,400
April 22, 2025

1754
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,520
10:00 p.m. sharp

1755
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,160
The case involving billions was finally over.

1756
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,680
I returned to my own lounge.

1757
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,040
I'm a little hungry.

1758
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,240
The crew usually provides late-night snacks.

1759
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,480
So I went out to look around.

1760
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,240
I entered from the former

1761
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,400
main gate of the Tuitian Food Factory.

1762
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,000
I walked to the area between the factory owner's office

1763
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,360
and the secret room.

1764
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,200
I found a large puddle of red paint on the floor.

1765
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,280
I couldn't avoid stepping in the paint.

1766
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,480
Then I walked all the way to the tent area.

1767
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,600
This is where the extras rest.

1768
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,400
Sure enough, there were lots of snacks here.

1769
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,960
I grabbed a serving of spicy turkey noodles.

1770
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,000
Since I was already here,

1771
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,920
I took the noodles

1772
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,640
and planned to check out the second floor of the factory.

1773
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,520
To prepare for entering the boot camp tomorrow,

1774
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,440
I wanted to get ready in advance.

1775
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,520
When I went up to the second floor from the back door of the Tuitian Food Factory,

1776
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,040
in the stairwell,

1777
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,480
I ran into a man with red hair

1778
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,880
and scary special effects makeup on his face.

1779
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,040
I couldn't see his features clearly.

1780
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,240
He was wearing a costume with no right sleeve.

1781
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,720
He looked down from the second floor

1782
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,600
and saw me coming up from the first floor.

1783
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,400
He charged at me like a madman

1784
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,200
and tried to attack me.

1785
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,280
Terrified, I grabbed a steel pipe from the stairwell

1786
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,120
and thrust it at him.

1787
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,440
He kept struggling.

1788
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,560
I was extremely scared.

1789
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,080
I dodged and fought back at the same time.

1790
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,280
I kept poking the rebar at him.

1791
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,760
He finally quieted down.

1792
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,640
He fell backward.

1793
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,880
He collapsed in the stairwell.

1794
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,520
The back of his head landed right on

1795
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,000
another piece of rebar standing

1796
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,800
vertically on the floor in the stairwell.

1797
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,800
He died instantly from a head injury.

1798
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,840
I killed someone.

1799
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,040
Even though it was self-defense,

1800
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,240
I went too far.

1801
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,240
I'm a celebrity.

1802
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,440
If this gets exposed,

1803
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,960
my life will be ruined.

1804
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,480
Luckily, when I was scouting the area earlier,

1805
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,240
I noticed there was no one around.

1806
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,560
And just now, on my way to the tent,

1807
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,600
passing by the Tui Tian Sweets Factory,

1808
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,840
and the boss's secret room,

1809
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,760
I saw a piece of paper

1810
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,920
that wasn't stuck down properly

1811
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,200
and had fallen to the floor.

1812
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,680
It had a drawing of the stairwell's

1813
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,000
load-bearing structure.

1814
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,960
The diagram also marked

1815
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,160
four dots in different colors.

1816
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,000
If these four points are damaged,

1817
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,120
the stairs will collapse.

1818
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,880
At the time, I crumpled up the paper

1819
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,840
into a ball

1820
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,040
and tossed it into a corner.

1821
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,320
No one will probably notice it.

1822
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,720
So I decided to make it look like

1823
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,000
the stairs collapsed naturally due to instability.

1824
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,960
He, who was on the stairs,

1825
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,320
was unfortunately crushed to death.

1826
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,800
The rebar also pierced his abdomen and head.

1827
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,280
It was all just an accident.

1828
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,640
So I placed him in the middle of the staircase.

1829
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,040
I casually picked up

1830
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,960
the sledgehammer left by the construction workers near the back door.

1831
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,960
Aiming at the stairwell,

1832
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,400
at the four colored load-bearing points,

1833
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,640
I struck hard.

1834
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,240
The staircase collapsed instantly.

1835
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,640
The whole building lost power for three seconds,

1836
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,840
then the electricity came back on.

1837
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,960
The crew who were rehearsing

1838
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,440
didn't notice anything unusual.

1839
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,520
I looked at the scene of the incident at that moment.

1840
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,680
It was just as I had expected.

1841
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,240
It looked like he had unfortunately

1842
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:16,960
met with an accident.

1843
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,960
Just now, when I was moving him,

1844
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,000
I noticed in his pocket

1845
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,200
there was a slip of paper sticking out.

1846
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,760
It was for a storage locker in the tent area,

1847
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,360
a QR code pickup slip.

1848
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,000
Inside the locker,

1849
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,880
there might be some information about this person.

1850
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,080
I decided to go take a look.

1851
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,000
After all, I also wanted to know

1852
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,320
why this person tried to attack me

1853
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,160
as soon as he saw me.

1854
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
I crept quietly

1855
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,160
and used the QR code slip

1856
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,160
to open the locker reserved for extras.

1857
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,880
I saw a set of patient clothes,

1858
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,720
a bloodstained promotional flyer for a performance,

1859
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,080
and on the blank part, it said:

1860
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,680
"I was harmed back then, fell off the Tiebu Mountain cliff.

1861
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,000
Now, life is worse than death.

1862
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I treated you as a friend, but you betrayed me.

1863
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,280
I want revenge."

1864
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,160
After reading this, I was terrified.

1865
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,240
So that person just now

1866
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,240
was actually the friend who fell off the mountain years ago.

1867
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,120
No wonder he tried to hurt me as soon as he saw me.

1868
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,120
I tore up the flyer with the writing on it

1869
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,720
along with the barcode used to open the locker,

1870
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,280
and casually threw them into the trash can.

1871
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,120
Then I quickly returned to my own break room.

1872
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,360
I realized that the bracelet I always carried with me

1873
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,600
from when I acted in "Dead Ghost Blows Out the Lamp"

1874
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,560
had gotten smeared with

1875
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,440
paint from the load-bearing point in the stairwell.

1876
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,240
To avoid arousing suspicion,

1877
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,720
I threw the bracelet

1878
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,640
into the trash can in the break room's common area.

1879
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,120
Alright, then it really was her who did it.

1880
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,440
All of this was just an accident.

1881
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,800
So she admitted to the crime.

1882
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,600
She confessed.

1883
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,920
But she did it in self-defense.

1884
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,520
That's right.

1885
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,360
She killed the monster.

1886
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,880
She killed a monster.

1887
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,840
Yes.

1888
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,520
There's a story about Aguai.

1889
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,200
And about who the deceased is.

1890
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,360
Right, are there still things we haven't figured out?

1891
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,320
Should we first get these people...

1892
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,120
...rescued before anything else?

1893
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,640
We need to get these people out.

1894
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,520
We definitely have to save them first.

1895
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:42,920
Yes.

1896
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,040
Is there something here with us?

1897
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,480
What is this machine?

1898
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,600
Yeah, what is this machine?

1899
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,120
It's called the research reagent storage.

1900
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,560
The fan can blow it out.

1901
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,800
That way, everyone can be saved.

1902
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,040
To prevent the possibility that one day

1903
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,320
Aguai's virus might spread and cause a disaster,

1904
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,200
I secretly built around the factory and the neighboring office

1905
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,920
a reagent ventilation system.

1906
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,440
As long as the research reagent is poured into the system,

1907
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,000
it can spread into the surrounding air

1908
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,280
and save everyone in time.

1909
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,400
This is a ventilation system dispersal point.

1910
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,720
So you just need to pour that thing inside,

1911
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,480
press that button,

1912
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,040
and it will blow out.

1913
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,240
Right.

1914
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,120
There's a key.

1915
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,080
We need to find a key.

1916
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,080
You two go look for the key.

1917
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,920
We just spent a lot of effort saving you.

1918
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,240
Go find the key, hurry up!

1919
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,840
On you—

1920
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,240
Hurry up.

1921
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:47,960
I don't have that (key).

1922
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,800
Here.

1923
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,200
What's with this key?

1924
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,680
We got it off a monster.

1925
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,640
It wasn't me.

1926
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,760
You saw it on that monster.

1927
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,240
There was a key.

1928
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,360
You thought it might be useful.

1929
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,960
You kicked Ba away.

1930
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,320
You had her help grab the key.

1931
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,160
Then Ba, to help us,

1932
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,920
fought with that monster for a long time.

1933
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,040
She grabbed the key and threw it to us.

1934
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,560
And then you kicked her away again.

1935
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,040
Okay.

1936
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,920
Alright.

1937
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,120
Okay, close it.

1938
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,360
The ventilation system is on.

1939
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,840
The ventilation system has started.

1940
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,640
Spraying the reagent.

1941
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,560
Let's go take a look.

1942
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,680
They've passed out.

1943
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,200
They've all fallen unconscious.

1944
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,760
We've successfully developed

1945
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,680
Reagent D.

1946
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,840
It saved these infected people.

1947
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,720
Ah-woo.

1948
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,400
That's right.

1949
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,400
They'll wake up soon.

1950
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,640
They should recover their health.

1951
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,000
Let's go.

1952
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,600
Aguai, what's going on?

1953
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,240
Do you know what this is?

1954
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:28,880
This is

1955
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,160
the sleeve from the deceased.

1956
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,040
But that bracelet is strange.

1957
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,000
There's something written on the bracelet.

1958
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,280
2024

1959
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,000
2024 Outstanding Graduate Commemoration

1960
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,560
The bracelet is from our school.

1961
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,600
All outstanding graduates have one.

1962
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,680
There was a photo yesterday.

1963
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,920
It showed the outstanding graduates.

1964
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,360
All six of us were in it.

1965
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,120
So we're all from the same year.

1966
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,400
Then whose bracelet is this?

1967
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,320
This bracelet was taken from the deceased.

1968
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,240
This was also taken from the deceased.

1969
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,000
We are the 2024 outstanding graduates.

1970
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,040
So this category only exists

1971
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,080
among the six of us.

1972
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,400
So this bracelet

1973
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,960
belongs to one of the six of us.

1974
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,240
It's one of ours, right?

1975
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,040
He picked up our bracelet.

1976
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,760
So that means

1977
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,960
this person is our classmate.

1978
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,240
He took it from one of us.

1979
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,000
This bracelet.

1980
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,520
I have an idea.

1981
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:17,920
Okay.

1982
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,760
Let me share a thought.

1983
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,880
This bracelet belongs to one of the six of us.

1984
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,480
Right.

1985
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,400
Is it possible

1986
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,000
that someone else took his identity

1987
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,360
and is among the six of us?

1988
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,440
Because here's the thing.

1989
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,360
It's possible that

1990
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,280
the person who died today, whose face was unrecognizable,

1991
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,520
was actually one of the people

1992
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,000
in our group graduation photo of six.

1993
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,680
One of them.

1994
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,800
For example, this is mine.

1995
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,520
I've mutated.

1996
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,320
Right now, I've mutated.

1997
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,600
This would definitely be on my wrist.

1998
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,080
So I want to ask,

1999
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,080
how did you get this wristband?

2000
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,800
Can you show me how you got it?

2001
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,640
How did I get the wristband?

2002
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,680
This wristband has always

2003
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,560
been on me from the beginning until now.

2004
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,920
You've been locked in here with A-Guai the whole time.

2005
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,000
You've been locked up here since 2020.

2006
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,960
How could you have

2007
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,760
a 2024 Outstanding Graduate wristband?

2008
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,280
And only the six of us

2009
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,200
are from 2024.

2010
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,720
Okay, you just said your friend Jin

2011
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,280
has been here since 2020.

2012
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,160
Started living here.

2013
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:12,880
That story,

2014
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,000
so that means it's not Jin.

2015
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,920
Maybe it's his friend.

2016
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:15,760
Maybe it's his friend.

2017
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,640
Maybe it's my friend.

2018
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,240
He confirmed it was Jin.

2019
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,640
His computer, his notebook,

2020
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,480
on his computer it says

2021
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,760
Jin is the nickname.

2022
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,480
The real account is "Pengyou."

2023
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,040
Then why is this

2024
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,240
in Jin's hands?

2025
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,040
Right.

2026
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,720
That means he has already met

2027
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,640
one of the six of us.

2028
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,720
He took it, he stole it.

2029
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,520
Yes.

2030
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,680
It can't be mine, right?

2031
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,880
Because I care about each of you a lot.

2032
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880
So I've always kept your photos.

2033
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,440
Actually, it's me and Ba.

2034
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,200
We're both the culprits.

2035
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,400
But we just exposed ourselves.

2036
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,280
No, what do you mean?

2037
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,200
So I wasn't supposed to look just now?

2038
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,000
You weren't supposed to read it out loud? Really?

2039
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,520
Is it that serious?

2040
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,080
No way.

2041
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,280
Just kidding, Ba only killed a monster.

2042
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,200
So the real culprit is the one who poisoned the victim.

2043
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,760
Right.

2044
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,040
The infection only happened today.

2045
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,040
Eight hours.

2046
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,360
By a little after 8 p.m., he was already biting himself.

2047
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,920
And that photo was also taken at 8:30.

2048
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,040
That's not right.

2049
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,000
I think you all are stuck in a loop.

2050
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,440
Why do you keep thinking

2051
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,000
that one of you poisoned him

2052
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,080
or infected him with a virus?

2053
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,640
We agreed on this

2054
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,800
a long time ago.

2055
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,640
Why?

2056
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,720
Let me tell you why. First,

2057
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,480
this person died twice.

2058
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,640
Yes, physical death and chemical death.

2059
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,160
Okay.

2060
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,280
What we're looking for is who poisoned him.

2061
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,760
It's written very clearly on this paper.

2062
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,880
What if

2063
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,320
to prevent Ah Guai's virus one day

2064
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,360
from spreading and causing a disaster.

2065
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,720
So Ah Guai carries a virus.

2066
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,080
Then what kind of person is Ah Guai?

2067
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,280
Ah Guai was, from a young age,

2068
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,280
fostered in that room.

2069
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,920
Basically, you could say he was a pathogen.

2070
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,240
Everyone started getting poisoned today.

2071
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:04,760
Right?

2072
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,760
So yesterday, they were all still normal.

2073
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,320
Normal people.

2074
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:07,560
Yes.

2075
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,880
They were all at the same time—

2076
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,800
Did they get poisoned together with Jin?

2077
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:14,760
Does that mean—

2078
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,080
One of the six of us

2079
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,240
released Aguai.

2080
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,680
He caused everyone to get poisoned.

2081
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,120
Only after Aguai was released

2082
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,200
could the virus spread.

2083
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:24,640
Yes.

2084
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,680
Yes, Aguai is the pathogen.

2085
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,720
This must be the key.

2086
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,520
That dead person might be Aguai.

2087
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,680
Because he was wearing a hospital gown.

2088
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,320
That's possible too.

2089
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,240
The deceased Aguai will have red hair appear.

2090
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,040
The deceased Aguai will have red hair appear.

2091
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,200
Those with red patterns appearing on their skin

2092
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:47,880
are showing external symptoms.

2093
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,640
The one who died is Aguai.

2094
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,000
After the virus fully mutates,

2095
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,520
it will become highly contagious.

2096
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,720
So it's because Aguai died

2097
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,240
that everyone in this building started to mutate.

2098
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,840
Now, poisoning is no longer a factor.

2099
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,520
Someone made his hair turn red.

2100
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,640
Now we just need to find out

2101
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,920
who would want to kill Aguai.

2102
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,360
Full facial and vocal cord reconstruction.

2103
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,400
With the emergence of plastic surgery,

2104
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,080
it definitely means there could be identity swapping.

2105
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,680
At this point,

2106
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,400
is it possible

2107
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,120
that the conflict is between Aguai and Jin's friend?

2108
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,160
The two of them killed each other.

2109
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,280
After midnight,

2110
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:12,920
all actions

2111
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,560
were definitely abnormal compared to before.

2112
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,320
No, wait a second.

2113
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,640
We weren't together.

2114
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,640
At 12:15 yesterday afternoon,

2115
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,400
At 12:15 yesterday afternoon,

2116
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,120
he died.

2117
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,240
I was in the bathroom at that time.

2118
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,000
You're lying.

2119
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,040
I didn't see you.

2120
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,040
I didn't see you either.

2121
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:27,560
Wait.

2122
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,400
Wait.

2123
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:28,480
Eighteen years in captivity.

2124
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,400
Eighteen years in captivity.

2125
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,920
It's my first time entering society in eighteen years.

2126
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,160
What name should I give myself?

2127
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,000
Prince Charming.

2128
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,640
That's just a fairy tale in your head.

2129
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,960
What kind of ghost was he before?

2130
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,840
A Skin-Changing Ghost.

2131
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,720
So he's very familiar

2132
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,000
with the skin-changing lifestyle.

2133
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,320
The way he does things

2134
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:41,760
is taking the blame, changing faces, and pretending.

2135
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,160
It's taking the blame, changing faces, and pretending.

2136
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:43,720
Alright, Skin-Changing Ghost.

2137
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,360
I vote for him.

2138
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,440
It's a classic one-out-of-two choice.

2139
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:47,920
No.

2140
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:48,560
No.
