1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,230
The real culprit is

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,310
Jingou Baio.

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,630
After we found out

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,630
who really killed Old Master Gu De,

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,470
we all went our separate ways.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,670
I went back to my room to rest.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,470
I was changing into my ceremonial clothes

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,590
when I suddenly felt dizzy.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,790
After that, some of my memories started coming back in fragments.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,990
It turns out I am not Jingou Baio,

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,510
but Jin She.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,790
That is, Mr. She’s younger sister.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,110
He, Bai, Yue, and Ba

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,790
are all my family too.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,270
My older brother,

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,230
Mr. She has already forgotten his original intentions.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,710
He’s gone further and further down the path of crime.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,830
He kills the innocent for his own goals.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,270
I can’t let him keep making these mistakes.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,510
I remembered all the moments I shared with White Snake.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,630
I took a fruit knife from the flower hall.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,310
I went back to my room and carved a pair of lotus figurines.

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,710
I secretly went to my brother’s hideout.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,870
But he wasn’t there.

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,270
So I left a note.

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,750
I asked him to meet at five thirty

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,910
in the front hall of the Gu De mansion.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,670
As expected, my brother arrived on time for the meeting.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,950
To avoid drawing attention,

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,310
I brought him to the room where I was staying tonight.

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,470
I questioned him about why he made us lose our memories.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,310
Why did he do these terrible things?

33
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,510
He kept insisting that he did nothing wrong.

34
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,910
He said he did it all for our own good.

35
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,950
During the argument,

36
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,230
I accidentally used that

37
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,710
fruit knife used to carve the lotus figurine

38
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,990
and stabbed him in the abdomen.

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,390
With a look of shock on his face, he slowly collapsed.

40
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,670
He lost his life.

41
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,790
Brother, I never expected things to turn out this way.

42
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,150
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,150
By then, it was already 5:35.

44
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,550
It was almost time to set out for the parade with everyone.

45
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,190
I didn't have time to deal with the body.

46
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,630
In my panic, I thought of She Er.

47
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,590
He is my most loyal subordinate.

48
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,230
At that time,

49
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,710
he was the one who helped us

50
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,550
escape from my brother.

51
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,710
I used Tui Taiye's phone

52
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,950
to contact She Er.

53
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,350
She Er said to leave everything to him.

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,830
After the ceremony,

55
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,070
he would return as quickly as possible

56
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,470
to Gude House.

57
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,830
He would use the matching rings to help me

58
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,550
control Mr. She's body.

59
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,430
He would move it out of my room for the night

60
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,350
and then bring it before everyone.

61
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,189
He would make it look like a suicide.

62
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,029
That way, I could join the others

63
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,350
and participate in the parade without worry.

64
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,430
I followed She Er's instructions.

65
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,670
I hid the lotus figurine.

66
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,350
Then I threw the phone into the yard.

67
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,550
I went to the front hall to meet up with everyone.

68
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,750
The parade started on time.

69
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,790
I finished the parade together with everyone.

70
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,950
Then we all returned to Good House together.

71
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,950
We walked through the front hall.

72
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,870
As we headed toward the main hall,

73
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,990
we saw Mr. She

74
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,190
walk from the side to the center of the courtyard.

75
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,030
In front of everyone,

76
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,150
he pulled a knife from his robe and stabbed himself to death.

77
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,310
So, are we the culprits in this case?

78
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,430
First, you need to complete your X challenge today.

79
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,110
Okay.

80
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,630
And our rules are:

81
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,910
There are a total of ten brain teasers.

82
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,110
You need to answer them within two minutes.

83
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,390
If you get six correct, you complete the challenge.

84
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,990
This is the hardest one.

85
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,150
An egg ran to Shanxi.

86
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,470
West chicken, west egg.

87
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,310
Shanxi.

88
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,630
It ran to Shandong.

89
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,230
An egg ran to Shandong.

90
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,270
Shandong is...

91
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,830
Shandong is Lu—marinated egg.

92
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,510
It would say to you,

93
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,910
Broken.

94
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,230
I'm broken. Good night.

95
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm so good.

96
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,790
How do I know everything?

97
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,190
Broken.

98
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,190
Magic hands.

99
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,190
Dog paw, pig trotter.

100
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,470
Cactus.

101
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,870
Cactus.

102
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,750
I know this one. I think I've seen it before.

103
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,510
It should be...

104
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,830
Yes.

105
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,110
Black Cat Detective

106
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,190
The white cat won.

107
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,550
Because the black cat was nervous.

108
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,790
Yes, I've seen this.

109
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,390
I think I've seen this one too.

110
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,470
White halo

111
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,310
White cloud

112
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
Little White

113
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
Little White Rabbit

114
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,829
Little White gets carsick.

115
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,269
Because Little White throws up.

116
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,910
There's only one question left.

117
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,590
Okay.

118
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,670
Ultraman Tiga

119
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,150
My home is in the northeast.

120
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,990
Ultraman Tiga's hometown is the northeast.

121
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,630
Alright, congratulations on completing the challenge.

122
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,270
I've finally waited for this.

123
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,230
Dilraba is next door.

124
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,190
I've finally waited for this day.

125
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,310
Liu Yuning

126
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,790
Let's turn over

127
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,470
the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning".

128
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,070
Let's escape with zero votes together.

129
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,270
Yes.

130
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,430
Liu Yuning

131
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,990
Good morning

132
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,390
Director

133
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,630
If we escape with zero votes

134
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,630
If it's me and Liu Yuning

135
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,510
If we have a great reconciliation

136
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,550
and join forces again

137
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,990
can we get two keys?

138
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,830
Two keys for each person.

139
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,110
Not two keys for both of us together.

140
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,990
Wedding today

141
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,230
The big wedding day

142
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,830
That's right

143
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,830
Is it still you today, bro?

144
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,430
You’re the detective today, remember?

145
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,190
It’s me today

146
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
You’re X today

147
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,470
No more talking

148
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,710
Because you picked me

149
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,590
No

150
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,110
Let me tell you

151
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,430
If you dare pick me today

152
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,230
I’ll definitely report you

153
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,830
I swear

154
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,030
I really can do it

155
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,710
You can play like this

156
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,350
I’m really playing like this today

157
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,150
You can play like this

158
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,750
Playing like this actually confuses them

159
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,430
If you dare pick me

160
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,590
I’ll definitely report you today

161
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,430
Of course I dare pick you

162
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,470
Why wouldn’t I dare pick you?

163
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,470
You’ve already picked, right?

164
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,710
I picked a long time ago

165
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,590
I decided before we set out

166
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,830
You look like a martial arts leader

167
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,630
Your outfit today

168
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,910
What’s up with you two today?

169
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,750
We’re on the same team

170
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,750
You don’t know, we are

171
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,110
Then why is he hurt and you’re not?

172
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,070
You made him go out and fight

173
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,910
You stood in the back and watched

174
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,950
He’s covering for the culprit

175
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,390
He said this.

176
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,270
He covered for the culprit.

177
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,510
That's a bit suspicious.

178
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,110
Hello, everyone.

179
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,910
Brother Daning.

180
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,790
We have to work well together today.

181
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,030
Let's put our past grudges behind us.

182
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,630
We have to have an episode that's

183
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,950
explosive and amazes everyone.

184
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,710
Let's make it today, okay?

185
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,430
You're the culprit.

186
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,830
I'm not the culprit.

187
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,150
I don't believe you.

188
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,990
Right, what if the culprit assigned you to do X?

189
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,510
Yeah.

190
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,390
She's not the culprit.

191
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,550
Now you think I'm not the culprit?

192
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,270
You're not.

193
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,270
Don't try to frame me like this.

194
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,470
You saved me again.

195
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,990
Why is it always you who saves me?

196
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,110
Because I'm always watching out for you.

197
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,550
Let's give Zhang Linghe a stress test.

198
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,710
He's coming today.

199
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,350
He's the culprit.

200
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,030
No.

201
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm the culprit.

202
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,150
Yes.

203
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,910
Who did you give it to, or who got it from you?

204
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,430
I can't say.

205
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,750
Because if I say it, it'll affect everyone.

206
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,750
But I have a very, very clear

207
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,270
I saw it

208
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,350
Tear up what you saw

209
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,670
I'm the killer

210
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,870
Can you handle it?

211
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,670
No matter what, I have to handle it today

212
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,950
Vote for me

213
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,190
Vote for you

214
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,670
Vote for me

215
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,190
Giving up on defending

216
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,030
Please vote for me

217
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,830
Vote for me

218
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,270
Giving up resistance

219
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,070
Am I still sitting here today?

220
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,750
You sit

221
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,270
You don't deserve it. Today the detective sits there

222
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,310
Who's the detective today?

223
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,950
Me

224
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,110
You're the detective

225
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,710
Yesterday, you guys

226
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,150
Who was the detective with you?

227
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,830
Me and Ke

228
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,030
You today

229
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,550
If you were the killer, who would you choose?

230
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,750
If I were the killer, I'd choose you

231
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,630
It's not me

232
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,510
Ke Yu and you, right?

233
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,270
I'd definitely choose Ning

234
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,510
I have to perform together with him

235
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,430
Escaped with zero votes

236
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,110
Just thinking about it excites me.

237
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,070
Hurry.

238
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,630
Let's start quickly.

239
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,710
These two still haven't arrived.

240
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,590
Are they choosing X?

241
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,670
No, because I think

242
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,950
today is a very different day for Ke.

243
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,550
It's a very unusual day.

244
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,230
Because yesterday,

245
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,990
he already hit rock bottom.

246
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,950
Let's give him some time to prepare, okay?

247
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,390
Let's not rush or push him.

248
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,870
Today, he's the detective.

249
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,950
Usually,

250
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,750
for example, if someone

251
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,910
fails,

252
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,350
and you can tell he's really frustrated,

253
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,790
when we record the next day,

254
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,030
I always give him

255
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,110
some space, not to target him too much. Right.

256
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,470
Got it.

257
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,270
Give him some encouragement.

258
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,950
But Ke Yu, I think he's still a kid.

259
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,270
He needs to keep experiencing setbacks.

260
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,430
He's not afraid.

261
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,870
This round, she could very likely be the culprit.

262
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,910
Because of the emotional connection between you two,

263
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,910
if someone new gets involved with him emotionally,

264
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,750
you can't handle it.

265
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,590
Can I go now?

266
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,470
Why are you looking at me like that? You look so silly.

267
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,470
He doesn't really seem like it.

268
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,510
He doesn't really seem like it.

269
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,750
Why not? Tell us more.

270
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,390
He feels different from last time when he was chosen as X.

271
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,190
What if he adjusted his state on purpose?

272
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,110
Then that's impressive. You're impressive.

273
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,190
I've grown. I really have.

274
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,390
He definitely has grown.

275
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,590
But you...

276
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,270
Why do I feel like you've regressed a bit?

277
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,830
What's up with your foot?

278
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,230
The more you say, the more mistakes you make.

279
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,230
I'll stop talking.

280
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,590
As soon as you came in,

281
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,590
I noticed your foot...

282
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,390
No, that's not it.

283
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,670
I saw it too.

284
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,230
Morning, bro.

285
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,990
Bro.

286
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,430
Bro.

287
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,030
We still haven't asked that question.

288
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,390
If the killer had to choose someone as X,

289
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,590
It's fine, no need to ask.

290
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,270
If...

291
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,510
We don't need to ask?

292
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,350
You guys ask.

293
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,790
It has nothing to do with me.

294
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,590
Then I want to know, will you answer me?

295
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,910
Okay, I'll answer. Go ahead.

296
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,870
These two people...

297
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,350
If you could choose one of them to be X,

298
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,030
Who would you choose?

299
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,590
I'd choose you.

300
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,430
Me?

301
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,790
Yeah.

302
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,550
I'm not the detective.

303
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,550
Then I'd choose you too.

304
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,830
No, he chose the person he likes.

305
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,590
Yeah.

306
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,470
Everyone, please turn your attention

307
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,670
to

308
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,990
Even I'm getting a bit nervous

309
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,950
Look at his expression

310
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,990
Brother Da Ning

311
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,270
Okay

312
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,510
It's not me today

313
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,350
Not you

314
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,670
You went to the wrong spot

315
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,790
Let's have fun today

316
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,870
Getting nervous

317
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,630
Getting nervous

318
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,390
You're so nervous

319
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,830
I said, if I were the one today

320
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,350
I would definitely reveal the culprit

321
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,750
and make it public

322
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,790
Let's play openly today

323
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,790
You didn't

324
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,670
This morning you only said if you were the one

325
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,350
You would only expose me

326
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,310
So you're the culprit

327
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,430
You chose him

328
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,870
Right

329
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,390
He already knows

330
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,990
Right

331
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,190
Okay, if I am X

332
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,870
If you contact me later, I will definitely expose you

333
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,270
Okay

334
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,270
I told Jin

335
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,070
If we can't escape with zero votes today

336
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,270
We won't take the golden key

337
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,350
I think the two of us are like "madmen"

338
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,550
He said it's a perfect collaboration

339
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,750
Let these friends know

340
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,950
what a true alliance of the strong is

341
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,950
I said I've waited too long for this day

342
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,870
I wanted to say it's advanced gameplay

343
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,910
but I was too shy to say it

344
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,670
I just said it's a strong alliance

345
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,950
Okay.

346
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,830
I haven't figured out the plan yet, but tonight

347
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,790
the dinner after our recording ends

348
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,030
I've already decided to make it

349
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,430
our celebration party.

350
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,750
Ning,

351
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,870
are you X?

352
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,630
Why are you smiling like that?

353
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,590
I'm not telling you.

354
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,750
He is.

355
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,990
I'm not telling you.

356
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,510
Really?

357
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,630
Yeah, he's my X.

358
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,870
Wait, when everyone comes in

359
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,230
I'm going to tell everyone the truth.

360
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,990
Wait a second.

361
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,870
No, bro, don't.

362
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,590
Give me some face.

363
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,590
Wait, I want to take a photo with him.

364
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,790
Show some respect.

365
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,790
I already said

366
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,550
if you message me

367
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,630
I'll report you.

368
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,830
Don't make me laugh, let's take a photo.

369
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,830
The owner of that clothing store just said

370
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,950
"You finally called me."

371
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,550
Back then, he helped you escape.

372
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,750
In other words, he was the one who helped

373
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,910
all four of you escape at that time.

374
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,230
All four of you know him.

375
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,430
Yes.

376
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,710
That's right.

377
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,910
Yes.

378
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,910
This is a key point.

379
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,750
What, your conversation fell apart?

380
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,710
You accidentally killed him.

381
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,070
Yes.

382
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,510
Yes.

383
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,190
Accidentally?

384
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,950
When this person helped you escape back then,

385
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,030
he was already working for you.

386
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,030
So the next step

387
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,710
is to see where he died.

388
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,550
The room.

389
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,310
Which room is it?

390
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,950
No, otherwise the lineup was for nothing.

391
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,630
Yeah, we lined up.

392
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,310
Because he slept in the junkyard yesterday.

393
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,710
Right.

394
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,150
Really.

395
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,310
You went back to the junkyard to sleep yesterday.

396
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,870
Yeah.

397
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,230
Then you lined up today.

398
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,750
Yes.

399
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,230
It was the three of us.

400
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,910
We helped each other get dressed, right?

401
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,030
You, me, and him.

402
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,150
I can't line up.

403
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,670
I went back to my young master's room.

404
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,550
Can you say something honest?

405
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,310
You...

406
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,750
He said it.

407
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,070
He was the one who said it.

408
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,430
Why did you line him up?

409
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,790
X

410
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,230
Just kidding.

411
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,950
I'm just joking, that's all.

412
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,710
Like this.

413
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,470
Let's first go over the victim's

414
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,230
route.

415
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,630
Okay.

416
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,110
Got it.

417
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,830
We can just work backwards from the end point.

418
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,550
Because we already know one person's route.

419
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,310
Isn't the victim's end point over there?

420
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,110
So let's start from the end point.

421
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,310
If he turns right,

422
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,710
this person turns around.

423
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,190
At the same time, he also turns around.

424
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,790
Yes, both people move in sync.

425
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,190
Right.

426
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,830
So it looks like you're not X.

427
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,150
I'm definitely not.

428
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,430
Then turn here.

429
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,550
Which way?

430
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,470
Right.

431
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,510
Let's turn left.

432
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,670
Either left or right is fine.

433
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,070
Because those are two rooms.

434
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,030
Either way is fine.

435
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,230
Come on.

436
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,230
Let's try this one first.

437
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,430
Let's go with this room.

438
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,910
Yes.

439
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,030
Jin's room.

440
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,790
Okay, He’s room is this way.

441
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,230
That works too.

442
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,870
Maybe our length

443
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,830
just let us come in directly.

444
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,270
Both of us lined up on the left and right sides.

445
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,510
No, this can only line up one person.

446
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,470
So the one left out is Ba, actually.

447
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,710
Right.

448
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,150
That's not it.

449
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,150
This is just leaving Ba out.

450
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,390
Bro, stop overthinking it.

451
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,790
I just want to try to rule myself out, is that not okay?

452
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,950
Can't I at least try?

453
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,950
Besides, I'm way too suspicious.

454
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,270
There's a door here.

455
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,670
But what he said makes sense too.

456
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,830
For example, running over to put a ring on him.

457
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,510
This kind of thing definitely needs to be planned in advance.

458
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,110
The point about regaining memories is worth analyzing.

459
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,950
Among the four of us,

460
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,070
whoever regains their memory

461
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,270
would immediately go to find the eldest brother.

462
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,950
I think among the three of us,

463
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,990
whoever regains their memory

464
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,470
could all possibly go to the eldest brother right away.

465
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,550
No, the reason I said this

466
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,350
was to clear myself of suspicion.

467
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,349
Go on.

468
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,150
Because if I regained my memory,

469
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,750
the first ones I would look for

470
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,470
would definitely be the two butterflies.

471
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,270
You find the two butterflies,

472
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,349
and realize that your real wife is this one.

473
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,550
So you’re anxious to find the eldest brother.

474
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,069
To switch our bodies back.

475
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,390
That’s why you arranged to meet him at 5:30.

476
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,390
It makes perfect sense.

477
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,870
Your level of urgency

478
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,790
is the same for all four of us.

479
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,790
We’ve already discussed this before.

480
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,670
If you regain your memory,

481
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,430
you’ll go find your lover.

482
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,030
If I regain my memory,

483
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,310
I’ll also immediately go find my lover.

484
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,950
If he regains his memory, he’ll come find me too.

485
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,590
Is there any way to rule out someone just because they went to find their lover?

486
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,950
As for the timing of regaining memories,

487
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,070
the reason we can’t be sure

488
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,590
is because the gap in time is too long.

489
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,230
I think the person most eager

490
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,790
to find this She eldest brother

491
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,790
is He.

492
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,270
You can take a look at the chat history.

493
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,670
He really was quite anxious.

494
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,390
Because every time someone asked,

495
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,630
"When will Xiao Ba be back?"

496
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,870
he was always the first to speak.

497
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,670
He seemed very anxious.

498
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,830
Because when he asked that brother,

499
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,510
he said, "When will Xiao Ba be back?"

500
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,390
And then it got pretty awkward.

501
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,910
And all these things were said by him.

502
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,630
Including when he found out about that She-ge,

503
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,590
it seemed like he had killed someone.

504
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
He was involved in a bombing case.

505
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,550
He was also the first to speak about these things.

506
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,950
Allow me to object.

507
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,310
When I spoke in the group chat,

508
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,470
I kept asking what Ba represented.

509
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,550
It meant I was eager to find my wife.

510
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,350
So, as I just said,

511
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,390
I would definitely go look for

512
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,510
my two butterflies right away.

513
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,550
Doesn't that mean you've already regained your memory?

514
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,310
That's how you know Xiao Ba is your wife.

515
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,270
And not Jin, right?

516
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,470
Right, if I regained my memory,

517
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,870
that's the premise.

518
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,030
And the second point,

519
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,710
I am very,

520
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,110
very strongly condemning my brother

521
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,950
for this kind of behavior.

522
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,750
What does that represent?

523
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,230
It represents

524
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,670
that I am a person full of justice.

525
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,110
I'm such a righteous person,

526
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,030
how could I possibly commit murder?

527
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,870
Let me share my two suspects for the real culprit.

528
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,910
It's these two people.

529
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,830
First, let me explain why it could be him.

530
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,070
Because, like He Du,

531
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,350
he was anxious that his wife was in the wrong body.

532
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,070
So he wanted to get his wife back

533
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,710
as soon as possible.

534
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,590
But he wasn't as anxious as the other one.

535
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,270
Right, and in terms of wanting to switch wives,

536
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,110
they were the same.

537
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,070
There's another thing.

538
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,070
What kind of person could argue with the boss

539
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,990
and get into a fight here?

540
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,790
It must be someone who previously

541
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,830
opposed the boss in the group chat.

542
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,550
Boss, I've completely regained my memory now.

543
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,710
And you still created confusion for us.

544
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,990
Stop being so stubborn.

545
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,510
The boss said, "I'm doing this for your own good."

546
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,470
What does the boss mean by "good"?

547
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,350
Is killing someone considered good?

548
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,110
Boss.

549
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,590
It was an accident.

550
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,550
Who started this whole thing?

551
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,590
Because of her.

552
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,950
First of all, the first one is

553
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,470
He Wen asked.

554
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,150
Bro, do you still have a way to help with Xiao Ba's issue?

555
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,590
He asked for her first.

556
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,870
Secondly, the second one is

557
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,070
Bai Sect asked for you.

558
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,790
He said, "Bro,"

559
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,910
do you still have a way to help with Xiao Jin's issue?

560
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,030
Right now, there's no way to switch bodies.

561
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,790
Sorry.

562
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,790
But at this point,

563
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,790
there's something I think

564
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,750
really highlights your personality.

565
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,790
Here, Jin said something.

566
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,790
Jin said, "Bro, you're too careless."

567
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,510
How could you mix up my body with Ba's?

568
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,590
I understand too.

569
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,990
You're anxious, right?

570
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,590
It's a bit awkward.

571
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,670
But after all, he's the big brother.

572
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,750
It's this culprit.

573
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,390
It must be someone in the She family

574
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,870
who has a strong opinion.

575
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,870
I think if you judge just based on this,

576
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,750
then it's you.

577
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,950
I don't agree with that.

578
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,350
If you say, based on this,

579
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,150
I think his suspicion is lighter.

580
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,150
These two are suspicious.

581
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,230
I agree with that.

582
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,150
If that's the case,

583
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,710
I really can rule out those two, why?

584
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,070
At the start,

585
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,990
Bro, is there a way to help with Xiao Ba's issue?

586
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,350
Bro, is there a way to help with Xiao Jin's issue?

587
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,390
You can tell right away those two have no opinions of their own.

588
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,590
If I can't make up my mind, I'll ask you.

589
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,750
No, you two are really hard to find.

590
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,630
When he gets mentioned, you immediately step up.

591
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,950
When she gets mentioned, you both step up right away.

592
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,630
No, there's a possibility that X is playing in reverse.

593
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,870
Playing in reverse.

594
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,950
Just because my body got switched by mistake.

595
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,590
I told the boss in the group chat.

596
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,710
Help me, boss.

597
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,230
You didn't switch everyone else.

598
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,390
You switched me by mistake.

599
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,470
Come save me quickly.

600
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,670
I'm just someone with a strong personality.

601
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,550
Someone who would have subordinates.

602
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,230
I just...

603
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,470
I can only judge based on this information.

604
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,470
And then, the second one.

605
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,390
Weren't we just looking for three people?

606
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,790
Who regained their memory?

607
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,470
Isn't the key now to find out

608
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,030
who regained their memory?

609
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,790
Or is it about who has subordinates?

610
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,710
Wait a second.

611
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,110
Hold on.

612
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,030
There was a recording in my room just now.

613
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,510
It said,

614
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,910
If you remember me,

615
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,030
you must sing "Two Butterflies."

616
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,790
Right.

617
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,870
Then the guy sang "Two Butterflies."

618
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,230
Doesn't that mean he regained his memory?

619
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,270
Alright, it's locked in.

620
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,790
No, it's because I saw that yesterday.

621
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,750
Heard that recording.

622
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,030
No, you heard it.

623
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,470
But you suddenly sang it in the middle of the night.

624
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,430
It really is a bit far-fetched.

625
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,630
Now I'm sure it's He.

626
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,310
Because he has a conflict with the boss

627
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,550
There's an established conflict

628
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,390
I believe he has a conflict with the boss

629
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,950
Just like you believe I have subordinates

630
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,510
Okay

631
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,790
Alright

632
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,230
I think the suspicion on him is quite strong

633
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,270
Between the two of them

634
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,110
I think it's him

635
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,790
And just now, when I said that

636
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,110
He said, "Then I think it's not He"

637
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,710
At that moment, I think he handled himself well

638
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,270
Because this person

639
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,550
I can only read his demeanor

640
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:10,990
Okay

641
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,630
So now I firmly believe

642
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,310
He's not the problem

643
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,950
I think it's him

644
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,950
Now it's up to Ning to decide

645
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,110
Then you should share your opinion

646
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,510
I can't say anything

647
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,110
Why?

648
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,710
Because I really don't know

649
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,550
If you don't speak up, you're X

650
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,390
You have to say something

651
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,990
If you refuse to speak now

652
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,350
We'll have to consider you as X

653
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,790
Yes

654
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,070
No, I think

655
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,750
If that's the case

656
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,230
If I speak, I think it's unfair to you

657
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,470
You think it's me

658
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,510
Then I can only choose you

659
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,390
You think it's me

660
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,270
I don't think it's you

661
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,150
Brilliant

662
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,230
Both detectives think it's me

663
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,310
Brilliant

664
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,910
At such a critical moment

665
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,990
Can't I clear my name even now?

666
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,350
The suspect for this case is

667
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,350
Jingou Baio

668
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,550
My vote goes to

669
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,590
Gudefu He

670
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,790
I voted for the real culprit as

671
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,310
Jingou Baio

672
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,030
The culprit I chose is

673
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,950
Jingou Baio

674
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,910
Today's suspect

675
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,310
Jingou Baio

676
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,070
The person I voted for as the culprit is

677
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,870
Gudefu He

678
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,590
The real culprit is

679
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,790
Jingou Baio

680
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,270
So the MVP of this episode

681
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,430
I definitely have to vote for Jin Jing

682
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,110
Yes, because today is also the first time

683
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,710
I teamed up with her

684
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,390
X and the culprit were partners

685
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,790
I feel that throughout the whole process

686
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,390
our cooperation was very in sync

687
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,870
and we did everything we needed to do

688
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,550
And then

689
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,590
some things are just fate

690
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,030
there's nothing we can do about it

691
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,550
but she played really well today

692
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,910
her ability to handle pressure is also very strong

693
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,630
including several rounds of defense

694
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,110
she did everything thoroughly

695
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,310
and I hope we get another chance next time

696
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,670
we must

697
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,750
win a round back

698
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,670
Aren't you giving yourself the MVP this time?

699
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm not the MVP at all.

700
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,110
I am

701
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,070
the worst, what is that?

702
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,950
The least valuable.

703
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,950
I am

704
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,750
the least valuable person.

705
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,150
I'm the most worthless one.

706
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,270
I even dragged Ning down with me.

707
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,230
If I'd known, I wouldn't have picked him as X.

708
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,630
Can I give him the key?

709
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,310
Of course not.

710
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,270
I'll give it to Ning.

711
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,190
He's not just the MVP of this episode.

712
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,510
He'll always be the MVP in my heart.

713
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,390
Liu Yuning

714
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,550
I'll check in at your fan forum every day.

715
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,950
Today's MVP

716
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,230
goes to

717
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,110
A Jin

718
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,350
To protect herself,

719
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,030
she actually voted me out first.

720
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,710
So you think she's really suspicious?

721
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,790
Not suspicious.

722
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,430
Really funny.

723
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,910
Actually, I want to give it to Ning.

724
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,910
Ninety-nine.

725
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,070
A perfect score is a hundred, and my sincerity is already maxed out.

726
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,550
As for this time's MVP,

727
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,470
I'll still vote for Jin Jing.

728
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,310
I think from start to finish,

729
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,190
she acted really well.

730
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,390
You really couldn't tell at all

731
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:11,870
that she was the culprit.

732
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,750
And even at the end,

733
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,630
she was still trying hard to defend herself,

734
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,110
giving evidence that she wasn't the real culprit.

735
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,750
So I think Jin

736
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,870
is the MVP this time.

737
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,670
The MVP of this episode.

738
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,790
I think Jin Jing

739
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,830
Yes, still Jin Jing

740
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,670
Compared to when she was the culprit before

741
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,670
her performance was completely different

742
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,150
When she was the culprit before, she was more

743
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,310
you could see a hint of nervousness

744
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,950
but this time, she was more

745
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,230
Anyway, she managed to fool me

746
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,950
So my MVP this time

747
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,710
is Jin Jing
