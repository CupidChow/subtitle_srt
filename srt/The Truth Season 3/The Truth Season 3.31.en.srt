1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,080
The instigator is

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,240
Better to have none than to settle for less

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,960
The one who took action is

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,840
From the Ke class

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,680
Winning this round feels so good, little brother

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,320
Feels great

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,240
I am the culprit in this case

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,320
From the Ke class

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,480
To make sure that I

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,800
could win the favor of the Billion Director in one go

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,200
I decided to find out about the audition content in advance

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,000
So I used a secondary WeChat account

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,240
and sent a message in the gossip sharing group

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Someone who often trades with me

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
"Working at Billion" messaged me privately

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,760
I found out

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,720
that the Billion audition's character cards would be revealed today

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,280
and they were placed in his office

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,320
If I wanted to sneak a look

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
no one would be there before ten o'clock

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
It's very safe

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,520
I was at Director Dan's desk

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,240
After taking the office access card

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
I slipped into Tui Baiyi's office

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,600
I opened the file folder on the desk

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,640
the one labeled with my name

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Inside, it clearly said

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
"Death Reaper" in three big characters

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
Just as I was feeling confused

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,360
the office phone suddenly rang

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,280
The message shocked me

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,560
Could it be that Tui Baiyi knows my secret?

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
I started searching again

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,760
In the trash can

35
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,240
I found some scraps stained with ink from the trash

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Some dirty, torn pieces of paper

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,320
I didn't expect

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,480
Tui Baiyi actually wrote my dark secret

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,840
on my character card

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,120
trying to use it to control me

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,640
and force me to sign his unfair contract

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,080
For the sake of my career

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,240
and my future

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
I must kill him before the audition to silence him

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Revealing the character and audition

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,120
This process

47
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,360
is written on everyone's schedule

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,560
If I destroy it rashly, everyone will find out

49
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,440
the killer's intention to act

50
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,400
So

51
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,680
I removed everyone's name tags

52
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,200
and hid them in the potted plant

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,680
Anyway, Tui Baiyi won't have the chance

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
to hand out the character cards in public

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,240
Even if everyone finds out later

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,880
they still won't know

57
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,360
that "Death Reaper" is my character

58
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,960
I found a

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
place that's perfect for murder.

60
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,640
It's the abandoned warehouse in the red carpet area.

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,000
After studying the layout and items here,

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,720
I decided to set up a delayed murder device.

63
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
So that Tui Baiyi would

64
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
die between 11:25,

65
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
when we're all together, and 12:00.

66
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,199
At that time,

67
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,680
I would have a perfect alibi.

68
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
Before setting up the device,

69
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,400
I first found a handkerchief in the warehouse.

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,080
I froze the four corners' tassels in an ice cube tray.

71
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,040
Then I ordered

72
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,120
"Zundujiadu" poison

73
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,440
and "Bukekaijiao" adhesive online.

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
Then I used a spare SIM card

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
to call Tui Baiyi.

76
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
I disguised my voice a bit

77
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,080
and claimed to have explosive information

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
to lure him to meet at 11:20

79
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,000
in the abandoned warehouse.

80
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,840
After the red carpet event, everyone split up.

81
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,280
I went back to the public lounge to touch up my makeup.

82
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,760
Then I went to the warehouse to wait for him.

83
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,720
Earlier in the office,

84
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,240
I saw Tui Baiyi's medical records.

85
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,120
He has photosensitive epilepsy.

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
Frequent strong flashes

87
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,520
would make him lose consciousness for five minutes.

88
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
I could use those five minutes

89
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
to set up the delayed device.

90
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
Tui Baiyi arrived at the warehouse on time.

91
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,440
The moment he opened the door,

92
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
I turned on the high-powered flashlight.

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,440
Just as I expected,

94
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,720
Tui Baiyi lost consciousness.

95
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,240
First, I took from the refrigerator

96
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,440
a handkerchief with tassels on all four corners

97
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,400
that had been frozen with ice cubes.

98
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,600
After pouring the poison onto the handkerchief,

99
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
I stepped onto a box

100
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
and removed the grid cover

101
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,680
from the ventilation duct above.

102
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,560
I wedged the handkerchief into the grid.

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
After restoring the ventilation duct,

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
I used the warehouse carpet

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
to wrap Tui Baiyi tightly.

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
Then I used "No Open Glue" to seal the red carpet.

107
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
And on the glued areas,

108
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
I placed a few ice cubes.

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
Then I smashed a porcelain vase.

110
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,080
I used a shard to cut a wound on his face.

111
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
From what I know,

112
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,400
when the ice melts to

113
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
I can make the handkerchief fall from the ventilation duct.

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,040
It will take about fifteen minutes.

115
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,880
By then,

116
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
the handkerchief will drop from directly above

117
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,280
onto Tui Baiyi's face.

118
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,040
The poison on the handkerchief is instantly lethal upon contact with blood.

119
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,480
With a wound on his face, he will die instantly from the poison.

120
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
As for the "non-removable adhesive,"

121
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,560
it will lose its stickiness twenty-five minutes after coming into contact with water.

122
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,920
It will lose its adhesion.

123
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,320
The body will then roll down the slope.

124
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
The carpet will unroll along with it.

125
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,280
The magnetic clasps on the floor

126
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,720
will make everything return to its original state.

127
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,680
Finally,

128
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
I hide the mold label

129
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,320
and the "non-removable adhesive,"

130
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,400
and leave the abandoned storeroom key inside the storeroom.

131
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,640
As long as I unlock the deadbolt from inside the room,

132
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,080
and close the door when I leave,

133
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
the room will be locked from the inside.

134
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,760
During this time, no one

135
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,400
will enter the storeroom and discover any of this.

136
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,600
I leave the storeroom,

137
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,680
break the SIM card,

138
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,840
and throw the broken SIM card and the purchase receipt in a public area.

139
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,920
According to the schedule,

140
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
I arrive at the red carpet area

141
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,399
and continue with the rest of the itinerary with everyone else.

142
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,920
Someone was in the gossip group

143
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,440
asking about rumors related to Tui Baiyi.

144
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,480
I wanted to know who was asking for information.

145
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
What exactly was he trying to find out?

146
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,880
So at 9:35, I used my alternate account

147
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,240
called "Early Retirement"

148
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
to contact the person who leaked the information.

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
He told me during a voice call

150
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,720
that it was someone from the Ke class earlier

151
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,680
who was asking him about the character cards for auditions.

152
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,280
He said the character cards were placed

153
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,840
in Tui Baiyi's office,

154
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
on Deputy Director Dan's desk.

155
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
There was an access card to get in.

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,240
The Ke class person would go in twenty minutes later

157
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,200
to sneak into the office and take a look.

158
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,160
That guy actually dared to try and steal the questions.

159
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,880
So I had to get there before him

160
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,200
and steal them first.

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
After I hung up the call,

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,920
I immediately went to Deputy Director Dan's desk to get the access card.

163
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,960
I slipped into Tui Baiyi's office.

164
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,560
Unexpectedly, while looking through the character cards,

165
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,040
I accidentally saw an investigation record.

166
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
It was clear he was investigating

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,640
dirt on the six of us.

168
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
And

169
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,360
he even found out that I caused my friend's death.

170
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
He wants to use this secret to control me.

171
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
No way.

172
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,480
I can't let him manipulate me.

173
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,840
And I definitely can't let my secret be exposed.

174
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
I have to kill him to silence him.

175
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
I tore up the investigation records.

176
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,080
And splashed ink on them to destroy the information.

177
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,160
But I can't do the killing myself.

178
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,480
It's too risky.

179
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,280
I need to find a way to get someone else to do it.

180
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
And for me,

181
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
the best "weapon" at hand

182
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
is Keban Chushen.

183
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Because I know his secret.

184
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,360
Back then,

185
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
he personally caused someone's death.

186
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
That year, Jin's scumbag boyfriend

187
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
came with people to seek revenge.

188
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,120
I didn't go to the movies directly.

189
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,480
Instead, I hid and watched from the side.

190
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
I saw with my own eyes

191
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,520
that he caused Ning's friend

192
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,040
and his own friend to fall off Tiebu Mountain.

193
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,960
If I make him believe

194
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,680
that Tui Baiyi knows about this,

195
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
and wants to use it against him,

196
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,800
then he might, to protect himself,

197
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
kill to silence someone.

198
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,520
If he doesn't do it,

199
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
I'll think of another way.

200
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
I've decided

201
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,520
to use the chance when he comes to the office later

202
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,960
to create a motive for him to kill Tui Baiyi.

203
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
I used the printer in Tui Baiyi's office

204
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,360
to print out a new copy

205
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
of the "Killer Ghost" character card.

206
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
I replaced the one under Keban Chushen's name

207
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,440
with the "Infatuated Ghost" character card.

208
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,640
I took something from the Tui Baiyi office

209
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,480
—an AI voice synthesizer I found there.

210
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,200
I put the office keycard back where it was.

211
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Then I hid and waited.

212
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,480
When I saw Keban Chushen enter the office,

213
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,920
I used the AI voice synthesizer

214
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,240
to input a message.

215
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,680
It said that Tui Baiyi had a shocking secret.

216
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,640
He wanted to control him for life.

217
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,200
Then I called the office landline

218
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,440
and played the audio for him.

219
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,560
I let him hear the recording.

220
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
After he listened to it,

221
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,320
and saw the exploitative contract,

222
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,560
as well as his own character card,

223
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
which was "Duo Ming Gui" (the Killer),

224
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,400
he would think

225
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,920
that his secret of having killed someone

226
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
had been discovered by Tui Baiyi.

227
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
After doing all this,

228
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
I threw the "Chi Xin Gui" (the Obsessed) character card

229
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,760
and the AI voice synthesizer

230
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,720
into the common area.

231
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,680
Next,

232
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
I just waited quietly to see if Keban Chushen

233
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
would take action.

234
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
After that, I attended the red carpet event.

235
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,680
When the red carpet was over,

236
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,400
I followed my usual work schedule

237
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,640
and went to look for a location for Ba Mian Linglong

238
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
to shoot a short video.

239
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
I saw Keban appear.

240
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
In the public area.

241
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
He sneakily dropped something.

242
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,520
After he left,

243
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,200
I quickly went over to check.

244
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
What he dropped was a

245
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
receipt for buying "Zundujiadu".

246
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
I called the number on it.

247
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
I confirmed that this poison kills instantly on contact with blood.

248
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
It causes instant death.

249
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,520
So Keban will definitely kill Tui Baiyi.

250
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,040
My plan to kill by using someone else’s hand succeeded.

251
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,800
I went to the red carpet area as scheduled.

252
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,920
And continued the next steps with everyone.

253
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Now let's start X's challenge.

254
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
Come on, let's get ready to start.

255
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,440
No.

256
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
How is this possible?

257
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,720
I think even hitting five is tough.

258
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
Just throwing it onto this board,

259
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,159
none of them go in.

260
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
Okay.

261
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Genius.

262
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,040
Whatever.

263
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
It's already over.

264
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,840
Alright, challenge failed.

265
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,360
Thank you.

266
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,880
This feels just like

267
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,000
that scam game on the street.

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
This is impossible.

269
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,560
This.

270
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,080
Alright.

271
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,680
That's enough.

272
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,240
Okay.

273
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
What a pity.

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,960
Such a shame.

275
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm the killer this episode.

276
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,520
So I want to use

277
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,760
the double points card I got in the pilot episode.

278
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,680
The double points card.

279
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,600
It can be used to double the value of my own golden key for a specific round.

280
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,120
I hope I can win today.

281
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,920
And redeem myself from my previous loss.

282
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,360
Who? Jin.

283
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,040
Me.

284
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,000
I had diarrhea.

285
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,640
You were in there for twenty-five minutes.

286
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
You spent the whole time in the bathroom.

287
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah, in the bathroom.

288
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,920
Maybe you just went to the bathroom.

289
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
Maybe you heard it right outside the bathroom door.

290
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,800
Maybe that bathroom

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
is actually connected.

292
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,240
If that's the case, that's really not well designed.

293
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
True.

294
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Don't talk about my artist like that.

295
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
She has a point.

296
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,760
You just happened to have diarrhea in the bathroom.

297
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,800
Don't say anything.

298
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,000
Through that flushing pipe,

299
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,040
listening while using the toilet.

300
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400
What sound?

301
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
It's my first time meeting him.

302
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,280
I already...

303
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm the actress he personally chose.

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
Then you're the most likely to have entered his office.

305
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,240
But I was invited here by him.

306
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
That means he really trusts you.

307
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,640
You must go into his office quite often, right?

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
No.

309
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
I hadn't met him before.

310
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,120
Never met him.

311
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
He picked you as the lead actress for your first collaboration?

312
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,200
Yes.

313
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
It can't be your first time meeting him.

314
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
I think

315
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
it's my first time meeting him.

316
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,000
What about you?

317
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,560
It's my first time too.

318
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
You've met him before, right?

319
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
I've filmed before.

320
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,680
But I haven't worked with him.

321
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
She has worked with him.

322
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
But I was her assistant.

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Then you two are very suspicious.

324
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
Maybe the assistant wanted to ask the billionaire director...

325
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
All the big names are here.

326
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,440
Does our artist still have a chance?

327
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,120
You want to go at nine thirty

328
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,160
to help her out a bit?

329
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,040
Knock knock, the door opens—

330
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,840
What? There's leverage?

331
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
Killed for love.

332
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,280
You, being smart, notice

333
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
that glint in her eye.

334
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,840
You planned everything in just five minutes.

335
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

336
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,440
You seem a little uneasy, I feel like

337
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,920
I really think you're both nervous and uneasy.

338
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
Okay.

339
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,280
Wait a second.

340
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,640
Isn't he a bit uneasy?

341
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,240
Wait.

342
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
No, you know, from my angle

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,560
I can see this side of his face.

344
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,360
The veins on this side are bulging.

345
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Don't say any more.

346
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,920
Because we're about to choose X.

347
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes.

348
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Yes, that's right.

349
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,040
I want to ask something.

350
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
Then let's all talk about it.

351
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
If we were the culprit,

352
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,040
who would we pick as X?

353
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,840
I would definitely pick Bai Yu.

354
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,880
You pick Bai, and you?

355
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
Come on, who would you pick?

356
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,120
I wouldn't pick anyone.

357
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
You wouldn't pick?

358
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,560
Because you're not the culprit.

359
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,120
Even if I were, I still wouldn't pick.

360
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
Can the culprit choose not to pick?

361
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
You can choose not to.

362
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
But that's never happened before.

363
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,920
Last time you were the culprit, you didn't pick.

364
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,120
And today seems like your first time playing.

365
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,160
So the culprit can actually choose not to pick.

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,240
You're really strange.

367
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,360
Why are you picking on me so much today?

368
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,080
No, I don't know.

369
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,680
I'm observing you right now.

370
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm looking for everyone's flaws.

371
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,440
If it were me,

372
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,160
you wouldn't pick either.

373
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
I would pick you.

374
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,160
What about you? Who would you pick?

375
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,440
If I were the culprit today, I would pick him.

376
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,640
Because normally people would think I'd pick Bai Yu.

377
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
So I would definitely pick him.

378
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,800
It's time to test our acting skills again.

379
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
The famous one is back.

380
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,160
Just don't show any expression, okay?

381
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Why are you smiling so brightly?

382
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,280
He thought, "As expected, they chose me."

383
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,400
Is it you?

384
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,280
Drinking water, that's odd.

385
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,600
Why did your hand tremble just now?

386
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm really good at catching details today.

387
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,760
Are you X?

388
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,720
What are you doing? It's itchy here.

389
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Why is it like this?

390
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
So many actions.

391
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,680
Huh? What's going on?

392
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,960
Aren't you supposed to be the righteous type?

393
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,640
Is it about factions?

394
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
Let's observe him.

395
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,320
Is it my turn?

396
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,240
Let me take a look.

397
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,160
He's a bit hard to observe.

398
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,760
He should be smiling too.

399
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
See, he's smiling too.

400
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
Wait, why does he look a bit shy?

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
Your smile today...

402
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,600
...seems a bit forced.

403
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,480
Are you X?

404
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,520
Why do you care if I am?

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Why do I feel like...

406
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
...his smile looks a bit unnatural?

407
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
Drinking water.

408
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,760
Is there something magical about our cups today?

409
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,840
Is there actually water inside? I want to ask.

410
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
Every time I pass by here, I don't want to move anymore.

411
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,360
Then just sit here and don't move.

412
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,840
This feels so good.

413
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
You don't seem very suspicious today.

414
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,480
Don't let me down.

415
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,160
Now, with what you're doing...

416
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
Could you be someone's X?

417
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
Are you forming cliques here?

418
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
X is him.

419
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,240
Think back for a moment.

420
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,920
Remember the look on each of our faces when we came in.

421
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,640
Then you'll understand.

422
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,480
It's such a simple thing.

423
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,520
You might not have noticed.

424
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,440
But we definitely

425
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,600
saw the expressions on both of your faces.

426
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,960
That's right.

427
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,040
Do you know the difference between your two expressions

428
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,800
Is there any difference

429
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
What's the difference

430
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
There's no difference

431
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,440
No difference

432
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,160
Right

433
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm very natural

434
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,920
When you two came in

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,760
The smiling facial expression

436
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,720
was exactly the same

437
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
Except for the fact that you look different

438
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,560
Okay

439
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,080
And when you came in

440
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,040
you both sat down and took a sip of water at the same time

441
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,480
Yes

442
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,600
All your actions were identical

443
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Yes, I was imitating him

444
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,080
I couldn't let you notice

445
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
No, I can't go along with you

446
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
You

447
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
are a bit unreliable

448
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,880
And then this

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,960
"Duoming Gui" was entered separately

450
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Someone used the entry "Duoming Gui"

451
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,600
and replaced it with "Chixin Gui"

452
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,280
Yes

453
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,600
And it happened in the office area

454
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
He has been to the office

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
Wait, this person is the killer

456
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,600
Right

457
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,960
We can admit that now

458
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,000
The one who made the switch is the killer

459
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,680
I think the one who switched it

460
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,640
Why do you think

461
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,760
the one who switched it is the killer

462
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
Are you saying that in this whole incident

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
there might be another accomplice

464
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
I think that logic is possible

465
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,520
Why not

466
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Actually, that makes sense

467
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Each "ghost" has its own story.

468
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,720
"The Coward"

469
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
Today I heard

470
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,400
a story about "The Coward".

471
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,760
In times of danger, he chose to run away.

472
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,880
I think it fits me.

473
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,359
As I listened, I felt it really matched me.

474
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,960
There's also another one, "The Betrayer".

475
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,520
Whenever there's trouble, he always gets away unscathed.

476
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
He quietly watches as his friends, trusting him,

477
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,839
step into danger.

478
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,760
You

479
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,760
"The Fool for Love"

480
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
I heard there's a "Fool for Love" in the club.

481
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
He loves someone deeply.

482
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,920
He paved every path for that person.

483
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,080
He gently said, "Don't be afraid."

484
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
"I'll always be with you."

485
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
He's afraid that person will run away.

486
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,440
That's him, the "Fool for Love."

487
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,000
That's you.

488
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,720
You won't distance yourself from me because of this, right?

489
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,000
Just kidding.

490
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
I want to ask you a question.

491
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,520
Did you really fall in love with her later?

492
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,840
You keep asking irrelevant questions now.

493
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,600
Because I want to know.

494
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,760
Is he the "Fool for Love"?

495
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
Because maybe he did it to get back at me.

496
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
Then he's devoted to you.

497
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,240
No, if anyone's devoted, he's even more so.

498
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,920
It's obvious devotion.

499
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,960
I didn't.

500
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
I actually didn't like her that much.

501
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,480
Because I dated other people later.

502
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,120
I really didn't tell you about this.

503
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,600
No.

504
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
Because I didn't think it was necessary to tell you.

505
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,960
Because what happens between us

506
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,120
is just between us.

507
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,160
But yes, I admit it.

508
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,440
Alright, we'll discuss your ethics later.

509
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Let's talk about ethics later.

510
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,560
Ning, you'll lose this round.

511
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
You'll lose this round.

512
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,000
What do you mean?

513
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,960
Can you be the good guy today?

514
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,320
I am X.

515
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,400
X is me.

516
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,600
You look like it.

517
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,600
I really don't understand you right now.

518
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,400
So I don't want to bother

519
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,320
with your stuff anymore.

520
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,640
I can't believe you didn't choose me.

521
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,920
You chose Zhang Linghe instead.

522
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,720
No, if I chose you,

523
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,400
that would be too predictable.

524
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,520
Don't you think so?

525
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,120
Right?

526
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,440
You need to be unexpected like this.

527
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,120
Didn't you say you would pick me as X?

528
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,720
So why didn't you?

529
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
You're not X.

530
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
He asked everyone one by one.

531
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,920
He just asked me the same thing.

532
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay.

533
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,120
He actually dared to ask both of us.

534
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,520
Seriously, he's just picking on us.

535
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,080
Yeah.

536
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,000
Seriously.

537
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,600
There's something off about your look.

538
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,760
What look?

539
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,560
A bit...

540
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
Look over there.

541
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
Okay.

542
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,560
They're all starting to acknowledge each other.

543
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I can use this phrase anytime

544
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:34,880
Sure.

545
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,920
to remind myself, maybe write a memo.

546
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,640
Remind myself, yeah.

547
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,920
Don't be fooled by so-called

548
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,120
appearances.

549
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,040
I must stick to what I truly believe

550
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
deep down.

551
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,440
Don't let yourself be swayed.

552
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,920
The person next to you

553
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,760
has taken my seat.

554
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
He's holding a bouquet of roses.

555
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
So it feels this good to slack off, huh?

556
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,320
When did I slack off?

557
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
He might already know

558
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
who the culprit is.

559
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Because he's already partnered with him, right?

560
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,240
No wonder.

561
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
But don't you think his state today

562
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,720
doesn't seem like X?

563
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,680
I think he does seem like X.

564
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,320
Like X.

565
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Alright, stick to your opinion.

566
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
Let's wait and see.

567
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,560
X

568
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
I don't think there's an X.

569
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,280
Don't say things like that.

570
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,320
There must be an X.

571
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,680
The culprit won't be that bold again.

572
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
Wasn't it chosen last time?

573
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,600
There was last time.

574
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Hasn't it always been there?

575
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,080
It's always been there.

576
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
I don't think he's X.

577
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,640
Don't say whether I am or not.

578
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,600
Just clarify yourself first.

579
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm not X.

580
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,720
Alright.

581
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,840
You're probably X, no doubt about it.

582
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,040
Zhang Linghe, based on what I know about you,

583
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
You've already known me for three seasons.

584
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,600
But not deeply enough.

585
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,760
Because I know whether you are or not.

586
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,440
You're starting to claim you know again.

587
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,680
Trying to frame me again, huh?

588
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,160
Alright, yes.

589
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,640
Can I use an analogy like this?

590
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,280
Using people as an analogy.

591
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,880
For example,

592
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
Ba thinks I killed her friend.

593
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,320
So I am the person with the alternate account.

594
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,720
I talk about things in that company.

595
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
Like, what the boss is doing.

596
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,000
Then Ba keeps asking about me.

597
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Because she knows

598
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,800
I killed her friend.

599
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,920
Right.

600
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,200
Isn't that so?

601
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,440
Yes.

602
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,280
So she (Ba Mian Linglong) knows

603
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,480
that after I started asking about the boss,

604
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
she (Ba Mian Linglong) went to the office

605
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
and switched the ghost that belonged to me

606
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
with the deadly ghost.

607
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,360
Right.

608
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,960
What does she (Ba Mian Linglong) want to do?

609
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,120
She (Ba Mian Linglong) wants you

610
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
to go kill someone.

611
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,640
So basically, this is using someone else to do your dirty work.

612
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
The boss ends up dead,

613
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,360
and at the same time,

614
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,800
the person who killed your friend also dies.

615
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,640
That's killing two birds with one stone.

616
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,360
The killer's logic is,

617
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,680
is the person who actually does it the murderer,

618
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,360
or

619
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,320
is the one who directly causes the death the murderer?

620
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,360
I have a question.

621
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,640
Go ahead.

622
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,000
If we follow this logic,

623
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
what if I find someone really stupid,

624
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
and I have to teach you how to do it?

625
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,160
So there's one person

626
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,280
who instigates another,

627
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,320
teaching them how to kill someone.

628
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
If I instigate you,

629
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,800
does that mean I'm not a murderer?

630
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,840
Why is it that only the one who directly causes the death

631
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
is considered the murderer?

632
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
I think your logic is too weak.

633
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,120
If you want to say

634
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,160
there are two people involved,

635
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,600
you can't just say the one who caused the death

636
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,440
is the only murderer.

637
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,360
It has to be both.

638
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,160
This is a legal issue,

639
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,480
and a moral one too.

640
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,360
Instigating murder

641
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
is still murder, isn't it?

642
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,560
Good detective.

643
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,600
Why are you so concerned about joint liability?

644
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,120
Are you the one who taught them?

645
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Let me tell you.

646
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
The reason I'm so concerned about this matter

647
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,160
is because he just said

648
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,080
that the instigator doesn't need to take any responsibility.

649
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,400
That statement really bothered me.

650
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,080
Yes, I think he's protecting someone.

651
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,560
Right.

652
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,400
Protecting the instigator.

653
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,680
Right.

654
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Both are guilty.

655
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,520
The only ones who know I've caused someone's death

656
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,360
are probably Ning and Jin.

657
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,040
Ning seemed uneasy today.

658
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,160
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

659
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
You seem a little uncomfortable, I feel.

660
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,440
I really think you're both nervous and uneasy.

661
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,920
Alright.

662
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
Wait, he is—

663
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,760
You know, from my angle

664
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
I can see this side of his face.

665
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,040
The veins on this side are bulging.

666
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,600
I heard a story today

667
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
about a coward.

668
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
When danger came, he chose to run away.

669
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,800
He let his friend face all the disaster alone.

670
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
I think it was him.

671
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,440
You kind of count as one too.

672
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,240
Why?

673
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,600
I called you and asked you to come save me.

674
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,680
But you didn't come either.

675
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,120
It's him, the lovesick fool.

676
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,080
You won't stay away from me because of this, will you?

677
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,440
It's you.

678
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,440
I think the instigator is him.

679
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,080
The inquirer wants to kill the boss.

680
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,920
Right.

681
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,560
Then there's a problem.

682
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
The inquirer, from beginning to end,

683
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,520
has always had a grudge against the boss.

684
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,560
Yes, that's the logic.

685
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
He was already dissatisfied with the boss.

686
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
Right, so what I want to say is,

687
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
who has the relationship where

688
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,800
"I've wanted to kill the boss for a long time"?

689
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,200
The two of them are so closely connected to you

690
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,040
It's entirely possible

691
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,720
What they did to their friend

692
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,640
You know about it

693
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,560
One is your best friend

694
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,520
The other is your boyfriend

695
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,800
How could you not know?

696
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
Are you two also involved?

697
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,000
No

698
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,840
But about him killing someone

699
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
The two of them don't know

700
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,760
Only you two know

701
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,280
How would we know?

702
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,960
You also know he switched people

703
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,400
I didn't know he switched people

704
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,680
Because before I went to find him

705
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,920
I didn't know who he was

706
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,080
Do you understand?

707
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,000
So he brought the wrong person

708
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
I didn't know it wasn't him who came

709
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,160
I don't know who he (Ning Que Wu Lan) is

710
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,680
Do you understand?

711
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
So he brought the wrong person

712
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
I didn't know it wasn't him (Ning Que Wu Lan) who came

713
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,560
That's obvious then

714
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,560
Who?

715
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,480
Her

716
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
Only those two know each other well

717
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,640
These things did happen

718
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
You're her assistant

719
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,160
Everyone at school knows about this

720
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Yes

721
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,360
There are two suspects for the real culprit today.

722
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Ning should be the instigator.

723
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,200
Ke should be the killer.

724
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,800
I think Ningquewulan is the culprit.

725
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Kebanchushen is his accomplice.

726
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
The real culprit is

727
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,320
Kebanchushen.

728
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
He has an accomplice.

729
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
That is his instigator.

730
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
I chose

731
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,960
Ningquewulan.

732
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
My final vote is

733
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
The instigator is

734
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,040
Jin.

735
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,160
The perpetrator is

736
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,360
myself.

737
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,920
The suspect I voted for as the real culprit is

738
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,040
Ningquewulan.

739
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,600
And then

740
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,920
Jinzizhaopai.

741
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,120
has been constantly egging him on.

742
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,360
Today, I am voting for

743
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,400
Jin

744
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
as the instigator of the murder.

745
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,080
Ning as the direct killer.

746
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,160
The culprit for this case

747
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,200
was not identified.

748
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,320
The instigator is

749
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,480
Ningquewulan.

750
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
The person who committed the act is

751
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,840
Kebanchushen.

752
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,840
Winning this round feels so good, bro.

753
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,320
So satisfying.

754
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,120
Was there any X in today's case?

755
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,560
No.

756
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,720
No X.

757
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Did you make that shot?

758
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,840
That one...

759
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,000
That's basically a street scam.

760
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,520
Right?

761
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
You can't get it in at all.

762
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,920
It just bounces everywhere.

763
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,320
It's impossible to make it.

764
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,280
It's the same as those street ring toss games.

765
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,640
So, no X then.

766
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,720
Yeah, I only got one in.

767
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,800
Who should be today's MVP?

768
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,600
What do you think?

769
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,360
Give it to Zhang Linghe.

770
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,880
I guessed right, but I didn't...

771
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,640
I didn't explain the logic clearly.

772
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
So I think it was a bit lacking.

773
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
I hope in the next case,

774
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
I can get it right.

775
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,480
And also

776
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,000
express the correct logic.

777
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
But it's normal if I can't express it.

778
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
I think I'll give it to

779
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll choose Lao Bai, right?

780
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,400
Because from the start,

781
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,120
he targeted me.

782
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,720
And he was unwavering the whole time.

783
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,080
He even wrote in his notebook

784
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,400
that the culprit is Ning.

785
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,440
He already wrote it down.

786
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
So whether it was luck, guessing,

787
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,640
or intuition, from every angle,

788
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,000
he locked onto the culprit from the beginning.

789
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
And his final vote

790
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,920
was also for me, and he was right.

791
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
Because from start to finish,

792
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,880
he was the only one who believed I was the mastermind.

793
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,840
Even though I don't know where that confidence came from,

794
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,920
he just stuck to his conviction.

795
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
That proves that from beginning to end,

796
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,240
he never made the wrong choice.

797
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,880
It should be me and Ning, right?

798
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,640
I think the two of us

799
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,040
worked together pretty well.

800
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
I think the MVP this time

801
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,440
should go to Ning.

802
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,840
Because he was the accomplice,

803
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,720
and he created

804
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,760
a motive for the killer.

805
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,720
He made the killer

806
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,160
take action on his own.

807
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,320
So I think in this round,

808
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,560
his move was really clever.

809
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,280
And in the later stages

810
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,000
of the deduction process,

811
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
he also did very well.

812
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,240
Although everyone

813
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,040
in the end

814
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,400
had some differences

815
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,000
in their choices,

816
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,920
his performance this episode

817
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,160
broke my previous impression

818
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
of him as just a "hidden talent."

819
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,840
That’s Ning.

820
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,200
I think the most impressive one

821
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,280
is Zhang Linghe.

822
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,800
He has a background in acting.

823
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,600
Because I never expected

824
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,280
where his obsession came from.
