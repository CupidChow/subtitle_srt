00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,400
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,480
An unknown fog shrouds the city of deduction.

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,400
Players will experience

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,920
In each investigation, six players are divided into

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,360
detectives, suspects, and the real culprit.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,200
The real culprit's task is to hide their identity

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,880
and avoid being discovered by other players.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,160
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,560
If the culprit passes a challenge,

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,800
they can choose one detective

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
to turn them into X.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Once blackened, X joins the culprit's team.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
During the subsequent investigation,

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
X works to help the culprit escape.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
After the investigation, players vote for the real culprit.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,080
If the culprit receives fewer votes than the other suspects,

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
the culprit and X win the golden key.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Otherwise,

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
the other players who voted correctly win the golden key.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Every time the bell rings

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,000
we have to open the corresponding exhibit

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,760
Boss

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,880
The boss is dead

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,760
He just wanted to change his identity

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Pushing the new generation is just pushing out the old

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,880
He just wants us

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,400
to finish that whole sequence just now

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,440
He made us get on that ship

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,720
and then made us go as sacrifices

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
So we have to dress

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,840
exactly like his ancestors

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
And also

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
we still haven't found our treasure

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,400
On the mysterious island

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,760
is the treasure left by Lady Tui San

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,920
The boss told me to sink everyone on the ship

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
The boss of the old generation

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,120
ordered him to become the captain

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
the one who would steer this ship

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
When I came back again

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
I found that the mother and daughter

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
had disappeared

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,480
Someone came in

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
wearing glow-in-the-dark clothes

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm Ren Weishan

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
The new generation sent me

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
You all

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,840
what blood type are you?

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm a little hungry.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
Let's have a late-night snack then.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,960
Let's get together.

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,440
Okay.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,200
In the banquet hall.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,920
We'll have a late-night snack.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,360
Alright.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,720
Okay.

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
No problem.

58
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,600
Come on, everyone.

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,320
There's food.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,800
Let's eat then.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
This is delicious.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
This skewer looks really tasty.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,080
Everyone, come down quickly.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,680
I used tools

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
and opened all your windows.

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Everyone, come down quickly.

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,560
I used tools

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,480
and opened all your windows.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
Come down quickly.

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,040
Coming.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,720
What?

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
Wait, my door is locked.

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
Why should I come down?

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm locked in.

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,200
Everyone has to jump out the window.

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,520
Jump out the window.

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Jump out the window.

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,520
Okay.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,080
Who locked me in here?

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,280
I was just locked in too.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
Jump out the window of your room.

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,480
Let's go.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,760
What time is it now?

84
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,840
It's not even light out yet.

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,400
Why did you wake us up?

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,040
I just checked, it's only four o'clock.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,640
Yeah.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,480
What's wrong?

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,440
I heard a strange noise.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
I was sleeping too.

91
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,800
But I heard a strange noise.

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,200
So I wondered what was going on.

93
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,600
I tried to open the door and go out.

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Then I found the door was locked.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
So I grabbed an axe.

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,720
I broke open my window.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,640
Then I went to each of your windows

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,280
and pried them open.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,280
Everyone's door was locked.

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,120
Everyone was locked in.

101
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
Yeah.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,640
Who locked them?

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Let's go outside and check.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
Go out and take a look.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
Stop! What are you doing?

106
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't move.

107
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,600
What are you doing?

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,680
What are you doing?

109
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,280
What do you want?

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,680
What are you doing?

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,360
What do you want?

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,360
What do you want?

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,120
We should still...

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,040
Wait a moment.

115
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Hold on.

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,200
Don't move.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Stand still.

118
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Hit him.

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,280
Come on, everyone stand properly.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Wait, are you...

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,480
I'm Ren Weishan.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,560
Tui Houlang sent me here.

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
You want to join us, right?

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,920
I have to join you.

125
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Then stand up there.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,680
Okay.

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,360
Stand properly.

128
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
He wants to join them.

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,240
With that black outfit, you really can't tell.

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,520
What are you guys doing?

131
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,080
They're ignoring you.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Come back.

133
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Betraying so quickly, huh?

134
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,280
I'll stop talking about your business for now.

135
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,440
I have a bit of a problem.

136
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
When I see things out of order,

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
I feel uncomfortable all over.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Including you all.

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Everyone, follow my command and turn right.

140
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,200
Wait a second.

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,560
You can tell left from right, right?

142
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes.

143
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Alright, turn left.

144
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,800
Two-person turn.

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Two-person turn.

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,040
Good, not bad. Got it.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you, teacher.

148
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,960
Alright, since you came forward about this,

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
I’ll let bygones be bygones.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,520
I keep my word.

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
Our boss, Ren Weishan,

152
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,480
last night, did he

153
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,440
check in here?

154
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,720
Yes, room 201.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
And after that, did he

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,000
have a late-night snack with you?

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,440
Yes.

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,040
That's right.

159
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,120
So after he finished the snack,

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,200
how did he just disappear?

161
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Impossible.

162
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,680
Was it you who got rid of him?

163
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,720
Impossible.

164
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,280
Why would we get rid of him?

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
We went to sleep.

166
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,280
How do you know he disappeared?

167
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
That means you didn't watch him properly.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,720
You two security guards were responsible for his safety.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
We're here to have fun too.

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,280
Everyone's here to have fun.

171
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,920
What's there to be so uptight about?

172
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,920
Our boss wanted to go out for a late-night snack.

173
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,840
We told the boss,

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
let's go together.

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,400
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

177
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
I think you just can't bring yourself to say it.

178
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Then you can only...

179
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,560
But my biggest trait is

180
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,080
I never waste energy on myself.

181
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
I never blame myself.

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
That's right, don't wear yourself out.

183
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah, I never blame myself.

184
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay.

185
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,040
Here's what happened.

186
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,360
We were all locked in just now.

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,120
All of us were locked in.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,800
The boss had a late-night snack with you last night.

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,720
And then disappeared.

190
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,280
Yes.

191
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,880
Right, that's why I locked you all in.

192
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,400
You locked us in?

193
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
You locked us in?

194
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes.

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,680
Come on, one against two.

196
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
I've searched both the main building and the annex.

197
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,080
There's no one there.

198
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,360
If you want to redeem yourselves,

199
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,760
then go

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,880
outside the building

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,520
and look around.

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,040
Alright.

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,200
Okay.

204
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,440
The rest of you, go surround the mansion.

205
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,320
Got it.

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,640
Come on, let's hurry and search, everyone.

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,520
Let's go.

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,640
Please take this boat to go over.

209
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,320
What's wrong?

210
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,480
You startled me.

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,440
Your boss is here.

212
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,960
Found him.

213
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
The boss has been found.

214
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
What boss?

215
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,200
What do you mean?

216
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,760
Come here.

217
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,760
What's going on?

218
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
Take a look at what's happening.

219
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,600
Someone, come here!

220
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Come!

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
What do you mean someone? They're already here.

222
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
You guys, pull him up.

223
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,040
How do we fish this out? Do we have to get off the boat?

224
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
Get him.

225
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,000
Grab those tools.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,640
Get the tools.

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,280
Bring the pole over.

228
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,400
Be careful.

229
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,760
It's fine, I'll step on this.

230
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
Then I'll pull you.

231
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,200
The boss is here.

232
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,640
The boss is here, hurry!

233
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
Come, put it here.

234
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Boss.

235
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,840
It really is the boss.

236
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,440
Boss, why are you... silicone?

237
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,880
No.

238
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,360
He's passed away.

239
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,480
Boss.

240
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,160
The boss is already dead.

241
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,440
So now I have to be the boss, right?

242
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,080
No, are you really in such a hurry, Second Brother?

243
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,800
Don't you want to go from zero-zero-eight

244
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
to zero-zero-seven, zero-zero-six?

245
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,920
I do.

246
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,000
If you do, then smile.

247
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,720
Come on.

248
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
Help the boss up.

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,440
Okay.

250
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,760
Right?

251
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay.

252
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
I mean, I...

253
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,920
Yeah.

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,520
You two, come here.

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,120
Hurry and carry the boss's body away.

256
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,800
You guys.

257
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,120
Come back to the mansion with me first.

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's go.

259
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,160
Alright.

260
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
Come on.

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,960
Thanks for your hard work.

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,440
I think all of you are a bit suspicious right now.

263
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,680
Unless any of you have something

264
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
that can prove your own innocence.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
I do.

266
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,880
Prove what?

267
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,920
At that time yesterday.

268
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,200
I have a record of it.

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,880
I left at 11:20.

270
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,040
You all stayed in the restaurant at that time.

271
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,440
My sleep tracker shows that I

272
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,680
was asleep from 11:25 to 3:55.

273
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,440
I was sleeping the whole time.

274
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,840
Okay.

275
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
Then you take the lead.

276
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,560
Investigate our boss's case thoroughly.

277
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,440
Alright.

278
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,120
By the way, there's something important.

279
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,600
It's very important.

280
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
Puzzle-solving and reasoning test.

281
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
Tongcheng is fully online.

282
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,280
This is a tool prepared for everyone by Tongcheng Travel.

283
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
It's an evidence search assistant tool.

284
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,040
We hope it can help everyone

285
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,880
organize information and clues,

286
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,480
clarify the logical connections,

287
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,240
and explore the truth at every moment.

288
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,800
Let's set off together with Tongcheng.

289
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,960
I'll just leave it here.

290
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,920
Thank you.

291
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you.

292
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,720
Alright.

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
At dawn, I'll arrange for someone to do the autopsy.

294
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,440
We'll head out first.

295
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,360
Thank you.

296
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,320
It's nothing.

297
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,120
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

298
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
Case Four officially begins

299
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,760
It is now the year 2025

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,320
March 15th, 4:30 PM

301
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,800
The victim in this case is Ren Weishan

302
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
After a preliminary investigation

303
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,920
The suspects have been narrowed down to

304
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,680
Ning Jiedai

305
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,000
Baizhihua

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,520
He Chongchong

307
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,040
Ke Wuwang

308
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,760
Jin Shangbao

309
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
Among these five people

310
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,560
Ba Jiaoshan, because at 11:20

311
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
left the banquet hall

312
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
can be completely ruled out as a suspect

313
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,160
Therefore, is the detective for this case

314
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,120
Therefore, is the detective for this case

315
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
Now, the detective will lead the suspects

316
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,520
to begin collecting evidence

317
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
Let's take turns

318
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,400
talking about our relationship with the boss

319
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,680
Okay

320
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay

321
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,160
I met the boss for the first time yesterday

322
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,160
It was here

323
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,840
The second time was for a late-night snack

324
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Same as me

325
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Met for the first time yesterday

326
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Had dinner together in the evening

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,600
Me too

328
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,160
First time meeting, had a meal together, that's all

329
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,560
It was also my first time meeting him

330
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm the same as you all

331
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
So our statements are all the same for now

332
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,040
Now let's talk about

333
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,440
everyone's timeline from last night

334
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,280
So at 11:20,

335
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,040
I wasn't feeling well.

336
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Because I ate too much yesterday.

337
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,520
I went back to my room to sleep.

338
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
At 3:55,

339
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I suddenly heard

340
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,040
a very strange sound.

341
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,880
A strange noise.

342
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,160
Then I wondered what it was.

343
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,760
So I came out.

344
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,240
And the door was just like everyone saw earlier.

345
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,920
The door was locked.

346
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,600
I left at 11:20.

347
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
You all stayed in the dining room.

348
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,240
Stayed there.

349
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,400
Stayed there.

350
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, that's right.

351
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Yes.

352
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Yes.

353
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,880
I went for a late-night snack at 10:30.

354
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,440
10:30.

355
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,240
Wait, let me write this down.

356
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,040
Late-night snack at 10:30.

357
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,960
Twenty minutes later,

358
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,400
the boss arrived.

359
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,520
(10:)50.

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
Yes, then we ate for thirty minutes.

361
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,920
Then you said you weren't feeling well.

362
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,800
And you left.

363
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,360
11:20.

364
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,520
Then when we looked back,

365
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Ren Weishan was gone.

366
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,880
After I left at 11:20,

367
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,760
he disappeared too.

368
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes, that's right.

369
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,800
Then the five of us ate for another forty minutes.

370
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,280
Forty minutes.

371
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,840
Then we went back together.

372
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
The two of us had exactly the same experience.

373
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,840
Wrong, completely wrong.

374
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,200
Alright, you tell your side.

375
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Go ahead.

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,840
We had dinner together at 10:30.

377
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,840
And then?

378
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,720
Twenty minutes later,

379
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
the boss arrived.

380
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,320
Right.

381
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,960
After thirty minutes,

382
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
she said she wanted to go home.

383
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,120
She went home.

384
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,760
We kept eating for another forty minutes.

385
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,640
Then we left, the rest of us left.

386
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,680
But when we looked back, the boss was still there.

387
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,360
Where was he?

388
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
Still sitting there eating.

389
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,800
Mine was exactly the same as his.

390
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,880
Mine was exactly the same as his too.

391
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,760
There's a difference.

392
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,560
When did he leave?

393
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
Alright, today the culprit is a direct one out of two.

394
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
That's enough, no need to say more.

395
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,160
What?

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,520
Why?

397
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
Why isn't it one out of three?

398
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,560
Why isn't it you three as the options?

399
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,360
Classic one out of two.

400
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,120
Classic one out of two.

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
You're talking about TV dramas, classic tropes.

402
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,240
Alright, let's search together.

403
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,560
What does the victim have on them?

404
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,000
There's blood here.

405
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,240
There's some on the neck too.

406
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,840
Look, there's some on his hands as well.

407
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,360
Both hands have it.

408
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,400
So right now, it seems like he probably

409
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,480
threw two punches.

410
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,600
But this on his hand looks like a scrape.

411
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah.

412
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,920
It's just an abrasion.

413
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,840
I think it's a dragging injury, probably.

414
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
I mean, he was already unconscious.

415
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,160
It must be like this, it's everywhere.

416
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,960
Yeah, I agree with what she said.

417
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,040
What you said makes sense too.

418
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,560
So it means he was injured by being hit.

419
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's keep looking.

420
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
The watch can record.

421
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,599
This won't open.

422
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,640
What about the outer pocket of the jacket?

423
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,920
There's something.

424
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,160
There's something here, wait a second.

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,880
Open it.

426
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay.

427
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,280
The key to 201 is on him.

428
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,040
His room key.

429
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,360
Room.

430
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,560
Then let's search his room.

431
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,040
Let's go.

432
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,640
Let's check out 201 first.

433
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,840
Let's go.

434
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,200
Ren Weishan.

435
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,600
Key.

436
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,440
Here.

437
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Come in, let's collect evidence.

438
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,240
Take a look.

439
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,480
This painting is...

440
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,200
B.

441
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
This painting is white.

442
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
These are three white paintings.

443
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,080
Explain it.

444
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,680
I am the Painting Sage.

445
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,560
I've seen some of your paintings.

446
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,600
I can buy them at a high price.

447
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,720
He's the Painting Sage, right?

448
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,280
Yes.

449
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
Painting Sage.

450
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,160
There must be a hidden meaning in this painting.

451
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,480
What does "A T P" mean?

452
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,400
A P T.

453
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
APT, APT.

454
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,520
After you dance this dance,

455
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,680
you'll be told what it means.

456
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
No, you go.

457
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,000
You have to join too.

458
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,320
The paintings you drew.

459
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,560
Your paintings.

460
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
Okay.

461
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,440
Come on.

462
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,480
Come on.

463
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,960
Let's all do "APT" together, come on.

464
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,400
Who knows it? Who will start?

465
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,160
He feels like he's already dancing.

466
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
I am.

467
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,840
I've never danced it.

468
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,680
Teach us, come on.

469
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Come on.

470
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,320
We only need to know two moves.

471
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,240
I don't know what the moves are either.

472
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,880
But I'll just make something up.

473
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,560
This move.

474
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,920
Then like this.

475
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,080
One, two, three, four.

476
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,760
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay.

477
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,720
Alright, let's repeat this.

478
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,360
Okay, let's go.

479
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,320
Alright, that's simple.

480
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,560
Come on, Five, Six, Seven, go!

481
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,400
APT APT

482
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,200
APT APT

483
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
APT APT

484
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,680
APT APT

485
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,480
APT APT

486
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
APT APT

487
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,040
Why aren't you moving your feet?

488
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
APT APT

489
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,160
APT APT

490
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,920
APT APT

491
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,520
APT APT

492
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,240
APT APT

493
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
APT APT

494
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
APT APT

495
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
It's an earthquake!

496
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
What is this? An earthquake?

497
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,800
What, what, what is it?

498
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,480
It's gone.

499
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
So after we finish dancing,

500
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,640
what clues will we get?

501
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,400
If there's no reward today, I'm telling you,

502
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll just put this painting right on your head.

503
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,280
You're not really messing with us, are you?

504
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,640
Yes.

505
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Yes.

506
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,520
APT APT

507
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
APT APT

508
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,840
APT APT

509
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,720
I just feel like

510
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,800
everyone's a bit low on energy right now.

511
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
You're kind of like those phone stores

512
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
where the employees come out and dance in the morning.

513
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,080
That kind of vibe.

514
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
Are you trying to get us pumped up?

515
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,680
Aren't you?

516
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,760
Let's go!

517
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,360
Come on!

518
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Money, please!

519
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,920
Come on, keep going!

520
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,880
There's something here.

521
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,400
What?

522
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,640
Come.

523
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,480
This is a report about him.

524
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,720
Ren Weishan, Chairman of Tuixian Group.

525
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
A legendary journey of wealth and philanthropy.

526
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,040
Tuixian Group has already entered the fields of cultural relics and real estate,

527
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
as well as tourism, medicine, beauty, and other industries.

528
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,280
It has become an important force in the business world.

529
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
Rumor has it

530
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,320
that years ago, he found the female pirate

531
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Tuiniang's treasure island

532
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
and took the island's treasure for himself.

533
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,040
Although outsiders

534
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,160
have many criticisms of Mr. Ren Weishan,

535
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,040
it cannot be denied

536
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,680
that he is a successful entrepreneur

537
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,960
who actively participates in charity work

538
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,800
and has brought a lot of positive energy to Tui City.

539
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,000
So, he's a good person.

540
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,240
We haven't gone inside yet.

541
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,720
Let's go in and take a look.

542
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,000
What a big bedroom.

543
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,600
His suitcase is here.

544
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
Something is missing.

545
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,120
I finally found something.

546
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
So cool.

547
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,560
Really.

548
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,920
Come take a look, there's a message on WeChat.

549
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,320
Lingling sent him three paintings.

550
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,880
These are your paintings, right?

551
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,880
Yes.

552
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,560
There's also one from Mr. Qin.

553
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
March 13th, 1 PM.

554
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
He said, "I'm Mr. Ren, trust me."

555
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,880
"I'll definitely give you a great experience."

556
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,960
Who is the person with the surname Qin?

557
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Has anyone with the surname Qin appeared so far?

558
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,440
No.

559
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,800
Okay.

560
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Shall we check his balance?

561
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,040
Okay.

562
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Payments and receipts.

563
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,040
The payment function hasn't been enabled yet.

564
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Then what is that message?

565
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,400
This is the message you sent him.

566
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,200
I've had some new inspiration lately.

567
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
How about March 15th?

568
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,280
Let's meet at Pirate Mansion.

569
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,320
Right.

570
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,480
Based on this clue,

571
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,080
it means that

572
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,200
he came to this mansion because of you.

573
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Yes, that's right.

574
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,040
They're going to Bai's room.

575
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,560
Alright, okay.

576
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,800
Okay, let's go then.

577
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,280
Welcome to my space.

578
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
Bedroom.

579
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,920
What do these three paintings mean?

580
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
This is n.

581
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
The three paintings from just now.

582
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
Yes, the ones in the phone.

583
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,080
Yes.

584
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,480
Right.

585
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,360
So someone snuck into your room.

586
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,680
Yes.

587
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
Phone.

588
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,600
You are Ling Ling Fa.

589
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,960
You are Ling Ling Fa.

590
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,160
What?

591
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,520
What is that?

592
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,240
He is Ling Ling Fa.

593
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm not Ling Ling Fa.

594
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,720
Then where did this phone come from?

595
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,560
This phone belongs to Ling Ling Fa.

596
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,200
Wait.

597
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,360
Wait.

598
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,080
What is this?

599
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,240
You robbed Ling Ling Fa.

600
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,000
The boss said to Ling Ling Fa,

601
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,320
Baizhihua seems to have remembered something.

602
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,920
I need to check the situation myself.

603
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,760
You can't be soft-hearted when doing big things.

604
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,200
I must kill him.

605
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,320
To eliminate future trouble.

606
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,480
Now that things have come to this,

607
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
I can only tell my story.

608
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,400
Go ahead.

609
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,360
After we finished,

610
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,640
before we had dinner,

611
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,760
I was about to return to my room.

612
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,560
On my way back,

613
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,080
I saw two people wearing those cloaks.

614
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,000
The two people with masks.

615
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,160
Cloaked and masked.

616
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
But in the restaurant, we only saw one person.

617
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,960
Not wearing a cloak.

618
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,280
Who is that?

619
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,520
Wearing a glow-in-the-dark outfit.

620
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,960
So we only saw one.

621
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,760
But on the way back yesterday,

622
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,440
I saw two.

623
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,840
So I followed them all the way.

624
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,720
Up to the second floor.

625
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,280
I chased them to the second floor.

626
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,360
Then I found that both of them had disappeared.

627
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
I looked around.

628
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,080
When I got to the boss's door,

629
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,720
there was a gap.

630
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,080
The door was open.

631
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,640
I pushed the door open.

632
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,680
I went into the boss's room.

633
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I saw my three paintings.

634
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,240
I understood immediately.

635
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,480
So the boss is the mysterious painting buyer.

636
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
But what I'm really curious about is

637
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,160
why he wrote those letters

638
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,120
on my paintings.

639
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,720
I thought there must be something wrong with him.

640
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,040
Then I heard his walkie-talkie go off.

641
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,480
Someone said, "Boss, boss,"

642
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,920
"I found the painting in Bai's room,"

643
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
or something like that.

644
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,520
"Should we get rid of him?"

645
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,160
Or something like that.

646
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,720
As soon as I heard it, I said,

647
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,640
What does this have to do with me?

648
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,400
Are they trying to get rid of me?

649
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,440
What exactly are you all trying to do?

650
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,080
So I thought I'd go back to my room

651
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,040
and block this Ling Ling Fa

652
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,240
to ask him clearly

653
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,680
I ambushed him at my room door

654
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Sure enough, he came out

655
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,000
I caught him off guard

656
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
with an uppercut

657
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,720
but I missed

658
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,120
and hit myself on the head with the uppercut

659
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,720
I hit myself

660
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,880
I hit myself

661
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,600
After hitting myself on the head with the uppercut

662
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
I was instantly dazed for three seconds

663
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,000
Dazed for three seconds

664
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,480
When I adjusted myself and got ready to chase

665
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,800
he had already run away

666
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,240
But his phone and walkie-talkie

667
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,760
maybe were left behind because I scared him

668
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,680
were left on the spot

669
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,720
Then I checked his phone

670
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,080
and their records

671
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,880
I found out the boss wanted to kill me

672
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,800
So I thought

673
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,680
maybe I should

674
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,000
fight back and take him out too

675
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,520
I went to his room to look for him at ten o'clock.

676
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,560
I wanted to kill him.

677
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,640
I knocked for a long time, but no one answered.

678
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,680
Then at ten thirty, I went to the appointment.

679
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,120
Your motive for murder is clear now.

680
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,640
It's because you thought he wanted to kill you.

681
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,600
So you had to protect yourself.

682
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,240
Obviously, yes.

683
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,920
No problem.

684
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,120
This is very simple.

685
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,000
A very straightforward motive for murder.

686
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,360
Very direct.

687
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,600
Yes.

688
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
As for these letters on here,

689
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,160
it's because I saw the painting in the boss's room.

690
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,480
There were letters on it.

691
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,920
I wanted to see

692
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,480
if this

693
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,200
had anything to do with my memory.

694
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,560
So I tried to find

695
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,000
three letters in my own painting.

696
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,720
And I actually found them.

697
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I really did find them.

698
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
I took these six letters

699
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
and rearranged them.

700
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,080
I rearranged them.

701
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,160
There are two possibilities.

702
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,080
One is "parents".

703
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,840
The other word is very uncommon.

704
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,640
"Enchanted" or "infatuated".

705
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,400
I'm completely captivated.

706
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
My restless heart feels like it's setting off fireworks.

707
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
It just makes me feel really strange.

708
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,320
This diagonal, this symbol—

709
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,600
After I saw these paintings,

710
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,560
a pattern suddenly appeared in my mind.

711
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,360
Then I thought it was very strange.

712
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,280
So I drew it out.

713
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,840
Does anyone find this symbol familiar?

714
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,560
I think it looks very familiar.

715
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,360
What is it?

716
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,720
It's because on my—

717
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,120
My skirt also has this symbol on it.

718
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,840
My grass skirt.

719
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
Is this some kind of symbol from your island?

720
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

721
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
So that's why it's called Shenhundian Island.

722
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,600
Six years ago, I woke up in a cave.

723
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
Baba Liu happily told me

724
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,000
that he had found a boat

725
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,640
that could take us off this island.

726
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,040
Your island is called Shenhundian Island?

727
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,800
Yes.

728
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,960
Let's keep searching.

729
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,560
Okay.

730
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,880
Let's go check Baba's room.

731
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,600
Okay.

732
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
Let's go take a look in her room.

733
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,840
Wait, who is it?

734
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,680
Don't.

735
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
It's fine.

736
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
It's fine.

737
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,440
Hide in the room, it's safe inside.

738
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,360
Why is someone screaming?

739
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,320
Who are you?

740
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,440
Hurry up and go.

741
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
There's no one behind you anymore.

742
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,360
No.

743
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,440
How come there's no one left?

744
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,920
It's fine.

745
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,480
Then let's wait a bit.

746
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,840
Teacher Bai.

747
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
Did you go somewhere?

748
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,600
He went ghost hunting again.

749
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,160
Come here.

750
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,760
Did you go in?

751
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm in.

752
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,400
This is Ren Weishan's room.

753
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Yes, the one ahead is 201.

754
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,240
They're in Ren Weishan's room.

755
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
Come, this way.

756
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I'm so scared.

757
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't talk.

758
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,080
Don't be afraid.

759
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,920
Where is it?

760
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,160
Right here.

761
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,520
Who are you?

762
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,720
Boss.

763
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,600
Who are you?

764
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Who are you?

765
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,240
Second boss.

766
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,000
Who are you?

767
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,960
Ready, go.

768
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,040
We are...

769
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,200
Have you heard of us?

770
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,320
That's pretty impressive.

771
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,560
I'm really scared right now.

772
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,880
Go help me turn on the light.

773
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
Where's the light?

774
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,360
In the living room.

775
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,960
The switch next to the flowerpot.

776
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,000
I won't get shocked, right?

777
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,040
No, you won't.

778
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
I remember.

779
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,960
What does he want to do?

780
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,120
I'm here.

781
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,160
It's okay, I'll hold him back.

782
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm holding him back.

783
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,600
Okay, you hold him back.

784
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,520
You go hold him back yourself.

785
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
Why are you grabbing me? I'm really scared right now.

786
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,280
I knew he was here.

787
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,800
He's sitting here.

788
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I found it.

789
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Turn on the light.

790
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,480
It's on.

791
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,960
It's on, but why is it still so dark for me?

792
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,240
Open your eyes.

793
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,760
Open your eyes.

794
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,440
You guys.

795
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,200
Sit down.

796
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,240
There's an extra laptop here.

797
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,040
What's this for?

798
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,760
Why are you here?

799
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,360
Didn't the boss leave?

800
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,080
Those confidential files—

801
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,560
He didn't have time to hand them over to me.

802
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,480
When I came over,

803
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
the laptop was already on the table.

804
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,800
After I got here, I took it.

805
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,720
I wanted to look for some files.

806
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
When I opened it, there was a password.

807
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I couldn't unlock it either.

808
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,840
So I thought,

809
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,560
maybe I could unlock it with facial recognition.

810
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,160
So after I came over,

811
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,920
I wanted to use the hair dryer to style my hair.

812
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,960
I wanted to try facial recognition.

813
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
As soon as I plugged it in,

814
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,440
before I could use it, the power suddenly went out.

815
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,760
I was like, ah! I got scared.

816
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm afraid of the dark.

817
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,080
Right?

818
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,560
I think our brainstorming right now

819
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
isn't working anymore.

820
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
It's already early morning.

821
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
Let's sleep until nine in the morning.

822
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,480
No,

823
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
let's sleep until noon or even the afternoon.

824
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Alright, sounds good.

825
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,280
Okay.

826
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,920
Let's rest and recharge, then try again.

827
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,320
Let's rest up first.

828
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,720
Let's sleep.

829
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,080
Right.

830
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,480
Okay.

831
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,320
Let's go.

832
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
We ate quite a lot.

833
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Before we rested yesterday,

834
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,080
we were talking about Bajiaoshan's room.

835
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Let's check if there are any clues.

836
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,840
Come on, let's go check Ba's room.

837
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,360
What a coincidence.

838
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,760
Your look is great today.

839
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,920
Stop teasing me.

840
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,520
My hair got soaked in the rain yesterday.

841
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,440
I didn't take care of it in time, so it got all tangled.

842
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
Isn't that a coincidence?

843
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,080
I just happened to bring Pantene hair mask today.

844
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
It contains collagen.

845
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,000
It gives your hair intensive care.

846
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,080
Take good care of your hair

847
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,960
so it stays strong, resilient, and shiny.

848
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,080
That's so thoughtful.

849
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,880
Thank you.

850
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,719
Let's go.

851
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,120
Come and catch me.

852
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,040
Today's theme is

853
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,159
an ocean theme.

854
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,040
Hello.

855
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,400
Hello, Princess.

856
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,960
What about me?

857
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
You are the ocean.

858
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,080
You are the pearl.

859
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,880
I'll just wait for him.

860
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,760
Don't remind him, let him speak.

861
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,720
Mermaid.

862
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,840
Let's look at your mark first.

863
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,680
Didn't you say there was something familiar?

864
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,920
Yes.

865
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,040
How do you wear this?

866
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,240
This seems like...

867
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
This is like what Sun Wukong wore.

868
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,840
Sun Wukong's skirt-pants.

869
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,240
This is from when you were on the deserted island.

870
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,760
When you were living there.

871
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,200
You made this wildman's outfit, right?

872
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Yes.

873
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
You made these clothes for Baba Liu.

874
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,560
Then Baba Liu should wear them.

875
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,160
Baba (Liu).

876
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,960
Baba Liu.

877
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,520
Baba Liu.

878
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,600
You take this...

879
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,720
Loincloth.

880
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,320
What does it mean to put this on?

881
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,400
It really suits you.

882
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm kind of speechless.

883
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
We need to search carefully.

884
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
Wait, there's something inside.

885
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,640
What is it?

886
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
There's a piece of paper in here.

887
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,680
Really?

888
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,160
Look.

889
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,080
He has scissors here.

890
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,400
Where?

891
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,520
Here, move it aside.

892
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,280
Just cut straight across.

893
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
No, don't cut it like that.

894
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,520
Hello, Princess. What's wrong?

895
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,640
Today, I'm your butler.

896
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,840
If you have any orders, just—

897
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,680
At least stand next to me when you say it.

898
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,800
Okay. Hello, Princess.

899
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,600
Give it to me, I'll do it.

900
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:55,880
I...

901
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,800
Not strong enough. Can I cut it like this?

902
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,200
Here.

903
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,480
There's a piece of paper here.

904
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,560
You read it. Go ahead.

905
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,000
You read it, Baba Liu.

906
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,840
Baba Liu.

907
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,680
Xiao Ba.

908
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
I hope when you see these words,

909
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,600
you can forgive me for deceiving you.

910
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,400
Deceiving.

911
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,000
Two years ago,

912
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,280
I was abducted to this

913
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,280
small island called "Shenhun Dian Island."

914
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,560
They gave me a number.

915
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,360
C8745.

916
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
A number.

917
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,360
When I felt hopeless in life,

918
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,160
it was your number, the one who grew up on the island,

919
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,360
B8864, that gave me hope.

920
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,520
You have a number too.

921
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
Because your personality is both proud and kind,

922
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
I used my own surname

923
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,840
to give you the name Ba Jiaoshan.

924
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,120
We made a promise

925
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,840
to bravely move forward together.

926
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,040
But later, for some reason,

927
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
you suddenly lost your memory.

928
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,240
My head hit a reef.

929
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
That's why I lost my memory.

930
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
I took you to a cave

931
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,360
and hid you there.

932
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
I also discovered that they created the Fountain of Youth.

933
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,640
The Fountain of Youth was man-made.

934
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,040
The Fountain of Youth

935
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,800
He didn't stay young because of supplements.

936
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,160
He stayed young until then

937
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,520
because of the Fountain of Youth.

938
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,240
It can only maintain a youthful appearance on the surface.

939
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,280
Maintain.

940
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,400
So I stole a bottle

941
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,480
hoping to take it out

942
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,280
as evidence of their crime.

943
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,920
Evidence.

944
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,840
I couldn't tell you these things in person,

945
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,640
so I had to sew them into this dress.

946
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,000
I ask for your forgiveness.

947
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,160
Do you still remember any of this?

948
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Of course not.

949
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,800
I lose my memory every six months.

950
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,320
C8745

951
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
B8864

952
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,040
"Shenhun Dian Island"

953
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,760
Friends, I feel like

954
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,840
we are all people on this island.

955
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
This old man, Ren Weishan,

956
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,840
look, he also does beauty and medical treatments.

957
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,640
Hand out some business cards to them.

958
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,600
What blood types are you all?

959
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,120
We are all numbered test subjects.

960
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,560
C8745, B8864.

961
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,480
You have a number too.

962
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,000
To make these people immortal,

963
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,400
they extract things from our bodies.

964
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,120
So they can live forever.

965
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,400
The Fountain of Youth.

966
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,480
I also found out they created a Fountain of Youth.

967
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,320
Ba.

968
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,040
There's definitely a flaw in your logic.

969
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,640
Why?

970
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,520
They probably didn't extract anything from me.

971
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,560
Because I'm still this fat.

972
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
Everyone who got extracted from became thinner.

973
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,920
But they're not extracting fat.

974
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,000
I want the thing they took from her.

975
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,440
I want it injected into my body.

976
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,840
I want it.

977
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
Bring Ren Weishan back to life for me.

978
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,760
He's already dead.

979
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,400
It's too late.

980
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,640
Check for me.

981
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,640
Hurry, next step.

982
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Check for me, I must find out today.

983
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,800
Next,

984
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,520
go to Ning's room.

985
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,920
As for me, I'll go to the reception.

986
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
Because I didn't go back to my room to sleep last night.

987
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,400
I slept at the reception.

988
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,200
Alright, let's go.

989
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
Ning, reception.

990
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,200
Come on.

991
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,120
Start searching.

992
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
This is way too clean.

993
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,320
Check out that flower.

994
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,160
Come.

995
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,640
You didn't find it again.

996
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,480
It was just in the place you were looking.

997
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,600
I really...

998
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Name

999
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,600
Qi Ji

1000
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,680
Nuannuan

1001
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,240
Your wife

1002
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,160
This girl is called Qi Ji.

1003
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,240
A year after I married her,

1004
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,120
we had a child.

1005
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,320
I found out that she and our daughter had disappeared.

1006
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
ID number

1007
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,800
Date of birth

1008
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,720
February 15, 1980

1009
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,560
No previous medical history upon examination.

1010
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,200
No bad habits.

1011
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
Excellent genes, able to bear children.

1012
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,440
Has already given birth to two sons and one daughter for Ren Weishan.

1013
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,040
Discovered during escape.

1014
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,640
Handled, confirmed deceased.

1015
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,160
Goosebumps.

1016
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,360
So your motive for murder

1017
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,320
has already come out.

1018
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,840
Jin Shangbao

1019
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,400
There are two more pieces of paper where you just searched.

1020
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,480
Jin Shangbao

1021
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,840
That Ning family, just because Nuannuan is a girl,

1022
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,600
your parents abandoned her at the foundling tower.

1023
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,040
I can hardly believe it, in this day and age.

1024
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,920
In broad daylight,

1025
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,440
such blatant

1026
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,760
murder of girls can still happen.

1027
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,920
Your family is utterly heartless.

1028
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,480
I've already found my daughter.

1029
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
But from now on, we are completely severed.

1030
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,920
Never see me again.

1031
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,560
Who wrote this?

1032
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,720
Qi Ji

1033
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,840
Qi Ji's mother

1034
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,200
Qi Ji wrote it.

1035
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,000
Nuannuan is her daughter—that's me.

1036
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,000
You abandoned your daughter.

1037
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
Just because she was a girl,

1038
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,960
you left her at the foundling tower.

1039
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,400
And this, too.

1040
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,560
If you want to know your wife's whereabouts,

1041
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,120
go to Room 201.

1042
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,400
This must have been received last night.

1043
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,280
Here's what happened.

1044
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,360
After things ended at nine o'clock last night,

1045
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,280
I told Ba Jiaoshan

1046
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,400
that we hadn't seen each other in a long time.

1047
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,080
So I went back to the room with her.

1048
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,120
We had a good talk about our father-daughter relationship.

1049
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,320
We talked about how things have been these past few years.

1050
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Or maybe I shared a bit

1051
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,160
about how I've been these past few years.

1052
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,680
You abandoned her, yet you still have so much to say.

1053
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,200
Yes.

1054
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,880
That's right.

1055
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,520
Around 9:40,

1056
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,480
I left her room.

1057
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,440
I planned to tidy up a bit.

1058
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,000
We were going to have dinner together at 10:30.

1059
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,840
But at my room's door,

1060
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,680
there were these two letters.

1061
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,640
So, judging by the handwriting,

1062
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
I could tell it was from my wife, Qiji.

1063
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,600
The handwriting was hers.

1064
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,160
Back then,

1065
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,000
my parents told me that my wife, Qiji,

1066
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,120
couldn't stand life in the countryside.

1067
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,680
She thought life here was too hard.

1068
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
So she resolutely left with Nuannuan.

1069
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,120
But when I saw this letter,

1070
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,480
I finally learned the truth from back then.

1071
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,880
It was because my parents

1072
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,080
valued sons over daughters.

1073
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,160
Without my wife Qiji knowing,

1074
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,640
my parents

1075
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,840
abandoned you at the foundling tower.

1076
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,680
They intended to leave you to fend for yourself.

1077
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,000
My wife found out about this.

1078
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,400
She immediately ran to the abandoned baby tower.

1079
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,880
You can see she already wrote it in her letter.

1080
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,800
I just found our daughter.

1081
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
At that moment, she thought

1082
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,520
that I told my parents to abandon you.

1083
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,720
She thought I didn't want a daughter.

1084
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,200
Because my parents lied to both sides.

1085
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,760
Actually, it was all a misunderstanding.

1086
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,120
A misunderstanding.

1087
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Then I searched for my daughter

1088
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,160
and my wife for nineteen years.

1089
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,040
One day, I went out fishing.

1090
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,760
When I came back,

1091
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,200
I found that both mother and daughter

1092
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,040
had disappeared.

1093
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,800
So yesterday, when I saw this letter,

1094
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,560
I finally understood

1095
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,120
everything that happened back then.

1096
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,680
There was also a note

1097
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,240
saying if you want to know your wife's whereabouts,

1098
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,400
go to Room 201.

1099
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,280
That's Ren Weishan's room.

1100
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,880
So at 4:45,

1101
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,080
right after I left her room,

1102
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,640
five minutes later,

1103
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,720
I went to Room 201.

1104
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,600
Kill him immediately.

1105
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,480
Go find him immediately.

1106
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,840
Didn't take it out.

1107
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,120
Then when I went there,

1108
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,400
the door was ajar.

1109
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,200
The door was open.

1110
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,880
That means someone had already been there.

1111
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,720
When I went, there was no one there.

1112
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,000
So I found this.

1113
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,760
It's this piece of paper.

1114
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,160
I think it was at this moment

1115
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,160
when she was writing this farewell letter

1116
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,200
that she was suddenly taken away.

1117
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,520
Because in this place,

1118
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,360
I've already found my daughter.

1119
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,040
But from now on,

1120
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,440
we are completely finished, never to meet again.

1121
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,360
I will

1122
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
turn into a wave.

1123
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,480
It feels like she was suddenly

1124
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,680
just suddenly interrupted.

1125
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,680
I think after she was taken away,

1126
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,440
she was forced to be locked up somewhere.

1127
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,360
to have a child for Ren Weishan.

1128
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,760
But she wanted to escape from that place.

1129
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,960
But she ended up being killed.

1130
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,600
What about the kid?

1131
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,400
Was the kid killed too?

1132
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,240
No.

1133
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,800
No.

1134
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,120
No one knows about those two kids.

1135
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,400
Because I'm the receptionist here.

1136
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,000
So after you all left,

1137
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,240
I closed the door to the banquet hall.

1138
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,000
That was around midnight.

1139
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,680
There's a smart socket in the banquet hall.

1140
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,240
It needs me to use my phone

1141
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,320
and enter my personal account password

1142
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
to turn off that smart power strip.

1143
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,960
It only controls that room, right?

1144
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,080
Yes, it's just the banquet hall's smart socket.

1145
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,560
So, at midnight,

1146
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,000
I came back and stayed in the reception room.

1147
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,120
I was thinking of a foolproof plan.

1148
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,320
I wanted to kill him.

1149
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,360
Did you come up with one?

1150
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,920
As I was thinking,

1151
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,720
as I kept thinking,

1152
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,800
and thinking,

1153
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,560
I fell asleep.

1154
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,200
Okay.

1155
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,440
Okay.

1156
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,760
Okay.

1157
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,600
Toolbox.

1158
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
There are a lot of things in his toolbox.

1159
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,680
There are many things inside the toolbox.

1160
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,720
Walkie-talkie.

1161
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,280
UV flashlight.

1162
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,720
Scan these items of his, see if there’s anything.

1163
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,520
Right.

1164
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:10,800
That's correct.

1165
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,040
This

1166
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,160
What is this?

1167
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,320
What kind of green fish is that?

1168
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,240
There's one here too.

1169
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,920
Who is this?

1170
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,320
Fluorescent

1171
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,120
The person wearing the cape

1172
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,120
Yeah

1173
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,440
The fluorescent guy is giving you a hint.

1174
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,120
The fluorescent guy is helping us.

1175
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,280
The fluorescent guy is making everything happen.

1176
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,200
Alright, let's go to the next room.

1177
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,360
Gold

1178
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,200
Next

1179
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,320
Okay, let's go.

1180
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,880
Go

1181
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,080
Go

1182
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,520
Come on

1183
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,920
Start

1184
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,400
Start

1185
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:20,840
Start

1186
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,080
You look so greedy.

1187
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,880
You're obsessed with money, aren't you?

1188
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,160
No, I'm looking for clues.

1189
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,240
I didn't take her money.

1190
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,360
Found it.

1191
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,200
Your family's genes are really strong.

1192
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Six people

1193
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,480
All share the same face.

1194
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,560
Yeah

1195
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
When children are born in our family

1196
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,400
they all have my face.

1197
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,360
What about this?

1198
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,920
What is this?

1199
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,640
This is a symbol of our family.

1200
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
What family are you from?

1201
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,200
Are you a noble or something?

1202
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,320
Mermaid

1203
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,840
Is there anything behind that?

1204
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,200
Take it.

1205
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,920
Open it yourself.

1206
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,440
This box can't be opened.

1207
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,680
There's something here.

1208
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,280
Top secret of the Tuixian Group.

1209
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,720
"Shenhundian Island" Development Plan.

1210
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Eliminate native residents deemed worthless.

1211
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,160
Those with disabilities or illnesses.

1212
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,440
People over sixty and similar groups.

1213
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,920
All to be executed by being thrown into the sea.

1214
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,080
Strict imprisonment and control.

1215
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,840
Young and healthy adults.

1216
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,080
This plan must be kept strictly confidential at the top level.

1217
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Advance the development plan in secret.

1218
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,280
Ren Weishan, April 2000.

1219
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,680
Jin Shangbao.

1220
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,440
This island is "Shenhundian Island."

1221
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,160
It's the island you stayed on.

1222
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,760
This was once a paradise.

1223
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,240
Everyone lived in harmony.

1224
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,640
Just like it's described in "Peach Blossom Spring."

1225
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,280
But I can't recite it anymore.

1226
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,400
It was truly wonderful.

1227
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,440
Until one day,

1228
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,080
A man named Ren Weishan

1229
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,600
developed this island.

1230
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,840
He invaded us.

1231
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
He took all our islanders

1232
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,400
and captured and imprisoned them.

1233
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,200
The old, weak, sick, and disabled were thrown into the sea.

1234
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,680
The young were imprisoned.

1235
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,040
He destroyed this place.

1236
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,000
This is what I discovered.

1237
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,040
Here's what happened.

1238
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,160
My whole family

1239
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,800
used to live on that island.

1240
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,920
We are all descendants of Tui Sanniang and her followers.

1241
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,760
Then Ren Weishan

1242
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,160
heard there was treasure on our island

1243
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,840
and came to invade us.

1244
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,120
He imprisoned us all together.

1245
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,920
Yesterday, didn't you ask me

1246
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,280
why my sister disappeared?

1247
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,360
My parents passed away soon after.

1248
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,880
My parents were already in poor health.

1249
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,480
My sister's disappearance

1250
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,360
was a huge blow to them.

1251
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,400
Back then,

1252
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,840
when he led us in our escape,

1253
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,120
my sister went missing.

1254
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,600
It devastated them.

1255
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,880
My father died first.

1256
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,120
Then my mother held on for a while

1257
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,800
and on her deathbed,

1258
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,440
she told me

1259
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,760
about my true identity and this box.

1260
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,560
She brought it from "Shenhun Dian Island" back then.

1261
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,200
She took it with her when she left.

1262
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,560
It holds secrets about our island

1263
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,680
and our family's origins.

1264
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,120
But the password can't be unlocked.

1265
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,360
Then what's your relationship with Ren Weishan?

1266
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,880
Don't you have that symbol?

1267
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,200
The pirate pattern on the back of the photo.

1268
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,600
My mom had a ring.

1269
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,480
It had this pattern.

1270
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,480
My mom told me that during the big fire back then,

1271
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,360
the person who caused the deaths on our island,

1272
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,320
when she escaped,

1273
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,680
my mom used her own ring

1274
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,800
heated it in the fire

1275
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,840
and pressed this pattern

1276
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,240
onto that person's hand.

1277
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,200
Yesterday, there was one.

1278
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,720
Which room are we staying in?

1279
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,080
This mark is exactly what my mom told me about.

1280
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,280
It's the killer's mark.

1281
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,120
My sister died in the sea.

1282
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,760
Both my parents died.

1283
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,240
That's how I became someone with no close family.

1284
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,200
Before my mom died, she told me

1285
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,640
I must take revenge.

1286
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,040
So,

1287
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,840
you killed him.

1288
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,680
Of course.

1289
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,160
At that moment, the urge to kill arose.

1290
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,800
That's why I wanted to go to his room.

1291
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,320
Just to investigate.

1292
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,240
At 21:25,

1293
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,320
I arrived at his room.

1294
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,440
I found that he wasn't in the room.

1295
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,600
And it wasn't locked.

1296
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,840
Then I couldn't find him.

1297
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,440
I couldn't kill him.

1298
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,760
So I found that piece of paper.

1299
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,160
Then let's hurry to the next place.

1300
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,760
Mine.

1301
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,560
Go upstairs.

1302
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,320
Let's go.

1303
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,400
So beautiful.

1304
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,240
A butterfly.

1305
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,400
What is this?

1306
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,720
It's so beautiful.

1307
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,920
Yeah, he likes bugs.

1308
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,640
Before we start collecting evidence,

1309
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,680
why don't you explain yourself first?

1310
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,840
Treat.

1311
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,000
That's how I was treated.

1312
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,960
Here's a file folder.

1313
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,560
This is from Tuishi Agriculture.

1314
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,080
This is Tuishi (Agriculture).

1315
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,320
Letting you play.

1316
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,400
Letting you play.

1317
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,080
That scared me.

1318
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,600
I was just about to read "Tuishi Agriculture."

1319
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,440
He Chongchong said,

1320
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,960
Approved.

1321
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,760
You have been

1322
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,080
admitted to our university's Biological Sciences, Entomology major.

1323
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,200
Please come here to register.

1324
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,960
Agricultural University.

1325
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,560
He Chongchong.

1326
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,400
Gender: Male.

1327
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,200
Age: Sixteen.

1328
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Height: 1.60 meters.

1329
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,120
You were 1.60 meters tall at sixteen?

1330
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:09,760
Search again.

1331
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,040
This...

1332
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,200
This...

1333
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,320
Say, what's wrong?

1334
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,560
You tell me, what's wrong?

1335
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,120
How come you draw just like him?

1336
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,160
Isn't this Baihua's drawing?

1337
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,720
You two...

1338
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,040
Brothers.

1339
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,440
No.

1340
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,200
It's just where we live.

1341
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,520
"Shenhundian Island"

1342
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,040
You’re all from the same hometown, all of you.

1343
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,680
Right.

1344
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,280
Then...

1345
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,760
Who’s this?

1346
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,720
This is on "Shenhundian Island".

1347
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,520
He’s the steward in charge of my area.

1348
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Steward?

1349
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,680
Yes.

1350
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,200
Why did you take a photo with the steward?

1351
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,560
This is fake.

1352
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,440
There’s so much stuff.

1353
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,520
If the lighthouse hasn’t arrived yet,

1354
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,840
even an isolated island can reach the mountains and seas.

1355
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,360
Be brave and pursue the meaning of life.

1356
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,240
Your future depends on yourself.

1357
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,160
Don’t hesitate, don’t wander, don’t look back.

1358
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,400
Who wrote this for you?

1359
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,280
My steward.

1360
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
What’s your relationship with your steward?

1361
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,360
Something feels off to me.

1362
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,600
There’s a piece of paper here.

1363
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,800
Inside the pet box.

1364
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,800
There’s a piece of paper here.

1365
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,040
This is so "stupid".

1366
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,480
They thought we’d actually be scared of this thing.

1367
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,840
I’m actually scared.

1368
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,080
It doesn’t even move.

1369
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,680
Test Report

1370
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,160
Sample Name: Fluorescent Powder

1371
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,560
Sample intact, no abnormalities

1372
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,320
Upon inspection

1373
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,640
Fluorescent powder is a type of

1374
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,440
substance shed from failed test subjects

1375
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,640
that has flaked off

1376
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,640
It originates from

1377
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,360
abnormal deposition of stem cell marker reagents during experiments

1378
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,600
The reagent degrades

1379
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,600
and turns into a fluorescent powder

1380
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,920
which eventually adheres to the test subject

1381
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,800
If the human body is exposed for a long time

1382
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,120
it may cause unknown side effects

1383
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,120
The fluorescent man is also a test subject

1384
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,640
wearing luminous clothing

1385
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,920
Fluorescent powder is a type of

1386
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,760
substance shed from failed test subjects

1387
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,960
that has flaked off

1388
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,840
There's something else

1389
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,320
So romantic

1390
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,880
You can do this for your girlfriend in the future

1391
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,920
I'm a romantic person

1392
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,920
Any clues?

1393
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,560
There's also a phone

1394
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,960
A cell phone

1395
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,000
I have to say

1396
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,240
This photo makes me look handsome again

1397
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:29,840
Okay

1398
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,880
Again and again

1399
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,800
I'm impressed by your looks again

1400
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,800
D-Class Roster

1401
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,320
Ren Weishan Parent-Child Database

1402
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,480
D1 Female

1403
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,160
Year 2000

1404
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,280
Extracted once per year

1405
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,480
Extraction quality poor, deceased

1406
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,440
The rest are the same

1407
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,080
But D6 Male

1408
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,560
Born in 2003

1409
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,440
Extracted once per year

1410
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,600
Extraction quality good

1411
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,480
With the help of the butler Niu Da

1412
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,720
Escaped in August 2019

1413
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,320
Whereabouts unknown

1414
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,440
Niu Da was punished as a result

1415
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,240
Later disappeared

1416
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,400
Must be found and executed as soon as possible

1417
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,560
There is also a birth record

1418
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,280
Newborn name: D6

1419
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,040
Gender: Male

1420
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,400
Father's name

1421
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,640
It says Ren Weishan, then it's crossed out

1422
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,120
Changed to Niu Da

1423
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,480
Is Niu Da his administrator?

1424
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,000
Yes

1425
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,080
So you are Niu Da's son, D6

1426
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,520
Niu Da

1427
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,720
My father is still Ren Weishan

1428
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,400
Six years ago

1429
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,640
My butler suddenly handed me a

1430
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,040
That information sheet just now

1431
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,360
He told me to live according to this identity

1432
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,480
To live

1433
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,960
Replacing someone else

1434
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,920
I took his identity

1435
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,720
Came to Tui City University

1436
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,040
Studied in the Department of Entomology

1437
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,680
I am D6

1438
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,280
D6

1439
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,720
My name is Xiao Niu

1440
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,760
D6 Calf

1441
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,000
After graduation

1442
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,560
I wanted to go back to that island

1443
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,160
but I couldn't find that island anymore

1444
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,680
You can't go back

1445
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,320
Can't go back

1446
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,720
With no other choice, I found a job

1447
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,320
at a travel agency

1448
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,400
Because of work

1449
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,160
I went to a place called "La Island"

1450
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,120
And on "La Island"

1451
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,600
I discovered

1452
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,200
an insect exactly like that specimen

1453
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,800
It made me think

1454
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,520
maybe my butler is here too

1455
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,640
So I chased this longhorn beetle on the island

1456
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,800
hoping to find some clues

1457
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,520
But I fainted while chasing it

1458
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,680
You're so useless

1459
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,800
While I was unconscious

1460
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,680
when I woke up

1461
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,360
I was in one of the island's

1462
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,600
houses when I woke up

1463
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,480
When I came out of the house, I saw

1464
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,280
a glowing person

1465
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,640
That figure looked just like my butler from behind

1466
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,760
So I ran after them

1467
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
but I couldn't catch up

1468
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,120
When I returned to the cabin

1469
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,800
I found my things had been organized

1470
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,240
The way they were arranged

1471
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,080
was exactly the same as when my butler

1472
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,920
used to take care of me when I was a child

1473
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,120
That proved the glowing person

1474
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,960
must be my butler

1475
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,080
Then I took his fluorescent powder

1476
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,560
and came back to test it, and discovered

1477
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,000
my butler had been turned into

1478
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,520
a failed experiment subject.

1479
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,640
So when you saw him yesterday

1480
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,760
did you feel

1481
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,720
he looked somewhat like your butler?

1482
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,760
It was him. I'm sure he was the butler.

1483
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,560
Then I thought about it

1484
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,040
Ren Weishan and the butler were in the same place

1485
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,920
Could Ren Weishan have had

1486
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,840
bad intentions toward the butler?

1487
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,600
So

1488
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,360
last night

1489
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,080
at 9:15

1490
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,640
I went to Ren Weishan's room to investigate

1491
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,200
what exactly he wanted to do to the butler.

1492
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,840
Then at 9:20

1493
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,720
I left and returned to my own room.

1494
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,520
I thought something was wrong.

1495
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,400
I wanted to check

1496
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,880
if Niu Da was in the courtyard.

1497
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,960
I went out to look in the courtyard.

1498
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,000
So far, you are the only one

1499
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,160
who has gone out of the courtyard to look for someone.

1500
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,440
Yes.

1501
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,320
I did go out of the courtyard.

1502
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,440
But I didn't see anything.

1503
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,360
Then I went back to my room.

1504
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,600
At 10:30, we went to have a late-night snack.

1505
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:21,840
We ate.

1506
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,240
Had a late-night snack.

1507
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,680
Yes.

1508
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,360
Then I went back to sleep.

1509
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,320
I fell asleep while thinking.

1510
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,040
My blood sugar was too high.

1511
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,680
How can you still sleep at a time like this?

1512
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,640
Alright, let's go.

1513
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,120
Who's next?

1514
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:36,840
Go to Ke Wuwang.

1515
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,400
Last one.

1516
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:42,680
Wait a second.

1517
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,160
Hold on.

1518
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,280
You have to take off your shoes in my room.

1519
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
Why?

1520
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,040
Acupressure mat.

1521
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,000
I'm speechless.

1522
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,200
Then we don't have to search.

1523
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,840
Forget it, let's not search.

1524
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,080
Because this is where I usually practice dancing.

1525
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,680
It's a special carpet material.

1526
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,680
So that no one

1527
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,800
ruins the ecosystem of my room,

1528
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,440
you must take off your shoes before entering.

1529
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,320
Don't be afraid.

1530
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,200
Really, it's nothing.

1531
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,040
I'm even wearing thermal underwear.

1532
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:21,840
Who isn't wearing thermal underwear?

1533
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:22,760
Look at mine.

1534
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,520
It hurts.

1535
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,360
It hurts.

1536
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,920
It hurts.

1537
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,720
It hurts so much.

1538
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,920
Dr. He, you go first.

1539
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,120
This...

1540
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,680
This tests a person's body.

1541
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,240
If a man stands on it,

1542
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,400
and feels a lot of pain,

1543
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,200
it means he's kind of like the "wave pusher" type.

1544
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,280
Don't end up being the one who suffers the most.

1545
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,040
Like pushing the waves forward.

1546
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,760
Maybe his kidneys are already failing or something.

1547
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,360
It doesn't hurt.

1548
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,480
Of course it doesn't hurt.

1549
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,880
It doesn't hurt at all. Where does it hurt?

1550
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,640
Does it hurt? Are you in pain?

1551
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,800
Men who always want to be strong.

1552
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,800
It's actually okay.

1553
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,640
Really, it's actually fine.

1554
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,840
Stop pretending.

1555
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,960
I don't feel anything at all.

1556
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,680
Stop pretending.

1557
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,720
I don't feel anything at all.

1558
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,920
A man who always wants to be strong.

1559
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,760
It's not bad.

1560
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,400
Ba.

1561
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,560
Maybe it's not that you're healthy.

1562
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,280
Maybe you just have thick skin on your feet.

1563
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,840
The most important thing.

1564
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,080
Wait, what's this thing?

1565
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:19,880
Okay.

1566
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,200
The most important thing.

1567
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,560
You two

1568
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,920
Does it have to jump that high?

1569
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,400
Good thing my face wasn't here.

1570
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,600
What are you two up to?

1571
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:47,800
Ah!

1572
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:49,800
Okay, hurry up.

1573
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,080
What is "sniping butterflies"?

1574
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,200
We'll listen to you from the bed.

1575
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,200
Okay.

1576
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,320
I want to get on too.

1577
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,560
Come on, please stand.

1578
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:21,560
Confess.

1579
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,320
Speak.

1580
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,040
No need to say it, I know.

1581
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,960
My father

1582
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:29,960
is

1583
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:30,920
Ke

1584
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,280
Professor

1585
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,600
Professor Ke

1586
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,560
Ke has smelly feet

1587
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,840
so he takes off his shoes here every day.

1588
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,680
Okay.

1589
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,800
My father is a top expert in biology.

1590
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,320
He has spent his whole life researching

1591
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,680
something called pluripotent stem cells.

1592
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,880
These cells can make people live forever

1593
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,480
and never age.

1594
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,000
In 2018, when I was sixteen,

1595
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,480
my father

1596
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,520
suddenly received an invitation

1597
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,400
to go to an island

1598
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,760
as the island's chief scientist

1599
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,760
to lead their research on this subject.

1600
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,680
My father was very interested.

1601
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,560
He wanted to go

1602
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,200
to fulfill his research dream.

1603
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,720
I told him,

1604
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,279
"Father, I don't want to be separated from you."

1605
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,279
My father couldn't bear

1606
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,560
to leave me here alone.

1607
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,600
So he said, "Alright,"

1608
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,439
"I'll take you with me."

1609
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,560
He brought me—

1610
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,040
No, your father entrusted you to me.

1611
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,359
Shut up.

1612
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:28,920
Shut up.

1613
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,040
How old are you anyway?

1614
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,120
I was the one who raised you.

1615
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,160
You should know your own situation.

1616
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,200
You lose your memory every six months.

1617
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,359
Who could you possibly take care of?

1618
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,760
He secretly

1619
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,560
brought me to this island.

1620
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,720
Until one day,

1621
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,240
a little girl appeared.

1622
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
This little girl

1623
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,920
handed me a crumpled gift.

1624
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,560
It was wrapped in the paper you're holding.

1625
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,560
A gift wrapped in that paper.

1626
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,840
She told me someone was after her.

1627
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,279
Someone was looking for her.

1628
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,840
My dad's heart softened again,

1629
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,000
so he took her in as well.

1630
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,600
Later, while doing research,

1631
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,000
suddenly one day,

1632
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,040
my dad told me

1633
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,040
that this island was no longer safe.

1634
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,439
He said you have to leave now.

1635
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:22,080
Because he told me

1636
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,600
that there are actually some

1637
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,200
illegal experiments happening on this island.

1638
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,040
Before I left,

1639
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,560
he gave me this.

1640
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,359
This is the most important thing.

1641
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:36,840
A bracelet.

1642
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,479
That's right.

1643
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,439
He said this was left by Mom.

1644
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,800
Actually, there are two inside.

1645
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,680
But he only gave me one of the bracelets.

1646
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,640
Half of it.

1647
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,080
He said he hopes this half of the butterfly

1648
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,359
can, in the future,

1649
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:48,040
when you go back to your own life,

1650
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,120
bring you good luck.

1651
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,760
And this one? Is this also yours?

1652
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,200
This is mine too, that's right.

1653
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,360
You open it.

1654
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,080
The password is my birthday.

1655
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,040
I know your birthday, I—

1656
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,920
This move is just

1657
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,200
cutting off the source, this move is—

1658
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,840
I'm really very sad.

1659
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,320
So upset.

1660
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,120
You really saw him as an older brother.

1661
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,520
Because I can totally see

1662
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,760
that you truly treated him as your big brother.

1663
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,160
I didn't expect he would be

1664
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,520
such an unreliable person.

1665
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,880
He's a "hollow man."

1666
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,480
Yeah.

1667
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,080
I'm not a "hollow man."

1668
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,320
I'm a "heartless man."

1669
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
I saw it coming long ago.

1670
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,760
He's a "heartless guy."

1671
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,640
to

1672
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,080
opened

1673
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,840
Here, let me read his diary.

1674
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,520
December 20, 2019

1675
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,080
Ren Weishan, chairman of Tuixian

1676
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,960
He lives up to his name—hypocritical.

1677
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,440
He used me to develop a stem cell reagent.

1678
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,600
He even went so far as to

1679
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,440
illegally conduct human experiments in secret.

1680
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,640
This island must be "Shenhun Dian Island."

1681
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,680
Yes.

1682
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,800
Yes.

1683
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,600
Yes.

1684
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,840
All the evidence of Ren Weishan's crimes

1685
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,080
is well hidden by him.

1686
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,880
I must find a way to locate that evidence.

1687
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,720
and report him.

1688
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,640
But the island's signal

1689
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,520
is controlled by Ren Weishan.

1690
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,440
December 22

1691
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,200
I thought of a way to contact the outside world.

1692
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,160
But not long after I sent the report email,

1693
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,360
Ren Weishan found out.

1694
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,280
Not only that,

1695
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,480
he even forced poison down my throat.

1696
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,840
The boat to send Xiao Jin away

1697
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,320
has already been arranged.

1698
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,880
So Xiao Jin

1699
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,760
You two are...

1700
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,120
It's the gift she gave him.

1701
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,520
No.

1702
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,400
The person who gave me this gift

1703
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,720
is actually named Jin Saozhou.

1704
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,840
Sister.

1705
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,000
My sister disappeared.

1706
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,680
A little girl showed up.

1707
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,520
She told me someone was trying to kill her.

1708
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,080
Someone was looking for her.

1709
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,520
My dad's heart softened again,

1710
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,120
so he took her in as well.

1711
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,960
The boat to send Xiao Jin away

1712
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,800
has already been arranged.

1713
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,160
It's the little girl your parents adopted.

1714
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:50,880
That's Jin Saozhou, right?

1715
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,240
Yes.

1716
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,520
My sister is gone.

1717
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,760
So let me take her place

1718
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:54,960
and love you.

1719
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:55,880
Love.

1720
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,440
So what is "Sniper Butterfly"?

1721
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,840
After I left the island,

1722
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,520
because my dad told me,

1723
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,040
that this organization knows about your existence.

1724
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,080
So after you escaped,

1725
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,000
they would definitely send people to the city to look for you.

1726
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,200
So after I got off the island, I went

1727
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:14,920
and opened a nightclub.

1728
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,640
I became the nightclub owner I am now.

1729
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Your dad was imprisoned on the island,

1730
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,040
and you went out clubbing.

1731
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,160
Because I thought

1732
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,120
the best way to avoid being hunted down

1733
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,600
was to blend in with the crowd.

1734
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,320
Keep the music playing and keep dancing.

1735
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,440
That's right.

1736
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,000
Life has to go on.

1737
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,160
Such an optimistic boy.

1738
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,280
After I opened this nightclub,

1739
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,040
I

1740
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,560
as expected,

1741
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,800
I lived comfortably on my own for many years.

1742
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,320
No one found me, indeed.

1743
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,760
But I still wanted to find my father.

1744
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,480
So I started thinking

1745
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,240
about how I could find that island again.

1746
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:55,840
I thought,

1747
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,080
the only clue I brought

1748
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,880
from the island back then

1749
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,640
was this butterfly I wear on my hand.

1750
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,120
So I issued

1751
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
a "Sniper Butterfly" bounty.

1752
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,160
I hoped that every guest

1753
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,320
who came to my nightclub

1754
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,640
could tell me

1755
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,920
anything about this bracelet,

1756
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,400
any clue at all,

1757
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,840
and they would get some

1758
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,800
free gifts from my club.

1759
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,120
Until one day,

1760
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,040
I received an invitation.

1761
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,160
It was for us to come here.

1762
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,800
It said this place could take us

1763
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,400
to see the treasure island of Lady Tui San.

1764
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,400
I thought maybe this island

1765
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,920
—since it's an island anyway—

1766
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,600
might have some clues.

1767
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,440
So I came.

1768
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,720
What a coincidence.

1769
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,080
Because I had no other leads.

1770
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,080
Do you and that Ren Weishan

1771
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,440
have any connection at all?

1772
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,520
When I saw him last night,

1773
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,160
on his left hand

1774
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:45,880
on his arm

1775
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,360
there was a mark.

1776
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,280
I remembered

1777
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,240
when I was a child on the island,

1778
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,040
staying there with my father,

1779
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,440
I saw the staff on the island

1780
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,320
with this same thing on their hands.

1781
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,320
So I knew

1782
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,080
this person must be

1783
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,400
one of the people from the island back then.

1784
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,400
So that night,

1785
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,320
after we finished investigating that case,

1786
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,440
I went to his study at 9:55.

1787
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,240
Then I returned to my room at 10:00.

1788
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,280
He wasn't in the room, right?

1789
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:07,760
He wasn't in the room.

1790
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,880
What did you see when you entered his room?

1791
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,080
Just that locked notebook.

1792
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,440
Okay, your father's diary.

1793
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:11,760
That's right.

1794
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,480
After I came back,

1795
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,200
I used my birthday to unlock the notebook.

1796
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,040
I saw what my father wrote back then

1797
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,400
about everything he went through.

1798
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,920
I finally understood

1799
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,320
what really happened to my father at that time.

1800
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:20,920
Now,

1801
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,840
my anxious heart can finally rest.

1802
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,480
Because my father was already killed.

1803
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,040
So

1804
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,840
I knew it was Ren Weishan

1805
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,600
who killed my father.

1806
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,480
So he has a strong motive.

1807
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,600
To avenge his father.

1808
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,200
Anyway, after I got back to my room,

1809
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,400
I kept thinking about how he killed.

1810
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,120
As I was thinking about it,

1811
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,000
I fell asleep.

1812
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,840
I fell asleep.

1813
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,560
Alright.

1814
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,360
Truly a group of heartless people.

1815
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,440
"Hollow people."

1816
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:43,920
Alright.

1817
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:47,720
Next,

1818
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,720
let's go to the lounge and discuss.

1819
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,120
Okay.

1820
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,560
Everyone, come quickly, there's food.

1821
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,040
There's food.

1822
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,720
That's great.

1823
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,720
There are also steamed buns.

1824
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,280
I love steamed buns the most, thank you.

1825
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,520
You love eating my steamed buns the most.

1826
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,440
Anyway, everyone has a motive now.

1827
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,160
Yes.

1828
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,200
And they're all very strong today.

1829
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:20,800
That's right.

1830
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,400
Ren Weishan.

1831
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,600
He rounded up all of us islanders

1832
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,160
and locked us up.

1833
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,080
The old, weak, sick, and disabled were thrown into the sea.

1834
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,280
The young were imprisoned.

1835
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,040
Before my mother died, she told me

1836
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,400
I must take revenge.

1837
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,640
Your wife

1838
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,520
has given birth to two sons and a daughter for Ren Weishan.

1839
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,240
She was discovered while trying to escape.

1840
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,840
She has been dealt with and confirmed dead.

1841
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,320
I am D6

1842
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,320
Extraction is done once a year

1843
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,480
The extraction quality is good

1844
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,360
Thanks to the assistance of the butler Niu Da

1845
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,600
Escaped in August 2019

1846
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,200
Whereabouts unknown

1847
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,840
Must be found and executed as soon as possible

1848
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,720
My father received an invitation

1849
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,240
Inviting him to an island

1850
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,880
As the chief scientist

1851
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,880
One day my dad told me

1852
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,440
Illegal experiments were being conducted on the island

1853
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,560
December 22nd

1854
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,320
He forcibly made me drink poison

1855
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,520
It was this Ren Weishan who killed my dad

1856
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,400
As soon as he entered the room, his walkie-talkie went off

1857
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,600
Saying, "Boss, boss"

1858
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,040
I'm in Bai's room

1859
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,760
Should we get rid of him?

1860
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,400
I thought about going back and forth between rooms

1861
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,680
To block this Ling Lingfa

1862
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,280
He ran away

1863
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,080
Then I watched him

1864
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,360
The records on this phone

1865
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,760
Baizhihua seemed to remember something again

1866
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,320
I must kill him

1867
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,400
To eliminate future trouble

1868
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,320
I just felt

1869
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,200
Maybe I should

1870
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,480
Also try to kill him in return

1871
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,040
I think part of it is for her

1872
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,240
He actually knew since he was a child

1873
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,440
What was happening on that island

1874
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,320
He actually knew since he was a child

1875
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,560
What was happening on that island

1876
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,800
That's why he made up a story

1877
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,920
A wonderful thing

1878
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,640
was tricking you into rescuing me from that island.

1879
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,520
Xiao Ba,

1880
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,680
I hope when you read these words,

1881
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,520
you can forgive me for deceiving you.

1882
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,680
But he has a

1883
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,120
He has a chronic condition—amnesia.

1884
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:20,600
Yes.

1885
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,920
Yes, he’s known since he was a child.

1886
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,360
But his amnesia is episodic.

1887
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,280
That means he has flashbacks of certain moments.

1888
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,040
He paints pictures inspired by those flashes.

1889
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,600
They connect together.

1890
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,440
It’s overwhelming.

1891
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,320
But I’m not sure

1892
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,560
if that murderous intent

1893
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,800
arises during those flashbacks.

1894
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,840
I think we’ll definitely run into

1895
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,200
that fluorescent guy again soon.

1896
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,240
I think when Glowing Guy shows up

1897
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,160
his relationship with him might become clearer

1898
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:41,840
maybe something will come out of it

1899
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,240
Also, yesterday

1900
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,800
I saw two Glowing Guys

1901
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,720
I saw someone in a cloak at the restaurant

1902
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,960
but we only saw one

1903
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,200
But on the way back yesterday

1904
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:58,840
I saw two

1905
01:17:59,320 --> 01:17:59,800
so it's very possible

1906
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,600
a lot of things were done by the Glowing Person

1907
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,560
One thing is already confirmed

1908
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,040
The letter from my wife was given to me by the Glowing Person

1909
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:06,960
Light

1910
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,760
That person wearing the cloak

1911
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,880
So there are two people who have been experimented on

1912
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,480
Right

1913
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,080
Who else was harmed by Ren Weishan?

1914
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,000
Him, your dad

1915
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,320
Your dad

1916
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,480
It can't be my dad

1917
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,160
The Glowing Person

1918
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:24,800
No, that's impossible

1919
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,640
My dad is already dead

1920
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,480
Then who is the other one?

1921
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,200
And there's another suspicious point.

1922
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,200
Why did two people see

1923
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,200
Ren Weishan leave early?

1924
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,200
Why did three people see Ren Weishan

1925
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,760
stay until the end?

1926
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,160
He went home.

1927
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,680
We ate for another forty minutes.

1928
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,360
Then we left.

1929
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,400
But when we looked back, the boss was still there.

1930
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,200
Where was he?

1931
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,560
Still sitting there eating.

1932
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,160
That's right.

1933
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,520
Mine and his are exactly the same.

1934
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,840
Mine is exactly the same as his too.

1935
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,160
I saw that he was gone.

1936
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,200
I also saw he was gone.

1937
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,720
There's a difference—when did he leave?

1938
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,680
Including that person from yesterday.

1939
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,080
There was actually a computer on his table.

1940
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,680
We haven't had a chance to check it yet.

1941
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,920
It's in 201.

1942
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,280
Let's go take a look later.

1943
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,440
Is there any other evidence?

1944
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,240
Okay.

1945
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,640
Next, we'll move on to the X confirmation phase.

1946
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,920
In a moment, we'll switch from white to black.

1947
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,840
Let me speak first.

1948
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,640
There are five suspects now.

1949
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,200
If this person gets picked again,

1950
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,560
then they're really too weak.

1951
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,240
He picked me as X.

1952
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,320
He definitely had to pick.

1953
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,320
How could someone be this weak?

1954
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,000
She's talking about you.

1955
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,600
She means you.

1956
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,560
No, I'm just watching.

1957
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,280
Don't interrupt, I'm watching everyone.

1958
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,920
Who is going to be the culprit today?

1959
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,080
Really too weak.

1960
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,840
Don't pick me.

1961
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,560
Take a break.

1962
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,440
Everyone, find a place to rest.

1963
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:12,880
Okay.

1964
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,960
Break's over.

1965
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,880
Look at her.

1966
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,760
Ba.

1967
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,840
Why do you seem like you want to say something but stop?

1968
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,480
It's too obvious.

1969
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,200
I feel like she wanted to come in and scold someone,

1970
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,680
like, "Killer, I really look down on you."

1971
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,440
But then she thought, if she said that herself...

1972
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:41,800
No.

1973
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,920
Now I think

1974
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,680
he's very confident.

1975
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,840
What do you mean?

1976
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,280
No one picked her as X.

1977
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,040
Right, she means she's not X.

1978
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,640
But we don't know if that's true.

1979
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,320
It's also possible she's really bold now.

1980
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,840
Now she's starting to play these games with us.

1981
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,000
She wanted to say it as soon as she came in.

1982
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,680
I think no one picked her as X.

1983
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,440
No one picked you as X.

1984
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:30,880
Right.

1985
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,680
Let's go search the second area.

1986
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,200
Yeah, hurry.

1987
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:32,920
Let's talk as we walk.

1988
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,400
But there's a problem.

1989
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,280
But there's a problem.

1990
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,720
Go ahead.

1991
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,160
I'm X.

1992
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,800
I'm X.

1993
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,400
So who among you is the killer?

1994
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,000
Because each of you contacted me.

1995
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,000
Who among you is the real culprit?

1996
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,480
Each of you contacted me.

1997
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,400
I think I'm the culprit.

1998
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,640
You must also think you're the culprit.

1999
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,480
I also think I'm the culprit.

2000
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,440
This is the most chaotic ever.

2001
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,760
Is there anyone who acts as X like this?

2002
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,480
Ren Weishan's time of death can be determined.

2003
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,480
Between eleven and before twelve.

2004
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,080
Wait a moment.

2005
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,400
If this is the time of death,

2006
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,960
then none of us are suspects.

2007
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,640
That means our timeline is off.

2008
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,600
It definitely can't be like this.

2009
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,200
How is that possible?

2010
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,040
The time we spent here

2011
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,960
might not be the actual time.

2012
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:37,840
Wait a second.

2013
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,200
I'm sure I'm not hallucinating.

2014
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,640
I'm also sure it's not a hallucination.

2015
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,000
If this time is real,

2016
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,800
he died at this time.

2017
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,640
So we are the ones who killed him.

2018
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,280
Either it's the dead Ren Weishan,

2019
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,760
or it's not Ren Weishan.

2020
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,240
You two are confusing everyone.

2021
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:52,960
This is your wife.

2022
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,240
A is the black market.

2023
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:54,840
Abduction.

2024
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,080
A woman's genes obtained through unconventional means.

2025
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,480
He's actually alive.

2026
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,840
Why not just come in directly?

2027
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:00,720
The year 1980.

2028
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,240
She must have a reason she can't do it.

2029
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,400
Had many children.

2030
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,600
For reproduction.

2031
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,360
To establish a personal exclusive gene bank.

2032
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,160
Your dad is human.

2033
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,680
Is your dad human?

2034
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,680
The small garden in front of the door.

2035
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,800
I hit with a flowerpot.

2036
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,840
Under the tree in the garden.

2037
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,880
A sneak attack.

2038
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,600
I was in the hallway.

2039
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,480
I used something heavy.

2040
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,440
I was in his room, arranging ornaments.

2041
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,520
No, how could his body move?

2042
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,240
The killer murdered him right in front of us.

2043
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,680
Each of you had a different time.

2044
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,120
Everyone saw the lightning.

2045
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,360
