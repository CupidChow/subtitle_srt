1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,480
That smells amazing!

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,760
You always make hot pot for us—so thoughtful!

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Thanks!

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,000
Thanks, this was definitely worth it.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,360
Can we eat now?

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,720
Yeah, we can eat now. Everything's ready.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Smells amazing!

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,760
What soup do you have over there? How come you still have soup?

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,840
Same as you, chicken soup.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,360
You still have chicken soup over there?

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,280
Did you order that?

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,440
That smells so good!

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,320
Can we eat? Hurry up!

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, you can eat now.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,440
You haven't turned on the stove, babe.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,720
Do you want any condiments?

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,880
The condiments, they're right here.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
Anyone want condiments, guys?

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,800
Yes.
Where is it?

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,880
It's here.
Which one?

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Come here, quick!

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,080
Come on, hurry!

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,520
Hurry up, come here!

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:50,920
Here it is...

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,200
There's even dessert, seriously!

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
No need to be so polite.

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
What is this?

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,000
Is this a local specialty or something?

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,120
What's this in the middle?

30
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,200
I think so.
Is this tofu pudding?

31
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,600
Is this vinegar?
That's sesame oil.

32
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,400
Some sesame oil.

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Sesame oil with chili flakes.
I don't know.

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Let's just do it this way for now.

35
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,400
Where did you get your bowl?

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,560
It's right in front of me.
The one in front of me.

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,040
We've also got three-colored noodles.

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,920
Yeah, that's what I mean...

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Your pot's already boiling.

40
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,360
Yeah.

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,160
Let you have the sweet before the bitter.

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,080
Let you try the good stuff first.

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
This soup is so good!

44
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Thanks.
No problem.

45
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,880
Are you all hungry?
Go ahead, dig in!

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,160
As one hotpot ends, another begins.

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,840
This season continues right from where the last one finished.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Here we go.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,920
Nice!

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
So, what are we watching?

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,960
You really know your way around this.

52
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,520
Of course I do.

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,600
Last time, just before we finished filming,

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
you didn't get to have hotpot, did you?

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Nope.

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,759
Make sure you eat more today.

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,199
Here, have my meat.

58
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
He really stuck with us through the whole season.

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
When we wrapped up, he didn't even get to eat.

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,160
Yeah.

61
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
What else did you guys watch?

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
That drone show.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
The drone show was so beautiful.

64
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,320
Here, Bai.

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,080
Pass it over.

66
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Pass it over, thanks.

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Give them some, pass it over.

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,480
They don't have any over there.

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe you should give them some.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
They don't have any?

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Actually, they do.

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Don't have what?
They have shrimp balls.

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Thanks.

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
You're so nice.

75
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,400
There's shrimp balls.
No problem.

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,240
Thank you.

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
This isn't poisonous, is it?

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,480
And then the first case started.

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
Wait, it's us?

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Zhang Linghe is really getting good at looking after everyone.

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
It ran out just as it got to you.

82
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
Seriously, it's all gone.
There's more over there.

83
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Does Brother Ning have any new projects this year?

84
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
You should stay up to date.

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Take you for example,

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,480
Your latest show is about to be released, right?

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
By the time our show airs,

88
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
yours will probably be almost finished.

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,360
No wonder there was none left by the time it got to my younger brother.

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
I downloaded so many copies myself.

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
When I checked, I had five or six copies myself.

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,440
How did that happen?

93
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,840
I shared mine and Brother Bai's

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,760
with you all.

95
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,080
What’s Bai up to these days?

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Isn’t Bai filming too? Isn’t he with us?

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,760
No, he’s already finished shooting.

98
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
He just finished? Really?

99
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,240
Just finished?
I finished ages ago.

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,920
So, what now?

101
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
You just have to ask, huh?

102
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
You just love asking these kinds of questions.

103
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
You just toss the question out there.

104
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
So you can eat quietly while we answer.

105
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,480
I’m just taking a break.

106
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah, you deserve some rest.

107
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
How about you? What have you been doing lately?

108
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
Me? Lately...

109
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
I’ve had four gigs in total.

110
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
But lately, I’ve just been resting too.

111
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah, I’ve been resting recently as well.
Have you wrapped up filming?

112
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
No, not yet. I’m still with the crew.

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
You’re still with the crew too?
Yeah, in Hengdian.

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
He’s here with me.

115
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,760
We’re staying at the same hotel.

116
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,280
So that’s why you two flew to Ningbo together, huh?

117
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,840
Yeah.

118
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
You guys are in Hengdian?

119
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,680
Yeah.

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
I’m heading there soon.

121
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
Like, really soon.

122
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Why are you coming?

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,040
To shoot, obviously.
Why are you coming?

124
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Why else would I come?

125
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,400
I’m here as a stand-in.

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Reba, how have you been lately?

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
I just finished filming.

128
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,360
It's been almost a month since I wrapped up.

129
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah, almost a month.

130
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,680
You've been taking it easy lately too, right?

131
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,200
Yeah.
Just taking a break.

132
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,800
Gotta balance work and rest, you know.

133
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,440
This whole year, I—

134
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,280
I haven't seen Reba even once, right?

135
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,520
Yeah, it's been a whole year since we last saw each other.

136
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,960
That's right.

137
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
What about you and the others? Have you seen anyone else?

138
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,360
There was one time when our crew was filming right next to theirs.

139
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,960
Our crew was right next to theirs.

140
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,720
Yeah.

141
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
And I think there was another time

142
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,520
we were filming really close by too.

143
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
Come on, as a guy, couldn't you just go over

144
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,920
and say hi to your friends?

145
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,080
That day, I happened to be

146
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,680
shooting a night scene

147
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,400
with horses.

148
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Their crew was right next door,

149
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,720
and I even rode my horse

150
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
over to their set,
but I didn't see anyone,

151
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
so I just rode back.

152
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Sometimes we're split into A and B teams.

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
Not all the actors are always there.

154
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,000
You never know who's actually going to be there.
Yeah.

155
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
I met Brother Bai once at Hengdian.

156
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
Yeah, we met once.

157
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,360
Zhang Linghe, haven't you had a break in ages?

158
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,480
It's been ages since I had any time off.

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
I haven't had any time off at all.

160
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Are you okay with that?

161
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Me? I'm totally fine!

162
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
What keeps you going

163
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
to keep filming non-stop like this?

164
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,480
He just stares at his own face at home every day.

165
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
He's so handsome.

166
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
It'd be a shame not to film.

167
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Seriously.

168
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,880
You haven't taken a break at all since then.

169
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,160
I came here just to have fun with everyone, to relax.

170
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Just to relax.

171
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Yeah, exactly, just like this.

172
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
It's nice that this show lets a few of us

173
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,840
get together once a year, right?

174
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,800
I mean, can you even

175
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,840
have hot pot with everyone when you're on set?

176
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
Zhang Linghe, what kind of drama are you filming now?

177
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
What's the genre?

178
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
What role are you playing?

179
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm playing a general.

180
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
A general? Is it a costume drama?

181
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,360
Didn't you notice I seem a bit tougher this year

182
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,240
than last?

183
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,280
Let me think...

184
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,960
I saw some leaked photos.

185
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
You had two tufts of hair on your head,

186
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
like the Monkey King, right?

187
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Yeah, I saw that.
It looked really cool.

188
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,640
It really has a vibe.

189
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Doesn't it?

190
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,240
I saw you getting off the RV a couple of days ago.

191
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,720
They say you're really outgoing online, but in person

192
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,720
you don't even dare go out when you see people.

193
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
Yeah, I'm an introvert.

194
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,280
What? He got off the RV?

195
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
Yeah, on Valentine's Day online,

196
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,280
he was chatting with fans so enthusiastically.

197
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,480
But the next day, when fans came to meet him, he just

198
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Why are you paying so much attention to me?

199
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
Of course!

200
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
I get notifications for trending topics every day.

201
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
You missed five trending topics about Zhang Linghe today.

202
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,640
I don't know how to turn it off.

203
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Really?

204
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah, it keeps reminding me.

205
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,960
Did you follow his Super Topic?

206
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Nope.

207
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
Does she have a Special Follow set up?

208
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,680
I don't know.

209
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
Since I check it a lot, it keeps popping up.

210
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,360
No, mainly when I get on the trending page or something,

211
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
I send everything to Jin Jing.

212
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,400
She asks me to repost, comment, and like to help with the numbers.

213
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Yeah.

214
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,120
If there's something you want to eat, you can make a wish for it too.

215
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
Changsha actually has some really good food.

216
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,880
Stinky tofu!

217
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Yeah, I want to try stinky tofu too.

218
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
Is stinky tofu a Changsha specialty?

219
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,080
Kind of.

220
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,680
It's a specialty.

221
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
The black one, right?
Should we put it on our list?

222
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,400
Yeah, sure.

223
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm not against it.

224
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Alright.
Wait a sec, I have a question.

225
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,280
Are we going to... this season?

226
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,920
So, during the case, will there still be

227
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,440
those meal times that get filmed?

228
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,160
Yeah, there will be.

229
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,280
So that means we don't need to set aside a separate time just for meals, right?

230
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
He means, are there still

231
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,880
cafeteria scenes like in the first season?

232
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,080
You know, like in the first season, when everyone was in the cafeteria, eating and chatting together.

233
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,000
Eating while talking about clues and stuff.

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Eating and discussing clues.

235
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
There will be some parts like that.

236
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
But they're probably not set in stone.

237
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
It depends on the schedule.

238
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
Wait, there was a cafeteria in the first season?

239
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,720
Yeah, we had a communal cafeteria where we'd eat and chat.

240
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,720
We'd eat and chat.

241
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,640
But Bai, didn't you used to not talk much during meals?

242
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,280
You wouldn't say anything while eating.

243
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
He was always the fastest eater, remember?

244
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
He'd just focus on eating.

245
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,240
So when does Bai actually talk, then?

246
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
He actually talked a lot last season.

247
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
I talk all the time.

248
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,480
Yeah, he really did talk a lot last season.

249
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,240
Yeah.
That's great.

250
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,800
So, compared to last season...

251
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
Any new updates?

252
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,080
Oh, there definitely will be.

253
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,960
You'll see tomorrow.

254
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
So it's still a secret, huh?

255
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,680
Wasn't the culprit's capture rate pretty low last season?

256
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
It was actually pretty high.

257
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,920
Really? I always felt like I couldn't catch the culprit.

258
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
Isn't that Bai Yu's fault though?

259
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,400
I'll take the fall.

260
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,800
How did we rank last season?

261
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,880
How did it end up again?

262
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
Bai Yu came in first.

263
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
Who came in last?

264
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
Me. I was last.

265
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,880
Conan.

266
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
No, I'm not Conan.

267
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm just muddling through.

268
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Alright, since everyone's talking about it,

269
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,880
There are so many memories from last season.

270
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,600
So let's eat

271
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
while we look back

272
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,480
at some of last season's most memorable moments.

273
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay.

274
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,360
The first case.

275
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
The "Beam in the Pitch-Black Night" case, right?

276
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,320
How do I feel about it

277
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
What are my thoughts

278
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,440
Who would've guessed you wrote the name backwards

279
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,080
Do you remember what the story was during that recording session

280
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Do you remember what the story was

281
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Wasn't it something about a cabaret

282
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
There were all kinds of young commanders, right

283
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,600
I think it was the first case
Bali's Scissors

284
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Yeah

285
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,560
Something about the Long-Haired Witch

286
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Yeah, the Long-Haired Witch

287
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
Each of us pressed one

288
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,800
the highest button

289
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Then he chased us in the hallway.

290
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,600
Then you have to press and hold it, and not move.

291
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah.
And then someone appeared

292
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,640
and suddenly the lights went out.

293
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
He looked like an acrobat.

294
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,840
Then he'd do this

295
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,920
and come right up to you.

296
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,880
That was really scary.

297
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
"Go away!"

298
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
He actually touched you!

299
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you remember that

300
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
secret passage button from back then?

301
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,240
The ending for that NPC

302
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,880
was getting caught by Bai Ge, wasn't it?

303
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,240
Quick, grab him!

304
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Hurry!

305
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,520
Get him!

306
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,080
Got him!

307
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,800
He's always trying to catch people.

308
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,520
Always after people.

309
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
No, that's not it.

310
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
He just likes catching people whenever he has nothing better to do.

311
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,280
He just enjoys it.

312
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,320
He's our team's tank.

313
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,560
He's super tough.

314
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,360
I remember, actually,

315
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,880
I was invited to the first episode.

316
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,400
But I was pregnant then and hadn't told anyone yet.

317
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,120
So we thought,

318
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,600
I probably shouldn't go—it was way too scary.

319
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,280
Good thing you didn't come. That episode was seriously scary.

320
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
That was probably the scariest one.

321
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,720
Yeah, I think so—at least for me.

322
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
No, the bathroom one was the scariest.

323
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
That one was really terrifying too.

324
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,800
The one with the spinning plate—

325
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
the solo mission—that was so scary.
That one was really scary.

326
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Everyone had to go in by themselves for that one.

327
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,920
Didn't you guys have partners?

328
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,760
Yeah, the three of us went together,

329
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,880
but at first, I had to go in alone.

330
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Actually, out of the whole team,

331
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
in terms of overall courage,

332
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,840
the three of us were the least brave.

333
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,160
It was the three of us back then, right?

334
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,200
Yeah, just the three of us.

335
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
Is it the one who did the poisoning?

336
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,880
Yeah.
Yogurt Lump?

337
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,360
The saxophone guy still had a bewildered look on his face.

338
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,080
What's that?

339
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,640
But actually, what stood out to me most in this episode

340
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,280
wasn't this part.

341
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,360
Brother Xun

342
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,600
Reba tried to touch Brother Xun's forehead.

343
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,480
Was that you?

344
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,360
No, I touched a lot of people.

345
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,520
I touched Zhang Linghe.

346
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,040
Then I grabbed your clothes.

347
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,720
And you just pretended to be someone else.

348
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
But honestly, I couldn't tell who was who.

349
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
I knew.

350
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,960
Even in the darkness,
I could recognize Brother Xun.

351
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,960
You were trying to scare him, weren't you?

352
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,640
Yeah.
But I got caught right away.

353
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
Quick, I want to see!

354
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,800
That's the one.

355
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,040
Yeah.

356
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,760
You guys have to listen to this part.

357
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,520
It's about Zhang Linghe's forehead.

358
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
Why do I look like I don't have any teeth?

359
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,200
You're just too much...

360
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,560
Grabbing legs is totally cheating.

361
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
That's so scary!

362
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,000
He actually bit me!

363
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
He bit you?

364
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
He really did bite me.

365
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,720
Reba thought our show

366
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
wasn't scary enough,

367
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,800
so she made it even scarier for us.

368
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,080
She ended up scaring herself.

369
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,160
No, it's just that I kind of...

370
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
Back in school,

371
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,960
when I went to haunted houses with my classmates, it was the same.

372
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,560
If there weren't any ghosts, I'd pretend to be one.

373
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,120
You'd be the ghost?

374
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,560
I'd act as the ghost and scare others,

375
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,720
just to give everyone the full experience.

376
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,920
I think this is the first time we've had

377
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,240
people who aren't playing roles, right?

378
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't think we've had that before.

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,320
So I didn't expect there would actually be real ones.

380
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,520
I thought it would just be dark in there.

381
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,960
So I scared Zhang Linghe,

382
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,240
and then I scared you too,

383
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
Liu Yuning.
Yeah.

384
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,200
I didn't expect there would actually be real ones later.

385
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,240
So they don't need me anymore.

386
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Brother Bai still has to protect us this season—

387
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,040
protect us!

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,680
No way. Not a chance.

389
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,680
No way.

390
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,040
He would never protect us.

391
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,080
When you were on the show,

392
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,400
Every time the lights go out, he just takes off on his own.

393
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
He just rushes ahead by himself.

394
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah, he runs off so fast.

395
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,040
He doesn't even care about us.
Seriously, though.

396
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,240
Not only that, he even scares us.

397
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,000
I've got a special mission this episode.
He even tries to scare us.

398
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah, he'll go ahead, wait for us, and then suddenly jump out to scare us.

399
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,520
Then suddenly jump out and scare us.

400
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,960
He's always like that.

401
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,280
I've got a special mission this season.

402
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,280
Yeah, right.
What special mission?

403
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm not telling you.

404
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
Don't believe him.
He's making up a new persona for himself again.

405
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,080
He's just making it all up.

406
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,520
There's no special mission at all.

407
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
Jin Jing, the two times you were here, it really wasn't that scary.

408
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,760
It wasn't that scary.

409
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,520
And it was always Reba who protected me.

410
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
I actually wanted Zhang Linghe to protect me.

411
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
But when it really mattered,

412
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
he pushed me over to you.

413
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,600
This is so scary.

414
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
Close your eyes first.

415
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
Come a bit closer over here.

416
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,520
Xiao Ba, you're the best.

417
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,480
I was scared to death.

418
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
And Zhang Linghe, you're really no help at all.

419
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,240
Whenever the lights go out, I run to you.

420
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
You just push me towards Reba.

421
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
You tell me to go to her.

422
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
And then you push me away.

423
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm honestly scared too.

424
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Do you know what nickname Ning and I have?

425
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,760
Last season, we had a nickname:

426
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Crouching Dragon and Young Phoenix.

427
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,320
We're pretty much the same.

428
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Yeah, we're the same way.

429
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,920
You're scared too, aren't you?

430
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm honestly scared.

431
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,600
Ning's honestly terrified, he really is.

432
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,280
But here's how I see it:

433
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,880
Maybe when we're filming,

434
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,840
you're really immersed in the moment,

435
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,440
so you get scared.
But when you watch the show later,

436
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,400
you feel like it's no big deal.

437
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,440
I wonder, "What was so scary about that?"

438
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,400
I always feel that way.

439
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,080
What is it?
Oh, I remember!

440
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,960
I've always taken from you, yet never said thank you.

441
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,880
This episode was really a brain teaser.

442
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,320
Seriously, it was tough.
Yeah, really tough.

443
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,640
It was about the ship.

444
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,720
That ship.
Yeah, that ship.

445
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,160
You know, like the Titanic.

446
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
It's about a family.

447
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,600
The whole family.

448
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,280
The more you think about it, the creepier it gets.

449
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Thinking back, this episode was pretty scary.

450
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
But that's just one side of it.

451
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,760
But I think what made this episode really tough was...

452
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,480
At first, we thought there were two timelines.

453
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,360
Then three.

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
Yeah, and then it started looping.

455
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,120
Right, Zhen Tui and Tui Zhen.

456
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,920
So, just two timelines.

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
Wait, who was the culprit this time?

458
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh right, it was me.

459
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
You know what was really funny that day?

460
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,080
It was me, Zhang Linghe, and Zhou Keyu.

461
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
The three of us.

462
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
None of us planned it.

463
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,280
But all three of us showed up with white hair that day.

464
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,480
And the funny thing is, in that episode, the three of us were actually family.

465
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,720
We were related by blood.

466
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,200
In that episode, the three of us were related.
I was his father, right?

467
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
And he was my

468
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,040
full brother.

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
With the white hair, I ended up looking like my own dad.

470
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,240
Fever.

471
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
Fever.

472
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
You're really going all in on the villain act.

473
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,480
It's like I'm just here for the show.

474
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
Female lead drama

475
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I still really want to watch it

476
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,720
Got dragged away by a cow

477
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
I've got a fever.

478
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,960
Even now, just seeing this,

479
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,839
I'm still at a loss for words.

480
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,480
His ears turned completely red.

481
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,200
That's hilarious.

482
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,800
I think this part is really funny.

483
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,040
It's mainly because your reactions were so real.

484
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Can I ask you something?
When I usually talk,

485
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
Do I always sound like this?

486
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah.

487
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,120
I always thought I sounded normal.

488
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
I didn't realize I sounded so fake.

489
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,720
I love these kinds of scripts.

490
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,960
Me too.
The ones where the character is super popular—I just love watching those.

491
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,440
I really enjoy watching them.

492
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,480
Yeah, because it's pretty much how my life is.

493
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,160
Because I just can't

494
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,840
play roles that are too different from who I am.

495
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,800
Honestly, I'm not that good at acting.

496
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
No, that's not true.

497
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,360
No, really, I'm actually pretty bad.

498
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
I'm just more used to playing the popular type, since that's basically my real life.

499
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
Because that's how my life is.

500
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,200
So I don't have to overthink it at all.

501
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,840
No need to overthink.

502
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
But for other roles,

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,000
—even in "Start Reasoning"—

504
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,920
when I get the script,

505
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
I have to write a whole backstory for the character.

506
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,120
Sometimes, even after filming,

507
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,200
it takes me more than two weeks to get out of character.

508
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,640
Must be nice.

509
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
So what's your character like this season?

510
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,080
No set persona.

511
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
I think we should just let ourselves go.

512
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,080
So maybe we could

513
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,440
continue what they did last season?

514
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm sure there will be.

515
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,160
I'll get caught up in those love-hate entanglements too.

516
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,840
There will be.
I really love watching those kinds of storylines.

517
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,720
You want to join in too, don't you?

518
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,080
Bai Yu wants to join in too, right?

519
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah, join in!

520
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,920
Yeah, what I regret about last season is

521
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,240
that Bai Yu and I didn't have any romantic plotlines with you.

522
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,040
That was really disappointing.
Seriously.

523
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,400
Was there?
Not with him, though.

524
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
I have to have a storyline with Bai Yu—

525
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,680
a really genuine one.

526
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,120
There was a scene in the "White Swan" one.

527
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,040
The "White Swan" one.

528
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,080
There was a bit in the stage play.

529
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
But not in the others.
Yeah.

530
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,480
There was something in the play.

531
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,120
What the hell are you doing?

532
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,600
You just killed me without even saying a word!

533
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,920
There are kissing scenes too, right?

534
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,120
How moving.

535
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
How romantic.

536
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,320
Her two ex-boyfriends are in the audience.

537
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,160
They look furious.

538
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
As for my persona,

539
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,000
I’m someone who likes boxing.

540
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,080
You know?

541
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
Always dodging punches.

542
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,040
Do you remember that play?

543
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
I was totally mesmerized by those two swans

544
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,960
—completely charmed.

545
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
They had me completely wrapped around their fingers.

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,720
In the end, they won.

547
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah, that was the highlight of the episode.

548
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,040
(The real highlight.)

549
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,360
They were incredible.

550
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
They really underestimated us.

551
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
They didn’t expect the two of us

552
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,440
to be so good.

553
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,040
Come on, give them a round of applause.

554
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
That was awesome.

555
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,920
But honestly, what are we mainly about?

556
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,760
We didn’t really have the heart to go after you guys too hard.

557
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,280
Oh, please.

558
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,600
So this season, we might

559
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,240
just have to let some things go

560
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
and really go after them.

561
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,080
Really?
But in our episode,

562
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
we also couldn’t bring ourselves to go all out against you.

563
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,320
So we already went easy on you.

564
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,760
Alright.

565
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,400
That was Reba's first time as X.

566
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,280
Right?
Yeah.

567
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,920
It was fun.

568
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,200
Being X was fun.

569
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,400
The coolest thing was that Reba was still right there, you know—

570
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
She even started arguing with me, or something like that.

571
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
We pretended we were on different sides.

572
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
What was it she did that day again?

573
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,160
She went to back up Zhang Linghe.

574
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,320
And then she pulled me into it too.

575
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,680
At that moment, you know,

576
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,040
I mean,

577
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,240
I was cheering for her inside.

578
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,960
She was awesome that day.

579
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,120
I was really impressed by her.

580
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Looking back at the show,

581
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,160
You were helping her out from behind the scenes,

582
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
helping her out of trouble,

583
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
but you didn't step into the spotlight.

584
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,720
Yeah.

585
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
And she was the one taking the heat up front,

586
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
just talking non-stop.

587
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,520
So you two managed to stay hidden really well.

588
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,520
It was awesome.
We had such a good time that day.

589
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,840
Let's replay this episode—

590
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
I want to watch it again right now.

591
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,720
Sure, don't worry.

592
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
The members will definitely watch this episode.

593
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,040
Because it was just so good.

594
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,000
Isn't this it?

595
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,640
This one's a lot of fun too.

596
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,880
I have to say, you're actually pretty smart.

597
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,560
Me?
Yeah, that's right.

598
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Bai Yu.

599
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
Why are you so cheeky?

600
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,240
Roommate's scratching their head.

601
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,800
You're such a joker.

602
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,160
So, looking back now,

603
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,480
Do you know why we're laughing?

604
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,440
Yeah, I know.
Of course.

605
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm pretty sure he figured it out on the spot.

606
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Didn't everyone kind of

607
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,080
mutate or something that time?

608
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,960
Right.

609
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
Everyone turned into pig heads, didn't they?

610
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,880
That was the episode with the curse, right?

611
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,600
Bullying

612
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,000
The school bullying episode

613
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,360
Then he turned into a pig, right?

614
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:54,680
Yeah.

615
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
And I was the one covered in blood.

616
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,440
I was the one wrapped in bandages.

617
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,600
What about you, Zhang Linghe? What did you turn into?

618
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
I didn't turn into anything, did I?

619
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,600
You did.
No, he didn't.

620
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,680
He did, didn't he?

621
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,120
That was his girlfriend's transformation.

622
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,040
The one where I was bullied, right?

623
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
No, that wasn't me.

624
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,360
Uh, this one...

625
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,920
This was my darkest moment.

626
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,120
Yours looks so pretty.

627
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,320
Your eyebrow piercing looks good too.

628
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
I remember you kept forgetting it that time.

629
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah.
What's up?

630
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
Is this the one when I was moving boxes?

631
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,880
What's wrong?

632
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,800
I don't know.

633
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,320
I told you, I'm an idiot.
See, I told you.

634
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Just playing it up for the show.

635
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,480
No, that's not it.

636
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
But why, though?

637
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,120
So you didn't sleep well that night, huh?

638
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,800
No, that day I honestly...

639
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,760
I didn't know how to do it.

640
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
It just didn't click for me right then.

641
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,840
Since I didn't know the method, I just memorized the rules.

642
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,600
No, not at all.

643
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,120
I just didn't get it that day.

644
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,920
In your mind, I’m not supposed to be this clueless, am I?

645
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,040
I shouldn't be this slow, right?

646
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,560
Yeah.

647
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,480
I always thought I was smart too.

648
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,200
But that day, for some reason,

649
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,440
I just got all mixed up about this.

650
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,040
Sorry, I didn't upload it, did I?

651
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
Looks like someone didn't make it.

652
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
Looks like one person didn't pull it off.

653
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,880
Guess that's me.

654
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
Got it.

655
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,480
That's your problem.

656
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,040
Go move the boxes.

657
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
Everything's out in the open.

658
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,280
Alright, who still remembers the theme this time?

659
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,200
That robot.

660
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,000
Robot.

661
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,160
The one that could take off its arm, I think.

662
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
Yeah, and there was also that magic wand thing.

663
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,800
We slept in the prison.

664
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,480
No, not "slept with"—

665
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,880
We were just lying there.
We just took a nap.

666
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,680
Yeah, we just took a nap.

667
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,840
We time-traveled using the brain-computer interface.

668
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
With the brain-computer interface, we traveled through time.

669
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,760
Then we became that person—

670
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,480
The one who jumped off the clock tower.

671
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,160
That case, remember?

672
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,280
You were the culprit, weren't you?

673
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
That was the one where we went into the future.
I was the culprit.

674
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
He was the culprit two episodes in a row.

675
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,480
Yeah, two episodes in a row, it was him.
Second-to-last episode.

676
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,920
After that, it was still him.
Even in the last episode, it was him.

677
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
The most crucial clue—

678
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
He could flick people with his finger, just like my dad.

679
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,360
I can't believe I forgot about that.

680
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,440
I still can't get over it.

681
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,760
I think last season,

682
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
you were actually the one who grew the most.

683
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
You really were the one who grew the most.

684
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,880
In what way did I grow?

685
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
Well, at first,

686
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
in the first episode,

687
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
you looked really confused.

688
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
But by the last episode, you’d already played the killer twice in a row.

689
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,760
You did really well.

690
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
You kept that confused look the whole time—

691
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
even in the last episode.

692
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,680
But actually, you were the killer.

693
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,120
Yeah.

694
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
That never changed.
Not anymore.

695
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,880
I've changed my mindset.
This season,

696
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,920
I won't be so clueless anymore.

697
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Just you wait.

698
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,520
This season, we won't be looking out for you anymore.

699
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,000
Come up here.

700
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,400
Bai Yu and I are both going to go after you.

701
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,160
We're going to attack you with no mercy.
Bully you.

702
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Yeah, no holding back.

703
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,880
You know why I toughened up?

704
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
It's because of you two.

705
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,680
That's why I brought Jin Jing in at the time.

706
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,400
Because Bai Yu was always bullying you,

707
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,080
so you called Jin Jing for backup.

708
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Right.

709
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,800
And Jin Jing really managed to keep Bai Yu in check.

710
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,920
After I left, did things get better for you?

711
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,440
No.
Still not.

712
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Lingering effects.

713
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
You broke his spirit.

714
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,440
He never bounced back.

715
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
Perfect.

716
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,880
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

717
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,680
We're back!

718
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,139
Helimo Yu Detective Team

719
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,659
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

720
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:26,819
Waiting for you

721
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:33,699
We are the new residents who just moved in

722
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:34,939
in Apartment 11

723
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:35,739
We'll be neighbors from now on
We can look out for each other

724
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:39,179
Bai Song, Guo Zhou

725
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:39,899
Liu Ku

726
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,219
Helimo Jin Yu

727
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,859
Because we are a family

728
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:45,819
What is this thing?

729
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,899
We're trying everything we can to escape now

730
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,859
Helimo Jin Yu Detective Team

731
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,499
Let's start reasoning

732
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:10,579
This is City Radio FM0424

733
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:12,059
Latest report from the Meteorological Bureau

734
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,099
This week will see

735
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,899
an unprecedented cold wave

736
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,819
Please take precautions against the cold

737
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,739
Entertainment news

738
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,099
The third season of "Let's Start Reasoning"

739
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,139
is about to begin

740
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,299
The entire cast of Helimo Jinyu will gather

741
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,619
for a special team-building event lasting a day and a night

742
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:27,419
Let's all look forward to Helimo Jinyu

743
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,859
Hello, everyone

744
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,779
I'm your big sister, Jin Jing

745
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,139
Village Grand Stage

746
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:43,019
Village Grand Stage

747
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,979
is waiting for me to arrive

748
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:50,339
Before we start the story reasoning

749
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,499
let's have Helimo Jinyu

750
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,499
first enjoy a joyful

751
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:55,899
team-building trip

752
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,499
The first one to walk towards us

753
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,899
The god of wisdom is soft-hearted toward her

754
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,179
The god of beauty is captivated by her

755
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,539
She can always find clues in her memories

756
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,259
And clear away the fog at critical moments

757
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,219
Why is there no Ke Mu San

758
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:14,459
You are Ke Mu San

759
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,379
You are representing the people of this era

760
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:17,739
Sitting here and talking with us

761
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:19,499
The person you suspect now is me

762
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,699
I am the "killer"

763
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:23,899
The one who "killed" Thomas

764
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,779
The descendant of He Shaoshuai won the Three Push Award

765
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:27,819
He just said it himself

766
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,539
I'm with Zi Daole.

767
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,459
We're both artists signed with TYP.

768
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,779
We even have couple names.

769
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,179
Ke Daole, Zi Daole.

770
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,499
You don't really have anything to do with Zi Daole.

771
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,779
You're his ex-boyfriend.

772
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,219
I'm not.

773
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,779
You have nothing to do with my girlfriend.

774
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:46,379
No.

775
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:48,779
They're fighting.

776
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,059
Mr. Wang asked me to go over tonight.

777
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:51,859
To warm up his bed for him.

778
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,339
Warm up the bed.

779
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,339
The whole place is getting excited.

780
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,459
Let's welcome

781
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:01,179
Dilireba.

782
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,459
Next up,

783
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,299
is the backbone of our "Let's Start Reasoning"
the core member.

784
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,739
Although when he's investigating,

785
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,899
he lies down anywhere whenever he has free time.

786
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:13,779
Why don't we sit down and figure it out?

787
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:16,659
But we have to admit,

788
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:18,499
wherever he is, there's a strong sense of security.

789
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,059
Is it that hard?

790
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:21,779
Is the door open?

791
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,979
The door's open, right?

792
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:24,499
Come, follow me, come on.

793
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:25,499
It's fine, come on, follow me.

794
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,659
Follow me, keep up from behind.

795
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,699
He's the star detective from last season.

796
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:31,179
Bai Yu.

797
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,419
He has enviably long legs.

798
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,699
He's a warm-hearted guy who's both timid and tough.

799
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,819
When it comes to tricks, he leads us in analyzing the logic.

800
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,699
He must have been, at the moment he landed,

801
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,539
this window was closed.
But he definitely is

802
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,339
the one who cast the spell in 1988.

803
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:53,899
And those two are from the "River of Helplessness."

804
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:54,619
You get it, right?

805
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:55,779
Aren't you the "X killer"?

806
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,459
How do you play two against three? Tell me.

807
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,499
After the lights go out,

808
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,139
you hear him bravely shouting for help.

809
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:00,899
No.

810
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,699
Don't mess with me, sis.

811
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,219
Don't—don't scare me.

812
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:05,738
Don't move.

813
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:06,779
Right.

814
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:09,699
He is one of us.

815
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:11,619
He is the best bro to Heli and Jin Yu.

816
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:15,059
Liu Yuning.

817
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:18,219
And the next one,

818
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,539
My heart races in his presence.

819
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:26,779
In his hands, my pulse races.

820
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:29,579
He is my personal pulse doctor.

821
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,099
Born into a prestigious family.

822
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:32,499
Dangerous and charming.

823
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,499
This time, you got a top-tier character.

824
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:35,659
"The Mad Lord"

825
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:36,819
Take these "Mad Lord" traits

826
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:38,739
and push all these elements to the extreme.

827
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:39,979
I'm a hopeless romantic.

828
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,459
Master.

829
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,819
You can go eat now.

830
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,739
Perfectly captures every character.

831
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:47,859
Also a puzzle-solving machine.

832
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:48,859
The time for X

833
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:51,259
Does that mean Y divided by 1.4?

834
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,019
X equals 2.
The year 2002.

835
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:54,819
Five hundred and fifty can.

836
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,179
That means fifty can't.

837
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:58,219
Subtract this integer

838
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,059
and you get one hundred and three.

839
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,339
One-three-zero has opened.

840
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,059
A master of contrast.

841
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,819
An immersive healer.

842
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,579
The one who set my heart racing all season,

843
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:12,059
Zhang Linghe.

844
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,699
You really treat him differently.

845
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,739
Your pitch goes up so much.

846
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,339
The last to walk the carpet is

847
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,499
the sharp-tongued youngest of "Let’s Start Reasoning".

848
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,099
He has mastered

849
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,059
the art of conversation.

850
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:29,539
At worst, you just "died".

851
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:30,459
Then why didn’t you "die"?
Exactly.

852
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,259
How did you survive?

853
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,699
Why aren’t you the one who "died" today?

854
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,019
You should have "died" yesterday.

855
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,739
When will you finally "die"?

856
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,979
He never drops the ball at critical moments.

857
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:40,979
I got it.

858
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,379
This place opened in 1910.

859
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,459
It lost money for a year.

860
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,859
Then in 1911, it started to meet

861
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,059
after that guest arrived.

862
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:47,659
After the mystery was solved.
It began to make a profit.

863
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:50,819
So that was 1911.

864
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,779
I remember now.

865
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,899
When he was flipping through and reading here,

866
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:55,739
he kept doing this.

867
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,579
He had already gotten it at that time.

868
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:04,419
He truly deserves to be called the encyclopedia of Ke.

869
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,299
His hands and mind are both super fast.

870
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,259
Ke Yu, please accept your sister's love.

871
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:15,419
After such a long time,

872
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:16,979
He Li and Mo Yu have reunited again.

873
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:17,699
Yes.

874
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:18,899
She's here then.

875
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,659
So, should we use this name?

876
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:21,619
Yes.
It's already changed.

877
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:22,699
Has it changed?
It has.

878
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,699
He Li Mo Jin Yu.

879
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,539
Now it's He Li Mo Jin Yu.
Yes.
Okay, good.

880
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:26,539
Yes.

881
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,139
You changed it for me.

882
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,219
You're really good to me.

883
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:29,979
Of course.
I'm your brother.

884
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,539
I'm the "golden snub-nosed monkey."

885
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:32,499
Your real brother.

886
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,619
Alright, then let's

887
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,379
leave our signatures on the board.

888
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,739
Then we'll go in.

889
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,259
Let's explore the tomb together.

890
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:48,539
He Li explores the tomb.

891
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,579
He Li explores the tomb.

892
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:55,619
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

893
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,299
We're here.

894
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:01,419
The door opened, really.

895
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:03,099
Push it inward.

896
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:11,699
The environment in here is a bit better.

897
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:20,739
Hello.

898
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:21,499
Hello.
Hi, everyone.

899
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:22,979
Are you the ones from
the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning"?

900
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,299
Here for the team-building event, right?
Yes.

901
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:25,299
That's right.
Yes, sir.

902
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,419
Wait a moment.
Are you

903
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,179
Cao Yangguang's father?

904
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:31,819
Is that right?

905
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,059
Who let you in?

906
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,619
Cao Yangguang's father.

907
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,379
Then please call the police.

908
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,659
Let me introduce myself.

909
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,179
I'm the manager of this manor.

910
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,019
My surname is Lin.
You can just call me Lao Lin.

911
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:42,579
Lao Lin.

912
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:44,459
Let me give everyone a brief introduction

913
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,539
to our manor.

914
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:46,539
The scenery here
is really beautiful.

915
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,339
We have a kitchen in the manor,

916
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,499
a dining room, and an activity room.

917
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,019
There's also a fishing area.

918
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:55,019
We can meet all your team-building needs.

919
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:57,819
This is our staff bulletin board.

920
00:35:57,819 --> 00:35:58,859
Everyone can take a look.

921
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,179
Three cats, three dogs.

922
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:02,059
There's a cow and a chicken.

923
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:03,619
Here comes one.

924
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,699
It's even wearing clothes.

925
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,059
Badi.
Badi.

926
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:12,259
Hello, Badi.
This is Diba.

927
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:18,219
By the way, everyone,

928
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,819
your meeting point is up ahead.

929
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:20,898
I still have some other things to do.
So I won't go with you, okay?

930
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:22,739
Okay.
Have a great team-building event.

931
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:24,459
Alright.
Let's go.

932
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,459
Badi, let's go.

933
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:27,659
Badi.

934
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:29,699
Badi.

935
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,899
Everybody.

936
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:34,619
For team-building, please go this way.

937
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:37,779
It even has a nose ring.

938
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,739
Sing a duet with it.

939
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:44,419
Do you recognize me?

940
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,699
How far do we have to be?

941
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:48,619
Be careful.

942
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,059
Wait, don't start fighting.

943
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:50,819
Zhang Linghe.

944
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,619
Don't provoke it.

945
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,979
They really have a bad temper.

946
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,139
They really are stubborn.

947
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,339
Let's go.

948
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,539
There probably aren't any clues, right?

949
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:02,299
No.

950
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:04,259
There hasn't been a case today.

951
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:05,659
This is the camping kitchen.

952
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,539
We're here every day.

953
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:09,899
No way, right?

954
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,099
Is there anything here?

955
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:17,779
There's nothing.

956
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,179
Are we going to have to answer questions later?

957
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,659
How many orange cups are there in total?

958
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:24,819
No way.

959
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,859
That's such a mean idea.

960
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,579
No.

961
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:31,579
You guys are already getting into the mood.

962
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:32,659
It probably won't happen so soon.

963
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:36,819
Or maybe, how many English sentences are there in total?

964
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:37,939
Say three of them.

965
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:43,139
For team building, please go straight ahead.

966
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:43,779
It's in here.

967
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:45,099
Alright.

968
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:55,499
Alright, let's welcome everyone once again.

969
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:57,299
Welcome, He Li Mo and Jin Yu.

970
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,099
to the third season of "Let's Start Reasoning".

971
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:04,259
So since this is

972
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,499
the team-building event for season three of "Let's Start Reasoning,"

973
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:09,659
we hope everyone can improve their teamwork.

974
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:10,659
At the same time,

975
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:12,459
we also hope you can complete the tasks

976
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,659
and win

977
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,779
booster cards

978
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:18,099
booster cards.

979
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:20,539
The booster cards will

980
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:22,259
help you in the upcoming investigation process

981
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,139
by providing you with some real advantages.

982
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,739
Clues about the "culprit,"

983
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,219
key evidence,

984
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,619
and who is X.

985
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,379
Right.

986
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,819
Are the booster cards usable throughout the entire season?

987
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,139
Next,

988
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:40,539
let's begin our first challenge.

989
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,299
The first activity is called "Take My Photo".

990
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,059
Everyone needs to

991
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,619
take a set of promotional photos for the third season of "Start Reasoning".

992
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,339
shoot a set of promotional pictures.

993
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,259
You have one hour to take the photos.

994
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,219
When the time is up,

995
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,179
please each select six photos to print.

996
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,299
Five should be solo shots of other players,

997
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,019
and one should be a group photo with them.

998
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,899
In the end, you and thirty staff members

999
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:00,779
will vote together.

1000
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:02,019
The top two in the vote

1001
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,099
can draw a season three bonus card.

1002
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,859
The photo equipment will be decided by a blind box draw.

1003
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:11,899
The person who gets the CCD camera

1004
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:13,299
can't use the viewfinder

1005
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:14,739
can only shoot blindly

1006
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,059
Easy

1007
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,179
Really?

1008
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:20,459
This one

1009
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,539
The instant camera

1010
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,139
The person who gets the instant camera

1011
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:24,939
only has six sheets of film

1012
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,979
I really should

1013
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:30,979
be the substitute photographer

1014
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:32,139
Today, I'm the substitute photographer

1015
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,339
There's a "site brother" (fan photographer)

1016
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,259
The person who draws the DSLR

1017
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,739
must make sure every photo

1018
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,899
includes an animal from the manor

1019
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,539
I have a phone, that's fine too

1020
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:42,939
Not bad

1021
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:44,459
The person who gets the phone

1022
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:44,939
can only use

1023
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:46,499
their toes to press the shutter

1024
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:48,179
Toes

1025
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:55,579
Is that for real?

1026
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,739
Awesome.

1027
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:03,619
Awesome.
No.

1028
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,139
Wait a second.
Awesome.

1029
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,179
Do you know today I

1030
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:08,459
am wearing how many pairs of socks inside?

1031
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:09,059
Four pairs.

1032
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:10,379
It's fine, just cut it open.

1033
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:12,579
Because I can't take it off.

1034
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,419
No response.

1035
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,459
There's a way, you can use the countdown to take a photo.

1036
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:17,539
Select it first.

1037
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,699
Then just put your foot on it.

1038
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,659
You're so smart.

1039
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,899
No, how do you take this photo?

1040
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:25,419
What's this?

1041
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:27,979
How do you take this photo?
What's this?

1042
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,459
What is this thing?

1043
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:35,379
It suits you.

1044
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:36,939
Otherwise, you're the younger brother, right?

1045
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:37,779
Kids' watch.
It suits you.

1046
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:40,459
How do you take a picture with this?

1047
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,859
Whoever gets the phone watch

1048
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,899
has to figure out how to use it on their own.

1049
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:47,659
Yours is even worse.

1050
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:49,219
No.

1051
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,619
This is a drone.

1052
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,659
This one will definitely win first place.

1053
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,939
This is so cool.

1054
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:56,139
It really suits him.

1055
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,499
Because he doesn't want to move at all.

1056
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:58,459
I can take pictures of you.

1057
00:40:58,619 --> 00:40:59,299
Yeah.

1058
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,619
Why am I the only one with this?

1059
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:02,899
That's awesome.

1060
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,699
Whoever gets the drone

1061
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,859
has to figure out how to use it on their own.

1062
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:09,139
There are no specific requirements.

1063
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:09,659
Okay.

1064
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:10,699
All right.

1065
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,139
Do you know how to use this now?

1066
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:14,179
It doesn't matter, just ignore me.

1067
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,659
Don't end up crying if you can't figure it out.

1068
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:18,139
I don't want to see your tears.

1069
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,259
Falling into your beard.

1070
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,219
I'll go first, then.

1071
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,459
You take a group photo first.

1072
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,179
Is that okay?

1073
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:27,099
Alright.

1074
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,299
Come on.

1075
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,659
Take one.

1076
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,619
Is it really this casual?

1077
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,179
Actually, this is a really cool way to take photos.

1078
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:33,459
You wear it on your hand and take the photo like this.

1079
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,899
But you have to tap the screen.

1080
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:37,499
Everyone's here, right?

1081
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,019
Cool.

1082
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,339
Let’s see if it’s there.
Let me take a look.

1083
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:42,539
Is Bai Yu in it?
Yes.

1084
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:44,979
Take a look.

1085
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:49,699
It actually looks pretty good.

1086
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:50,979
It has a kind of blurry vibe.

1087
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,219
Not bad.

1088
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,099
No need for any beauty filter.
Yeah.

1089
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:54,579
It smooths the skin automatically.

1090
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,219
Hurry, take a solo shot.

1091
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,019
Come on, let's go.
Alright, let's go.

1092
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:59,699
Let's stroll around and see which spot works.

1093
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:00,859
No.

1094
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:02,219
I want to know how to turn on this camera.

1095
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:03,859
Really?

1096
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:05,179
Yeah, didn't it just not turn on?

1097
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:07,939
It's on now.
Nice.

1098
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,499
Yours isn't on.

1099
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:11,339
And you're supposed to be the photographer.

1100
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:12,979
Sorry.
Just started.

1101
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:15,659
Only got an hour.

1102
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,419
Let Kexu finish those shots first.

1103
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:18,139
You take the solo shots.
Where do you want to shoot?

1104
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:19,619
Hurry up.

1105
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,819
The model's here.

1106
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:22,499
Guys,
Hurry and give it to him.

1107
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:23,939
Give it to him.
It's your turn.

1108
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:26,299
Hurry up and let him take the photos first.

1109
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:27,539
Quick, I've already got my pose ready.

1110
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:33,739
Don't move.

1111
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:38,459
Bro.

1112
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:41,219
Impressive or what?

1113
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:44,379
I'm so cool, aren't I?

1114
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:46,579
I'm just too cool.

1115
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:50,099
The "Assassin" is here.

1116
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,419
Can you do it?

1117
00:42:57,939 --> 00:42:59,059
Don't bump into us.

1118
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,139
This is way too hard.

1119
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:08,459
I'll take a picture of this too.

1120
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:11,699
My photo has such a great vibe.

1121
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:13,739
Look at the one I took of Lao Bai.

1122
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,059
Doesn't it look pretty artsy?

1123
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:17,859
Nice.
Let me take one of you too.

1124
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,179
Yeah, I'll snap a candid of you.

1125
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:21,899
Pretend you're...

1126
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:24,459
Okay.
This one of mine...

1127
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:36,739
No.

1128
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,419
How did you grow up?

1129
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,259
You're so good-looking.

1130
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:45,459
This person is actually quite good-looking.

1131
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,659
This person is quite good-looking—what?

1132
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:51,979
Don't laugh.
Right.

1133
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:57,499
You look so elegant.

1134
00:43:57,499 --> 00:43:58,459
How could you be like this?

1135
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:05,619
Hurry up and take the picture of us.

1136
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,139
Dilraba's side profile.

1137
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,499
I'm "crazy."

1138
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:12,579
I'm "crazy."

1139
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:13,179
Where's your foot?

1140
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:15,139
Foot.

1141
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:16,019
I'm the foot.
Then I have to sit here.

1142
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,019
Looks good.

1143
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,459
I want to take a picture.

1144
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:32,219
Can I really take the picture with my foot?

1145
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,059
This theme is called "Jin Jing picking her feet."

1146
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:38,339
No.

1147
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,699
No, this definitely won't work.

1148
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:41,379
Pretend to use your hand.
This way is fine.

1149
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:49,899
"Divine beauty"

1150
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,818
"Divine beauty"

1151
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,298
What is that?

1152
00:44:57,058 --> 00:44:58,859
You really look like a big-time director.

1153
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:01,859
The really impressive kind of director.

1154
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,659
Can you hear us talking?

1155
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,538
Put this next to your ear.

1156
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:08,459
Can you take a picture of me?

1157
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,578
Just take one and you can be done.

1158
00:45:09,578 --> 00:45:10,379
Okay.

1159
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:11,659
Can you squat down a bit?
It's too high.

1160
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,899
It's fine, I want this kind of low-angle shot.

1161
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:16,099
Okay.

1162
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:17,179
You're so tall.

1163
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,739
You're too tall.

1164
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:26,259
Okay.

1165
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:27,459
All right.

1166
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:29,379
Here's a good spot.

1167
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:32,019
Let's change places.

1168
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:32,459
Let's go.
No problem.

1169
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,379
I just took a beautiful photo of you.

1170
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:36,059
Really.

1171
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:43,579
I'm going to "sue" you.

1172
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,179
I'm going to "sue you" studio.

1173
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:46,819
"Sue you"

1174
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,499
Look at what he filmed for me.

1175
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:53,259
I want to "kill someone."
This one.

1176
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,139
Can I get first place?

1177
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:56,779
Yes.
You can.

1178
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:58,979
This buff card has nothing to do with you now.

1179
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,259
I'm definitely going to get a lawyer.

1180
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:10,219
It's not Bai Yu.

1181
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,859
This thing is a bit noisy.

1182
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,539
It keeps following me.

1183
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:16,699
It's really noisy.

1184
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:18,179
There's nothing I can do about it.

1185
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:23,779
Let's go.

1186
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:26,019
Here, this place looks nice.

1187
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:39,579
With the first one,

1188
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:45,739
Big brother is so handsome.

1189
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,299
He seems so relaxed.

1190
00:46:50,299 --> 00:46:51,539
But he's so handsome.

1191
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:52,459
He's really so handsome.

1192
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,219
Bai Yu, what should I do?

1193
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:57,739
Is mine included too?

1194
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,459
Yes.
This is the one, right?

1195
00:46:59,219 --> 00:46:59,979
No.

1196
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:01,139
They're all here.

1197
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,339
It's fine, just walk around randomly.

1198
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,459
I'll find another place to take photos later.

1199
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:06,299
Where should we take the photos?

1200
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:07,099
Here.

1201
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:08,259
Come quickly.

1202
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:11,179
This one.
Let's do it here.

1203
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,379
Coming!

1204
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:16,779
One, two, three.

1205
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,059
Perfect.

1206
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,699
Sponge Little Umbrella.

1207
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:31,819
This umbrella is so pretty.

1208
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,659
Sponge umbrella.

1209
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:34,579
It really looks nice.

1210
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,659
Your clothes look nice too.

1211
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,339
I want to sit on the blue chair too.

1212
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:40,379
Take this white umbrella.

1213
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:42,419
You just have to sit the same as me.

1214
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:43,099
Yes.

1215
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,579
Three, two, one.

1216
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:47,619
Beautiful.

1217
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:52,739
Help me find some animals.

1218
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:55,179
Don't.
Don't go.

1219
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,579
You don't have to be with the animals.

1220
00:47:58,579 --> 00:47:59,539
I want to take a photo with you.
I want to take a picture of you.

1221
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:01,979
You want to take a picture of me.

1222
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,019
No problem, then you take it.

1223
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:06,379
This feels pretty good.

1224
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:06,659
Right?
This watch looks good in the photo.

1225
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:07,859
It was already nice.

1226
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,259
Come on, everyone.

1227
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:10,779
There's something inside.
Hurry up.

1228
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:12,259
Let's go in.

1229
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:14,459
That puppy was here just now.

1230
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,379
Can we go out?

1231
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:16,859
We can't go out, they're not letting us.

1232
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:18,619
Everyone, come back.

1233
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:20,659
Big brother is so bossy.

1234
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:21,979
I really like it.
I'm speechless.

1235
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:25,379
So speechless.

1236
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,379
I think I smell an animal.

1237
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,899
I smell it, but I don't see it.

1238
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,619
Look, what is this place?

1239
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:40,859
Your animal.

1240
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:41,779
That Badi.

1241
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:44,379
Why are you in there?

1242
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:46,059
Come here.

1243
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,299
It's just staying there.

1244
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,019
It's very happy.

1245
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:50,659
Keyu, come take a picture.

1246
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:54,579
So cool.

1247
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,459
Amazing, unbeatable.
Okay.

1248
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,579
I feel like this buff card is mine.

1249
00:48:58,579 --> 00:48:59,139
Sorry about that.

1250
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:00,659
I'm just a buff.

1251
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:02,219
Where did the cat go?

1252
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:04,859
There, I see it.

1253
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:05,339
It's over there.

1254
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:07,419
Hurry!

1255
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:19,819
Over here, come quickly.

1256
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:23,459
Hurry up.

1257
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,499
Alright, this side profile is amazing.

1258
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:34,619
You've been spoiled with comfort.

1259
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:36,539
Feels good, doesn't it?

1260
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:46,539
Your fur is so soft.

1261
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:47,499
Wait a moment.

1262
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:03,579
What are you doing?

1263
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:14,979
Puppy

1264
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,099
Come here.
Come here, be good.

1265
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:21,779
Let's go take a photo.

1266
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:23,459
Puppy

1267
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,219
How do you snore at someone?

1268
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:41,979
Where else are there animals?

1269
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:43,979
Where are all the cats?

1270
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:45,899
Did you find them?

1271
00:50:45,899 --> 00:50:46,979
No.

1272
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,259
There's a cat over there.

1273
00:50:50,779 --> 00:50:51,699
Little cow.

1274
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,099
Okay.

1275
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:56,979
Ning.

1276
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:58,939
There's a fly here.

1277
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,859
Isn't this an animal too?

1278
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,219
I'm not using macro focus, I can't photograph the fly.

1279
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:07,579
It ran away, hurry.

1280
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:08,179
It's fine.

1281
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,179
Hurry, just stand here.

1282
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,579
Just stand here, okay.

1283
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:13,739
Got it.
Handsome.

1284
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:15,059
Cool.
Perfect.

1285
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:20,299
We didn't take a group photo.

1286
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:21,619
Right, we didn't take a group one.

1287
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:23,659
So what about you in the group photo?

1288
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,259
Take a group photo with five people.

1289
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,979
Take a group photo without yourself in it.

1290
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:29,739
Come, sit.

1291
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:31,659
You do look good.

1292
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,619
Smart face, silly stomach.

1293
00:51:36,899 --> 00:51:38,579
Then let's all put our faces together.

1294
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:39,739
That's not a good idea.

1295
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,739
You're obviously happy.

1296
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:44,939
Your ideal distance is
You stretch out your arm

1297
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,459
and touch my fingertips.

1298
00:51:47,459 --> 00:51:48,699
That's the best distance.

1299
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:50,019
Our faces are too big.

1300
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:51,579
Remove the word "our."
Here we go.

1301
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:54,699
One, two, three.

1302
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,179
Got it.

1303
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:01,899
This one's nice.

1304
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:03,019
You guys go, I'll take the photo.

1305
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:05,179
Come on, everyone.

1306
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:06,019
Come on, bro.

1307
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,499
One, two, three.

1308
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:15,699
Three, two, one.

1309
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:18,619
Let's all take a photo with the cow.

1310
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:19,259
How about it?

1311
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:20,659
He Li and Jin Yu are awesome.

1312
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:21,379
That's the idea, come on.

1313
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:22,419
Right.
Last one, last photo.

1314
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,459
Move in a bit.

1315
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:26,179
Otherwise, the cow won't be in the shot.

1316
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:27,939
Okay.
Alright, that's good.

1317
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:29,579
Thanks for your effort.

1318
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,619
Let's go.

1319
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:31,899
Let's go back and hand in our task.

1320
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,619
It's so warm.

1321
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:35,499
They arranged for us to sit by the stove.

1322
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,819
Everyone, from the photos you took,

1323
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:39,979
pick the six you're most satisfied with.

1324
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:40,859
These are the ones.

1325
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:48,019
Look at that manliness.

1326
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:51,019
Check out the veins in his neck.

1327
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:51,939
A real tough guy.

1328
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:54,739
I've definitely won, I've got this.

1329
00:52:55,899 --> 00:52:57,379
I have to say, this photo is really well taken.

1330
00:52:57,379 --> 00:52:58,179
Seriously.
Right?

1331
00:52:58,579 --> 00:52:59,419
It's ready to be published as is.

1332
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,699
This one of Bai Ge's.

1333
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:02,899
A photo with the idol.

1334
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:04,859
This group photo is really nice.

1335
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:08,899
Bai Yu looks like he came to steal corn in this one.

1336
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:11,699
Can't help it, because he had to bring the cat.

1337
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:12,659
He doesn't look like he's stealing corn.

1338
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,379
He looks like an old farmer whose corn got stolen.

1339
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,339
An old farmer whose corn was stolen.

1340
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:20,699
Pick a few.

1341
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:21,539
Pick six.

1342
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:24,099
Each person's solo photo plus the group photo.

1343
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:24,939
Each person's solo.

1344
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:27,059
Can my camera even take solo shots?

1345
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,379
My camera is for you guys.

1346
00:53:29,379 --> 00:53:31,099
Everyone is in the frame.

1347
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:32,299
My camera.

1348
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:33,939
How do you even use this?

1349
00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:40,499
Bro, this is way too realistic.

1350
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:42,339
The machine is really hard to control.

1351
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:43,419
I'm not exactly an expert either.

1352
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:46,179
Old Bai.
He's just framing it.

1353
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,779
No matter how you end up looking in here,

1354
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:50,019
as long as it's you, it's fine.

1355
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:51,579
What are you doing?

1356
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:55,179
Put me on the edge.

1357
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:56,979
Put me on the edge.

1358
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:58,219
You made him look so handsome.

1359
00:53:58,219 --> 00:53:59,619
But how did he make you look?

1360
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:02,299
Okay, this one.
I think it's pretty good.

1361
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:04,379
Will this work?

1362
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:04,939
Dilraba.

1363
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:06,539
I look so wide.

1364
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:07,379
How did he make your...
Double doors.

1365
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:12,939
What's this?
You put it out there.

1366
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:14,939
This is our...

1367
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:16,099
blacklist photo in this industry.

1368
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:16,819
I'm telling you, they're all...

1369
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,579
Really, they're all blacklisted photos.

1370
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:20,339
Director, your directing...

1371
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:22,099
is really hard to manage.

1372
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:23,979
Maybe you should just go back to acting.

1373
00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:24,979
Okay.

1374
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:27,219
You have to use this to look at your photo.

1375
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:31,819
This is way too hard.

1376
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:45,819
It's gone.

1377
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:47,939
Why is it just Jin Jing and me?

1378
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:52,339
It's over.

1379
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:54,939
I'm so touched.

1380
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,099
Not a single one is left.

1381
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,219
Just Jin Jing and me.

1382
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:57,539
And also,
There's one of Reba.

1383
00:54:58,419 --> 00:54:59,219
We're doomed.

1384
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:00,659
Afterwards, it just stayed on standby for too long.

1385
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:01,259
It turned off by itself.

1386
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:02,939
Then when you pressed it again,

1387
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:03,899
you didn't turn on that switch.

1388
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:07,939
It's okay.

1389
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,579
He did it on purpose, sis.

1390
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:13,099
He did it on purpose.

1391
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:15,619
He must have done it on purpose.

1392
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:18,219
He likes it so much.

1393
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:21,339
It's fine.
No.

1394
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,059
Whose do you need now?

1395
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:24,099
Just have someone go take it with you.

1396
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:25,819
Come on.
Let me find an angle.

1397
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,019
Like this, with the prop.

1398
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:33,979
Perfect.

1399
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:35,419
Each one looks better than before now.

1400
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:37,899
Come on, let's take another group photo.

1401
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:38,379
It's over.

1402
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:39,939
We can play stacking blocks.

1403
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:41,299
Come on, let's stack them.

1404
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:45,259
Three, two, one.

1405
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,459
I won! I definitely won.

1406
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:00,379
Ke Yu

1407
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:05,179
Why is this dog not friendly at all?

1408
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:06,179
It's afraid of you.

1409
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,699
It can tell at a glance that you're a "bad person."

1410
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:08,459
Alright.

1411
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,539
He developed it, right?

1412
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:12,259
It's been developed.

1413
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:17,139
Dilraba

1414
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:18,779
Look at yours.

1415
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:21,659
I'm really impressed by this double-door one.

1416
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:25,099
Who took this?
I took this.

1417
00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:28,219
This set really has a vibe.

1418
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,419
This set feels great.

1419
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,659
Yeah, the color tone is really nice too.

1420
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,419
Actually, the last one is the best.

1421
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:34,139
Everyone's expression is just perfect.

1422
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:34,619
Yeah.

1423
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:36,019
This is high-level.

1424
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:37,339
Not bad.

1425
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:39,219
So cute.

1426
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:41,619
What's up with Zhang Linghe here?

1427
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:46,619
I took such a cool photo of you, bro.

1428
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:47,779
I took this.
Smartwatch.

1429
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:49,739
This is the effect with the smartwatch.

1430
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,179
This one.

1431
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:51,779
This one's good.
Not bad.

1432
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:53,219
Right?

1433
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:55,059
Not bad.

1434
00:56:55,699 --> 00:56:56,699
Taken with the little watch.
Pretty good.

1435
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:03,739
Zhou Keyu, your photo looks so pitiful.

1436
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:04,659
Why?

1437
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:06,499
Because the staff voted.

1438
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:08,699
Actually, you can tell from behind the board.

1439
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:09,459
There are votes.

1440
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,539
Because there's no more space.

1441
00:57:11,379 --> 00:57:12,099
But yours,

1442
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,819
not a single one is showing.

1443
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:18,779
Only behind your set of photos,

1444
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:19,939
You're right.

1445
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:21,099
Not a single one is visible.

1446
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:22,259
They're all sticking out, look.

1447
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:24,299
Yeah, ours are all crammed in.

1448
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:30,299
I see it.

1449
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,539
This is good.

1450
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:38,659
Bai, you go first.

1451
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,059
This isn't bad either.

1452
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:58,339
Wait a moment.

1453
00:57:58,939 --> 00:57:59,659
Mr. Bai Yu

1454
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:01,939
Did you submit two photos of me?

1455
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:03,099
Which ones?
Who put in two votes?

1456
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,699
One for this one.

1457
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:06,339
You.
No.

1458
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:08,699
That seems a bit biased, right?

1459
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:10,779
Don't tear it up, just leave it.

1460
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:20,659
Go.
Okay, I'll go vote.

1461
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:25,899
I think all our group photos look great.

1462
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:26,339
Right?

1463
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:27,459
I think so too.

1464
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:29,859
Aren't you going to vote for Bai Ge?

1465
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:30,579
No need to vote for me.

1466
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:31,659
I'm not voting for Bai Ge.

1467
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:33,539
I have to vote for the one I like.

1468
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:33,899
Right.

1469
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,059
Love triangle.

1470
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:39,379
I'm not voting for myself with this one.

1471
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:40,579
I'm voting for Double Door.

1472
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:41,779
She's voting for the fridge.

1473
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:43,459
She's voting for the fridge.

1474
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:45,659
I'm voting for "Dili Rekai."

1475
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,179
Okay.

1476
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:50,499
"Dili Double Door."

1477
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:52,179
This one.
This one looks good.

1478
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:54,259
This one is absolutely beautiful.

1479
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:55,659
I didn't see this one just now.

1480
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:57,179
It can't be changed anymore.

1481
00:58:58,179 --> 00:58:59,299
You can't target us like this.

1482
00:58:59,299 --> 00:58:59,979
Xiao Jin

1483
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:01,779
Let's give him a vote in this group.

1484
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:04,019
That's just a pity vote.

1485
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:05,259
No need.

1486
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:07,019
Vote again if you really like it.

1487
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:08,339
You don't have to do that.

1488
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:08,819
Really?
Vote for the one you like, right?

1489
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,899
Then I really do like this one.

1490
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,299
I'm done voting.
Finished voting.

1491
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:16,099
All done.

1492
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,419
Sorry, little genius.

1493
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:22,659
Definitely the little genius.

1494
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,739
I think we should give some encouragement.

1495
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:25,699
Let's vote for our group photo.

1496
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,099
Because no one can pick a single person.

1497
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:29,019
What's so good about it?

1498
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:30,619
I think this one.

1499
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,539
Jin Jing took a really good photo of me, this one.

1500
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:33,419
I like this one too.
This one is truly amazing.

1501
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:36,299
It's so cinematic.

1502
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:37,499
Yes, very cinematic.

1503
00:59:37,499 --> 00:59:38,659
The one of Bai Yu is also really nice.

1504
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:40,059
This one.

1505
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,259
I don't need a sympathy vote.

1506
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:44,899
It's not a sympathy vote.

1507
00:59:44,899 --> 00:59:46,299
But this one has a real sense of story.

1508
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:46,739
Yes.
Right?

1509
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:48,259
It's very lively.

1510
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:49,659
Just like our everyday life.

1511
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:50,979
This really looks like it was taken on an outing.

1512
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:52,139
Yes, the last one.

1513
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:53,979
I think this one looks good.

1514
00:59:53,979 --> 00:59:54,619
Absolutely beautiful.

1515
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:55,859
This one is truly stunning.

1516
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,459
Put on those little glasses, and the vibe is on point.

1517
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:00,579
But little do they know, the back side is...

1518
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:04,819
I'll cast my vote.

1519
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,019
Looks like her position here...

1520
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,379
means she's voting for the little genius.

1521
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:12,299
Yes, I really like this one.

1522
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:18,459
Why did I end up voting for myself every time?

1523
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:18,859
Wait a second.
It's fine.

1524
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:21,619
This one seems even "uglier" than yours.

1525
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,179
Bai took this photo.
Yeah.

1526
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:24,819
What's this?

1527
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:27,739
I think the double-door one deserves a vote.

1528
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:28,939
I don't want it.

1529
01:00:29,499 --> 01:00:30,699
What is this?

1530
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,099
This one is actually nice.
This one really does look good.

1531
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:34,699
It has a great vibe.

1532
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,619
It's actually pretty even, right?

1533
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:38,139
Yeah.

1534
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:39,979
What should we do?

1535
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:41,259
I still want to vote for myself.

1536
01:00:41,259 --> 01:00:41,779
It's pretty even.

1537
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:43,379
I still have two left.

1538
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,099
Does anyone like this group?
You can pick one.

1539
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,019
Take a look.
This side is pretty good.

1540
01:00:50,899 --> 01:00:51,579
It has a nice vibe.

1541
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:53,579
This one—

1542
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:54,859
Trying to get votes.

1543
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:57,939
How can you recommend yourself?

1544
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,779
Started promoting.

1545
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:00,699
You can vote for this one.

1546
01:01:01,259 --> 01:01:02,219
You can vote for this one.

1547
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,459
You can vote for two as well.

1548
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,299
No, I think it’s like this.

1549
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:06,779
Our group photo—

1550
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:08,219
I think it deserves a vote, really.

1551
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,099
The group one is really worth voting for.
This one—

1552
01:01:11,979 --> 01:01:12,739
Yeah, this one’s good.

1553
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:13,899
And then this photo of Zhang Linghe—

1554
01:01:13,899 --> 01:01:14,659
I think I could vote for it too.

1555
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:15,819
I don’t think Zhang Linghe’s is good.

1556
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:16,819
No, you can’t see the face clearly.

1557
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:18,099
Can’t see the face.
Now he just feels like—

1558
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:20,379
Like a “unicorn monster” or something.

1559
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:23,299
I’ll vote.

1560
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,579
Vote for this one.
Little genius.

1561
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:41,859
Zhou Keyu.

1562
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:44,099
She's a good person.

1563
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:46,899
This one is really good.

1564
01:01:46,899 --> 01:01:47,259
Yeah.
This one is really good.

1565
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:49,579
This one looks nice.

1566
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:52,779
Bai, I really can't find any flaws with yours.

1567
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:55,659
You can open the door.

1568
01:01:56,858 --> 01:01:57,819
One vote for "Fridge".

1569
01:01:57,819 --> 01:02:00,579
My "Fridge" has cast quite a few votes for you.

1570
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:06,898
I'll just stick the rest on.

1571
01:02:06,898 --> 01:02:07,938
I'll stick all the ones with Bai Yu.

1572
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,378
You're sticking them like this.

1573
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:13,898
What's wrong?

1574
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,179
If you want me to win,

1575
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:16,499
then just keep sticking them on me.

1576
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,779
No, I just want everyone to know you're handsome.

1577
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:22,339
Seriously, I'm just hyping "Sha," really.

1578
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:24,219
Can you stick one on yourself?

1579
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,659
Stick one on yourself.

1580
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:28,979
I'm speechless.

1581
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:29,898
I'm speechless.

1582
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:31,299
I'm speechless.

1583
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:33,299
I'm speechless.

1584
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:34,418
Can't help it.

1585
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:37,139
Someone who looks like this is always handsome on camera, right?

1586
01:02:38,139 --> 01:02:40,418
I'm really speechless, I really am.

1587
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:42,779
This season,

1588
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,699
I already feel a huge sense of crisis.

1589
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:49,939
Someone who looks like this is always handsome on camera, right?

1590
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:52,779
Among my choices,

1591
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:53,659
actually, this one is really handsome.

1592
01:02:53,659 --> 01:02:54,699
This one isn't handsome.

1593
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:57,539
Thank you.

1594
01:02:58,179 --> 01:02:59,939
Good taste.

1595
01:02:59,939 --> 01:03:01,979
I really have to say, Zhang Linghe,

1596
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:03,859
you're handsome and have good taste.

1597
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:05,899
Handsome and have good taste.

1598
01:03:05,899 --> 01:03:07,539
I have to vote for this work first.

1599
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,419
Look at this boy.

1600
01:03:12,379 --> 01:03:12,899
Zhang Linghe.
I think you have some conscience.

1601
01:03:13,899 --> 01:03:15,019
You should vote for mine.

1602
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,139
Isn't that good? I filmed it for you.

1603
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:19,539
Then I'll vote for myself too.

1604
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:21,339
Yes, this one is also filmed very well.

1605
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,979
I took this photo of you, you look really cool, don't you think?

1606
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:28,659
Do you know what this one looks like?

1607
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:29,019
What?

1608
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:30,099
Like someone who's eaten too much and is just lounging around.

1609
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:33,539
Look at your carefree attitude.

1610
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:34,619
Very cool.

1611
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,019
Call me something nice.

1612
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:36,539
Young master.

1613
01:03:36,899 --> 01:03:38,659
Young master.

1614
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:39,619
Then I'll vote for a group photo.

1615
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:41,939
Vote for a group photo.

1616
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:43,259
Support the little genius.

1617
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:44,979
Thank you, young master.

1618
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,019
Okay, done voting.

1619
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:46,859
Finished voting.
Success.

1620
01:03:47,459 --> 01:03:48,259
Finished voting.

1621
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:49,419
Settlement.

1622
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:51,699
How many do you think are behind your board?

1623
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:52,579
The ones the staff voted for.

1624
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,779
Not many.

1625
01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:56,059
Just as we guessed.

1626
01:03:57,419 --> 01:03:58,299
Little Genius

1627
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,899
That's fine, actually it's already done.

1628
01:03:59,899 --> 01:04:01,459
The votes have already been counted.

1629
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:01,939
Okay.
Let's take a look first.

1630
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:03,859
The votes among you

1631
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:05,579
Which photo received the most votes?

1632
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:06,499
Okay.

1633
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:10,699
Four photos, two with four votes each.

1634
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:12,459
Congratulations to Zhou Keyu and Zhang Linghe.

1635
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:13,779
for receiving the highest number of votes.

1636
01:04:14,179 --> 01:04:15,219
I made the list!

1637
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,499
That Little Genius one

1638
01:04:17,499 --> 01:04:18,779
was purely sponsored.

1639
01:04:20,419 --> 01:04:20,859
Little Genius

1640
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,019
I think we should give some encouragement.

1641
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:22,619
Let's vote for this one.

1642
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,539
Let's support Little Genius.

1643
01:04:24,899 --> 01:04:25,899
Our friendship is just...

1644
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:27,099
No, how can you say that?

1645
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:29,019
Because honestly, I couldn't pick any others.

1646
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:33,419
The two people with the most votes

1647
01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:34,019
can receive

1648
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:35,539
a bonus card for season three of "Start Reasoning".

1649
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:37,099
Two people.

1650
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:38,939
I'm the other one.

1651
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:42,739
So nervous.

1652
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,059
So nervous.

1653
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:50,979
He doesn't need to be nervous.

1654
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:52,019
It seems like there's nothing much after this.

1655
01:04:58,099 --> 01:04:59,139
Who said I don't have any votes?

1656
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:01,379
Who said I don't have any votes?

1657
01:05:05,499 --> 01:05:06,859
Twenty-four votes.

1658
01:05:08,499 --> 01:05:09,259
Twenty-nine votes.

1659
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:12,779
Ning, go ahead.
You've already posted them all.

1660
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:15,139
Ning probably has quite a few too.

1661
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:16,019
Thirty-three votes.

1662
01:05:18,379 --> 01:05:19,619
Not bad.

1663
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:20,459
Won.

1664
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:26,019
She probably has quite a few too.

1665
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:28,459
Thirty votes.

1666
01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:29,619
Thirty-five votes.

1667
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:35,779
Thirty-eight votes.

1668
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:42,179
No.

1669
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:43,739
Look at this one of you.

1670
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,899
I earned it for you.

1671
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,939
Really.

1672
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:47,539
The importance of a model.

1673
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:48,779
That's true.

1674
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:49,699
Forty-five votes.

1675
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:52,779
Alright, right now we're in first place.

1676
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:54,099
You're first, I'm second.

1677
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:55,379
Let's see if anyone pushes me out.

1678
01:05:55,939 --> 01:05:56,979
There are a lot on Reba's side too.

1679
01:05:56,979 --> 01:05:57,979
It's over, Reba.

1680
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:08,779
It's over, you got squeezed out.

1681
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:13,499
This is a direct win.

1682
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:14,859
No need to watch the rest.

1683
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:16,539
Let me take a look.

1684
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:18,499
What?

1685
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:20,179
I'll reveal it for him.

1686
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:28,659
Fifteen votes is just too miserable.

1687
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:29,579
Fifteen votes.

1688
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:30,979
It's okay, bro, but you're good-looking.

1689
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:31,619
That doesn't matter.

1690
01:06:34,379 --> 01:06:35,099
This one's mine.

1691
01:06:39,899 --> 01:06:40,899
Thirty (votes).

1692
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:42,379
I won.

1693
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,299
Can we get that bonus now?

1694
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:46,699
Yeah.

1695
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:48,219
We've got this, Dilraba.
We've got this.

1696
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:50,859
This season is all about us.

1697
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:59,459
Experts don't win the first three rounds, really.

1698
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:01,219
Experts don't win the first three rounds.

1699
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,339
It's obvious you play games a lot.

1700
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:03,019
Games, right.

1701
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:18,779
Designated Role Card

1702
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:23,619
What is a Designated Role Card?

1703
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:26,179
It assigns a specific character setting to a player.

1704
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,499
For example, assigning someone to be the "madman" in episode N.

1705
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:31,619
Be what?
The "madman."

1706
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:32,259
Play the "madman."
Okay.

1707
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,899
Then you can create a character profile.

1708
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:35,819
Who does he like?

1709
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,179
Things like his background and experiences.

1710
01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:39,739
So the scriptwriter wants us to do it ourselves.

1711
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,499
Alright.

1712
01:07:43,179 --> 01:07:44,339
How would you act as the "madman"?

1713
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:47,179
Bro, that's the "fool."

1714
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:49,659
Xiao Jin.

1715
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,459
Rebound Card.

1716
01:07:54,899 --> 01:07:56,619
If you become X in a certain episode,

1717
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:59,339
you can bounce it to another detective.

1718
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:02,699
Why is hers so good?

1719
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,579
This one is awesome.

1720
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:06,659
This one is really practical.

1721
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:07,579
This is practical.

1722
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:10,139
Okay, can we see the others?

1723
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:12,899
We'll reveal them in the next round.

1724
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:13,979
There's more.
Right.

1725
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:15,259
There are also buffs.

1726
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:17,419
Now I'm excited.

1727
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,299
Come on, let's continue.

1728
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:24,499
Getting excited.

1729
01:08:25,499 --> 01:08:26,739
Listen to my cue.

1730
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:29,379
Players need to draw lots to split into three groups.

1731
01:08:29,379 --> 01:08:30,619
Take turns to do the challenge.

1732
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:33,139
Both people must wear headphones during the challenge.

1733
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:34,259
One person looks at the prompt.

1734
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:36,019
Says what's in the prompt.

1735
01:08:36,019 --> 01:08:37,619
The other person guesses the prompt.

1736
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,099
Whichever group can, within eight minutes,

1737
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:40,139
guess more words

1738
01:08:40,139 --> 01:08:41,259
will be the winning group.

1739
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:42,459
The winning group can draw

1740
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:43,819
a Season 3 bonus card.

1741
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,099
Okay.

1742
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:47,099
Whoever draws me is really lucky.

1743
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:47,739
Come on.

1744
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:51,659
One.
I'm also one.

1745
01:08:53,499 --> 01:08:54,099
Three.
The two of us.

1746
01:08:55,179 --> 01:08:55,979
Alright, let's go.

1747
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:00,259
Hello

1748
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:01,379
I am

1749
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:02,419
Okay
We're sure to win

1750
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,299
Look how lazy he is

1751
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:05,139
Who
You

1752
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:06,619
Me? What did I do?

1753
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:07,819
We're all standing

1754
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:08,899
But you're sitting there eating seeds

1755
01:09:10,419 --> 01:09:11,379
What are you doing

1756
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:12,939
How am I supposed to investigate like this with you

1757
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:14,019
You need to learn to be independent

1758
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:15,739
No way

1759
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:16,939
Xiaowei isn't that kind of person

1760
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:17,939
But you are

1761
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,019
Even though you're lazy

1762
01:09:20,019 --> 01:09:21,379
You like to use your brain

1763
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:26,779
But I'm not good at this kind of game

1764
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:27,859
Then I'll do it, I'll guess

1765
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:28,379
You're guessing, right?

1766
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:29,619
Yes, I'm really good at guessing

1767
01:09:32,259 --> 01:09:33,179
Watch how they play
We can do it

1768
01:09:34,579 --> 01:09:35,579
Let's learn a bit

1769
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:36,899
Now I'm excited

1770
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:37,659
You two are definitely going to lose

1771
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:41,579
No, just kidding

1772
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:42,539
Come on

1773
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:45,979
You act out a few words first

1774
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:47,219
Okay, sure

1775
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,059
Go ahead

1776
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:51,099
I'm really good at guessing

1777
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:52,299
There's no sound

1778
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:57,779
That was way too loud.

1779
01:09:58,779 --> 01:09:59,739
At a loss.

1780
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:01,539
Deaf.

1781
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:04,339
Elderly person.
Wait a moment.

1782
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:05,899
Alzheimer's disease.
I haven't shown him yet.

1783
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:08,299
I haven't shown him yet.

1784
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:10,539
That was just a personal attack.

1785
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,419
What did you say?

1786
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:16,179
Let's check the saltiness first.
What level is it?

1787
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:17,739
Right.

1788
01:10:18,219 --> 01:10:18,979
Let's start.

1789
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:23,139
I'm nearsighted, I can't see.

1790
01:10:34,299 --> 01:10:37,179
Ten characters

1791
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:39,219
By my side

1792
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:39,819
On my side
Absolutely can't

1793
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:41,019
Can't

1794
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:44,339
Without giegie

1795
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:46,659
I can't be without giegie by my side

1796
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,059
I absolutely can't be without

1797
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:51,979
Can't
Absolutely

1798
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:53,739
Is
Absolutely

1799
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:55,419
Let go

1800
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:57,619
By my side

1801
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:04,059
By my side

1802
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:06,979
Absolutely can't

1803
01:11:08,019 --> 01:11:08,779
Without

1804
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,059
They all heard it over there.

1805
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:18,379
Sing a folk song.

1806
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:22,539
Do the movements.

1807
01:11:24,019 --> 01:11:25,019
Move a little.

1808
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:30,019
So tired.

1809
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:34,099
Pass one.

1810
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:38,619
Five characters.

1811
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:42,099
Dilraba.

1812
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,019
A beam of light, one night of darkness.

1813
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:47,299
Follow.

1814
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:48,099
Light.
Take off.

1815
01:11:59,099 --> 01:11:59,859
Mirror

1816
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:04,899
Lighting

1817
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:07,459
Light

1818
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:11,099
A beam of light, then total darkness

1819
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:13,499
Correct

1820
01:12:17,539 --> 01:12:18,219
Five characters

1821
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:21,139
Big brother

1822
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:22,419
Big brother

1823
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:25,579
Six characters

1824
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:25,939
I

1825
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,139
First character: I

1826
01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:28,939
Am not

1827
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:29,979
I am not

1828
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:30,619
Right

1829
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:31,939
He Jiawei

1830
01:12:35,379 --> 01:12:36,899
He Jiawei

1831
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,699
Zhang Linghe, I am not Zhang Linghe

1832
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:41,939
He Jiawei, Jiawei

1833
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:47,179
He Jiawei Qiangwei

1834
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:48,299
Home

1835
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,859
Do the gesture

1836
01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:53,259
How is he supposed to do the gesture?

1837
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:57,059
Jiawei

1838
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,299
Zhang Jiawei, I am not Zhang Jiawei

1839
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:06,059
Zhang Jiawei is the real name

1840
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:15,419
Jiawei

1841
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:17,059
His voice is about to give out soon.

1842
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,659
His voice is hoarse. His voice is already hoarse.

1843
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,379
That can't happen.

1844
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:23,619
The beam of light disappears into the night.

1845
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:25,899
Jiawei

1846
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:35,379
Switch.

1847
01:13:36,339 --> 01:13:37,019
Exchange.

1848
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:45,379
We've only guessed one right so far.

1849
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,419
I think the two of us can do it now.

1850
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:50,539
We're definitely going to win.

1851
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:55,939
The first word is "push".

1852
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,699
Push.

1853
01:13:58,899 --> 01:13:59,579
Push.

1854
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:02,779
The second character is "town".

1855
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,299
Push town.

1856
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:07,219
The last three characters are "nightingale".

1857
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:08,459
Nightingale.

1858
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,379
Push the town's nightingale

1859
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:22,099
Six characters
Six characters.

1860
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:26,259
The first character is "circle".

1861
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:27,299
Circle

1862
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:28,179
The second character

1863
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:29,539
Oil

1864
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,179
Oil

1865
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:36,659
Oil

1866
01:14:43,059 --> 01:14:43,619
Oil

1867
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:47,339
Oil

1868
01:14:49,139 --> 01:14:50,059
Oil

1869
01:14:50,059 --> 01:14:51,299
Round oil

1870
01:14:51,299 --> 01:14:52,539
I still think we need to gesture

1871
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:54,619
The third character is "head"

1872
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:55,579
Round oil head
Right

1873
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,139
The last three characters

1874
01:14:58,139 --> 01:14:58,899
Pig

1875
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:00,979
The sixth character is "pig"

1876
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:02,819
Pig
Right

1877
01:15:04,339 --> 01:15:05,859
The sixth character is "pig"

1878
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:07,299
There's a pig with a round head

1879
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:11,579
Does this make any sense to you?

1880
01:15:12,219 --> 01:15:13,419
There's a pig with a round head

1881
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:16,899
Pick

1882
01:15:16,899 --> 01:15:18,099
Have

1883
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:18,939
Pick head

1884
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,619
Has an owner

1885
01:15:20,619 --> 01:15:22,619
Pick head pig

1886
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:29,259
The fifth character is "oil"

1887
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:33,979
Pick oil

1888
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:35,739
Round oil head

1889
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:38,739
Round oil head picks oil pig

1890
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:41,219
This counts as correct, right?

1891
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:42,779
Actually, it does count as correct

1892
01:15:43,179 --> 01:15:44,219
Round oil head picks oil

1893
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:54,499
Huge challenge

1894
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,019
This huge challenge is just too difficult.

1895
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,659
Round oil head picks oil pig

1896
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:04,419
I can't be without giegie by my side

1897
01:16:04,419 --> 01:16:06,139
The beam goes dark overnight

1898
01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:07,339
Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its owner

1899
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:09,179
It's all us here
Words once said in "Let's Start Reasoning"

1900
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:12,379
Let's do it
Come on

1901
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:14,339
You go
I'll go

1902
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:26,739
Master, you can go eat now.

1903
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:32,339
Master.

1904
01:16:35,059 --> 01:16:35,619
Master.

1905
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:38,779
Master.

1906
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:44,859
Master

1907
01:16:48,379 --> 01:16:49,259
Master

1908
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:52,099
Master

1909
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:55,299
You

1910
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:56,299
Master, you

1911
01:16:58,259 --> 01:16:59,459
can

1912
01:16:59,459 --> 01:16:59,939
It's all us who are

1913
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:01,139
Things said in "Let's Start Reasoning"

1914
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:05,899
Master, you can go eat now

1915
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:08,379
So impressive

1916
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:10,899
This one is so simple

1917
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:11,979
Yeah, ours is really hard

1918
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:12,899
Do you know why?
Why?

1919
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,259
Because of your beard

1920
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,099
It affects the shape of your mouth

1921
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:22,779
Master

1922
01:17:27,339 --> 01:17:27,979
Master

1923
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:29,739
Please

1924
01:17:30,419 --> 01:17:31,739
Master, please

1925
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:33,859
Feel free to give your orders

1926
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:36,459
Master, please feel free to give your orders

1927
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:37,139
Yes

1928
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:39,499
We've already taught them how to play

1929
01:17:39,499 --> 01:17:39,979
Really

1930
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:42,579
You

1931
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,499
Are my X

1932
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:47,779
You are my X

1933
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:49,499
How many are they with now

1934
01:17:50,059 --> 01:17:50,619
Three
Also three

1935
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:52,899
I

1936
01:17:53,379 --> 01:17:54,619
Want

1937
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:55,459
I want

1938
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:57,659
"Kill"

1939
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,619
If I want to "kill," I just "kill."

1940
01:17:59,619 --> 01:18:00,339
Correct.

1941
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:01,499
More than us.

1942
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:04,899
Let him fall from his pedestal.

1943
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:07,339
This one.

1944
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:10,459
Let him.

1945
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:12,819
Let him.

1946
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,139
Let him.

1947
01:18:17,299 --> 01:18:19,019
Perform.

1948
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:20,859
Body movement.

1949
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:22,339
What?

1950
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:25,539
Body movement.

1951
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,379
Feels like the two of them will be like this when they're old.

1952
01:18:28,379 --> 01:18:29,179
What did you say?

1953
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,139
Let him.

1954
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:33,419
Hurt him.

1955
01:18:36,099 --> 01:18:38,659
Fall.

1956
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:41,019
Fall in love.

1957
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,339
Pedestal.

1958
01:18:45,259 --> 01:18:46,539
This is right. I think this is right.

1959
01:18:46,819 --> 01:18:47,579
This one, really.
He.

1960
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:50,099
Fall.

1961
01:18:54,299 --> 01:18:55,059
Fall.

1962
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:01,539
Dad

1963
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,579
This is the person

1964
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:05,739
Dad

1965
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:06,379
Fall

1966
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:08,419
It's not me

1967
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:09,699
No, no need

1968
01:19:10,139 --> 01:19:10,779
Fall

1969
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,219
You fall

1970
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:25,899
Pass

1971
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:29,899

Thin

1973
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:34,619

01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:49,659
Thick

1984
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:56,099
Sudden leg removal

1985
01:19:57,779 --> 01:19:58,819
Leg, off, protrude

1986
01:19:59,019 --> 01:20:00,699
Four characters

1987
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:01,499
Correct
The first character

1988
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:07,779
Thin

1989
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:09,299

Push

1993

1995
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:32,219

1996
01:20:36,379 --> 01:20:37,099
Public

1997
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:40,579

Passed

2000
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:49,099
It's already impressive that you've held on until now.

2001
01:20:51,419 --> 01:20:52,339
Hurry up and say it.

2002
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:54,139
Just point to him and it's over.

2003
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:55,419
You

2004
01:20:55,419 --> 01:20:55,979
I
You can

2005
01:20:58,099 --> 01:20:59,179
Hold on

2006
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:00,099
Long

2007
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:03,899
Hold on

2008
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:07,499
Hold on

2009
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:13,659
It's already impressive that you've made it this far.

2010
01:21:16,299 --> 01:21:17,739
They actually have more than us.

2011
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:18,419
They have four.

2012
01:21:18,419 --> 01:21:19,539
They have more than you.

2013
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:20,459
You have to win.

2014
01:21:21,059 --> 01:21:21,819
I'll do it.

2015
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:24,659
Victory is certain.

2016
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:26,699
Watch how they play.
We can do it.

2017
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:28,179
Let's learn from them.

2018
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:31,419
If we don't guess it right, we skip, right?

2019
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,899
Pass.

2020
01:21:32,899 --> 01:21:34,659
The sixth word is "pig."

2021
01:21:34,659 --> 01:21:35,979
Who's acting and who's guessing?

2022
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:37,099
Either is fine, you choose.

2023
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:38,099
I'll act first.
Okay.

2024
01:21:38,379 --> 01:21:39,379
If we can't guess it,
then we'll switch.

2025
01:21:40,099 --> 01:21:40,459
Alright.

2026
01:21:41,139 --> 01:21:41,899
Victory is certain.

2027
01:21:45,219 --> 01:21:53,339
The Demon King is speechless.

2028
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:55,459
The Demon King is speechless.

2029
01:21:55,459 --> 01:21:57,779
Turn her into me.

2030
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,339
You saw it wrong.

2031
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:03,219
You saw it wrong.

2032
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:05,539
Turn her into me.

2033
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,419
Expose me.

2034
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,619
The Demon King is speechless.

2035
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:11,979
Turn her into me.

2036
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:12,699
Turn her into you.

2037
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:13,739
That's not right.

2038
01:22:15,019 --> 01:22:15,379
No.
The Demon King is speechless.

2039
01:22:16,179 --> 01:22:18,299
Goose, no, goose.

2040
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:22,379
So speechless.

2041
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:29,619
Turn her into a goose

2042
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:31,259
Goose

2043
01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:34,459
The Demon King, speechless, turned her into a goose

2044
01:22:35,339 --> 01:22:36,179
Goose

2045
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:41,779
Princess

2046
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:43,379
Princess

2047
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:46,619
Princess

2048
01:22:47,099 --> 01:22:47,979
Please
Princess, please

2049
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,059
Come in

2050
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:55,259
Princess, please open the door

2051
01:22:56,699 --> 01:22:57,779
The princess can still open the door.

2052
01:22:57,779 --> 01:22:59,219
The princess even opens the door for you.

2053
01:23:03,699 --> 01:23:04,339
Enter the door

2054
01:23:05,139 --> 01:23:06,019
Enter the door

2055
01:23:06,019 --> 01:23:07,059
Princess, please enter

2056
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:10,539
It's over

2057
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,019
Feels dangerous

2058
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:14,139
Anywhere

2059
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:15,579
Snowy ground

2060
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:17,379
Big

2061
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:18,459
Big

2062
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:19,779
Jump

2063
01:23:21,299 --> 01:23:23,179
Big

2064
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:23,739
Small

2065
01:23:24,339 --> 01:23:24,859
Small

2066
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:25,939
Small

2067
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:29,459
Thin

2068
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:31,179
Thick
Big

2069
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:33,339
Small
Thick

2070
01:23:33,939 --> 01:23:34,619
Big
Thin

2071
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:36,419
Small
Watch how they play.

2072
01:23:37,339 --> 01:23:37,939
We can
learn from them.

2073
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:42,899
Big

2074
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:43,819
Small

2075
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:45,699
Big, small, small

2076
01:23:48,059 --> 01:23:48,899
Eye

2077
01:23:49,659 --> 01:23:50,859
Perform big and small anywhere

2078
01:23:53,139 --> 01:23:54,619
So impressive

2079
01:23:56,339 --> 01:23:57,259
Getting excited.

2080
01:23:57,979 --> 01:23:58,659
Getting excited.

2081
01:24:01,179 --> 01:24:02,579
God.

2082
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:03,459
Perspective.

2083
01:24:04,179 --> 01:24:05,059
God's perspective.

2084
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:09,259
Young Marshal.

2085
01:24:10,419 --> 01:24:11,499
101.

2086
01:24:11,499 --> 01:24:12,459
Young Marshal 101.

2087
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,179
Let me take another look.

2088
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:18,739
Handcuffs.

2089
01:24:19,419 --> 01:24:21,179
These handcuffs are my personal hobby.

2090
01:24:23,019 --> 01:24:24,219
So impressive.

2091
01:24:24,219 --> 01:24:24,979
It's over.

2092
01:24:24,979 --> 01:24:26,059
Done.

2093
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:27,619
These handcuffs.

2094
01:24:27,619 --> 01:24:28,939
By the way.

2095
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:30,379
Right?

2096
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:35,819
Mind Sniper.

2097
01:24:36,059 --> 01:24:37,299
Mind Sniper.

2098
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:41,419
I hit you.

2099
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:47,859
Mind.

2100
01:24:50,739 --> 01:24:53,499
Mind.

2101
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:56,059
Mind.

2102
01:24:57,219 --> 01:24:58,059
Sniper

2103
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:01,099
Sniper

2104
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:03,539
Mind Sniper

2105
01:25:07,299 --> 01:25:08,859
Okay

2106
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:13,419
It seems like it's a people problem

2107
01:25:13,419 --> 01:25:14,739
It's my problem, I admit it

2108
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:16,899
This whole season I will

2109
01:25:16,899 --> 01:25:17,779
reflect on my own issues

2110
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,019
I'll be watching your performance

2111
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:19,619
Alright

2112
01:25:20,139 --> 01:25:22,139
You with me

2113
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:22,939
With me

2114
01:25:23,299 --> 01:25:24,899
Here

2115
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:25,819
Step with me

2116
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:28,739
Let's be together

2117
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:29,979
Be with me

2118
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,099
Moo

2119
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:34,179
With

2120
01:25:36,019 --> 01:25:36,819
Moo

2121
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:38,939
With me here

2122
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:40,539
Be with the cow

2123
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:45,779
Be with me, moo

2124
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,099
Amazing

2125
01:25:49,099 --> 01:25:50,299
You guys are amazing

2126
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:54,539
Great

2127
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:55,939
The winners of this round are

2128
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:57,619
Dilraba and Liu Yuning

2129
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,579
You can draw a power-up card

2130
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:06,459
I don't want to lose again, Bai Yu.

2131
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:10,139
My throat hurts so much.

2132
01:26:11,139 --> 01:26:12,019
It's starting.

2133
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:14,819
Come on.

2134
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:17,659
Choose someone.
Why is it this again?

2135
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:20,819
Right, you have two chances to choose now.

2136
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:22,899
Okay.

2137
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:25,419
Could I be the reverse X?

2138
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:30,539
Double Points Card

2139
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,099
Penalty Doubled

2140
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:38,059
Designate one round for your own Golden Key (double points)

2141
01:26:40,099 --> 01:26:41,979
So in one round, I can get two

2142
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,059
How is it this good?

2143
01:26:44,059 --> 01:26:44,339
Like this

2144
01:26:44,339 --> 01:26:45,899
If you win, you can get two

2145
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:47,739
If you lose, you get nothing, right?

2146
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:48,939
I use it in whichever round I win

2147
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:49,179
Right

2148
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:50,659
There's no way I won't win even once in ten rounds, right?

2149
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:52,219
Before the round starts

2150
01:26:54,499 --> 01:26:55,499
It's fine

2151
01:26:56,179 --> 01:26:57,219
Next up is our

2152
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:59,139
final round of the power-up card challenge

2153
01:26:59,139 --> 01:26:59,859
Great

2154
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,059
Catch Me Card

2155
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:05,619
Each player needs to have

2156
01:27:05,619 --> 01:27:07,259
fifteen balloons tied to their back

2157
01:27:07,259 --> 01:27:09,579
Each balloon contains a word card

2158
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:10,619
Players can

2159
01:27:10,619 --> 01:27:11,859
pop the balloons on others' backs

2160
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,499
to collect word cards

2161
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:14,379
The first to collect

2162
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:16,619
the first two to complete "He Li Mo Jin Yu"

2163
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:18,539
You can get a Season 3 power-up card.

2164
01:27:19,259 --> 01:27:20,779
This is the first time I've heard your voice sound hoarse.

2165
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:21,859
It's hoarse.

2166
01:27:23,059 --> 01:27:24,099
It's a battle round, right?

2167
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:27,179
Who should we "take out" first?

2168
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:30,499
Now I'm pumped.

2169
01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:31,339
Try to tie it a bit higher.

2170
01:27:31,339 --> 01:27:32,379
Even if you tie it around my neck, it's fine.

2171
01:27:32,379 --> 01:27:34,139
My balloon is way too low.

2172
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,739
We can't even reach the tall ones.

2173
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:40,699
Pulling the string is still okay.

2174
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:42,459
Give me a chance to pull the string.

2175
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,939
So, are we forming an alliance or not?

2176
01:27:46,339 --> 01:27:47,059
Alliance or not?

2177
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:48,099
How do we form an alliance?

2178
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:49,379
I'll do the first "kamikaze" attack.

2179
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:51,539
I'll just grab his balloon and pull it down.

2180
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:53,059
Then you pop his balloon.

2181
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:54,499
But if you draw a good card,

2182
01:27:54,499 --> 01:27:55,819
you have to share it with me.

2183
01:27:55,819 --> 01:27:56,659
How about it?

2184
01:27:58,019 --> 01:27:58,339
Okay.

2185
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:00,219
She's trying to stir things up between us.

2186
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:01,259
Just this little thing.

2187
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:02,939
She wants to benefit while we fight each other.

2188
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:05,259
Ready.

2189
01:28:05,659 --> 01:28:06,539
I'm so nervous.

2190
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:12,419
Start

2191
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:26,299
I found it.

2192
01:28:32,299 --> 01:28:32,899
You want to

2193
01:28:33,459 --> 01:28:34,179
You want to run

2194
01:29:00,699 --> 01:29:01,899
No, that's not true.

2195
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:02,419
You can't do that.

2196
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:03,499
You can't do that.

2197
01:29:04,459 --> 01:29:04,979
Give it a try.

2198
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:09,059
I'm really scared of popping balloons.

2199
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:09,779
I feel the same way.

2200
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:19,859
Why can't I pop it?
Use more force.

2201
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:33,499
Yu
Jin

2202
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:36,499
No, no
How could that be?

2203
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:41,659
Yu

2204
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:51,019
Touch.

2205
01:29:53,259 --> 01:29:54,339
Why are there so many Yu everywhere?

2206
01:29:57,379 --> 01:29:58,699
It's tangled.

2207
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:03,659
Let's touch each other.

2208
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:04,339
That's not okay.
I'll give you one.

2209
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:18,339
He

2210
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:32,579
He Li, Mo, Jin, Yu

2211
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:35,299
They're all here.

2212
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:39,779
I managed to pick up four.

2213
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:44,179
I managed to pick up four.

2214
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:56,499
Yu

2215
01:30:56,499 --> 01:30:57,619
They're all Yu.

2216
01:30:58,099 --> 01:30:59,339
There's no Li.

2217
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:12,339
That's you.

2218
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:15,579
You.

2219
01:31:16,499 --> 01:31:16,939
For you.

2220
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:19,579
Yu.

2221
01:31:33,059 --> 01:31:33,779
So tired.

2222
01:31:34,099 --> 01:31:34,619
So tired.

2223
01:31:37,179 --> 01:31:37,819
Alright.

2224
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:40,939
He.

2225
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:42,299
Li.

2226
01:31:44,139 --> 01:31:44,699
Mo.

2227
01:31:45,379 --> 01:31:45,819
Jin.
Yu.

2228
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:51,219
Game over.

2229
01:31:52,019 --> 01:31:52,499
I'm "dead" tired.

2230
01:31:58,699 --> 01:31:59,179
Pull it for me.

2231
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:00,779
Here you go.

2232
01:32:06,419 --> 01:32:07,259
I made it myself.

2233
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:17,539
I'm "dead" tired.

2234
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,819
The one who just got the buff card is

2235
01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:23,419
Zhang Linghe.
Bai Yu.

2236
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:27,539
How about it?

2237
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:29,059
As long as we're not on the same team,

2238
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:31,819
Come on, Bai Yu.

2239
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:44,299
Double vote card
Your vote counts as two votes

2240
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:49,179
This kind of card can't fall into his hands

2241
01:32:49,179 --> 01:32:50,339
It's over

2242
01:32:50,339 --> 01:32:52,019
We're really finished

2243
01:32:52,019 --> 01:32:53,299
This one is the most useful

2244
01:32:53,299 --> 01:32:54,499
It was given to the most clueless one

2245
01:32:55,499 --> 01:32:56,259
It's over

2246
01:32:56,259 --> 01:32:57,339
He has decided this game

2247
01:32:57,339 --> 01:32:58,819
The outcome of this round is set

2248
01:33:07,779 --> 01:33:08,419
What card?

2249
01:33:08,419 --> 01:33:09,539
The card to steal from you.

2250
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:12,059
Designate a person.

2251
01:33:12,059 --> 01:33:13,979
You can take their current golden key.

2252
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:15,379
Steal it.

2253
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:16,939
If he wins,
If he

2254
01:33:17,499 --> 01:33:18,419
doubles it,

2255
01:33:18,419 --> 01:33:19,979
then I can steal two from him.

2256
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:23,059
Beat you.
Right?

2257
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:24,699
Then don't use that card anymore.
I won't use it for the rest of my life.

2258
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:31,819
He's the only one who doesn't have one.

2259
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:33,379
Our little brother.

2260
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:34,819
I'm the only one who doesn't have one.

2261
01:33:35,779 --> 01:33:36,459
How about this?

2262
01:33:37,939 --> 01:33:39,659
If you put on a performance, I'll let you draw one.

2263
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:40,899
No, I don't want to anymore.

2264
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:46,179
Congratulations, everyone.

2265
01:33:46,179 --> 01:33:48,419
You've completed all the challenges for the bonus cards.

2266
01:33:48,419 --> 01:33:50,899
Now we can order dishes for our dinner.

2267
01:33:52,099 --> 01:33:52,939
Order dishes to eat tonight.
Come on.

2268
01:33:57,699 --> 01:33:58,499
It's different.

2269
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:03,059
Mine is a refreshing appetizer.

2270
01:34:03,379 --> 01:34:04,459
Each person gets to choose a dish.

2271
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:09,259
Scallion oil poached chicken, big plate chicken, spicy chicken.

2272
01:34:09,259 --> 01:34:10,819
Sweet and sour chicken, chicken with mushrooms.

2273
01:34:10,819 --> 01:34:12,939
Chicken stewed with mushrooms, instant noodle hot pot chicken.

2274
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:14,259
Instant noodle hot pot (chicken).

2275
01:34:14,259 --> 01:34:15,819
Instant noodle hot pot chicken sounds good.

2276
01:34:15,819 --> 01:34:17,299
Sounds delicious.

2277
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:18,099
Instant noodle hot pot chicken.

2278
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:19,419
How about pickled fish?
Okay.

2279
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:20,779
Let's have some chicken soup.
Alright.

2280
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:22,059
Then let's have shredded three delicacies.

2281
01:34:22,059 --> 01:34:23,419
Spicy chopped chili beef.

2282
01:34:23,419 --> 01:34:24,299
How about spicy and sour shredded potatoes?
Okay.

2283
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:25,059
Sure.

2284
01:34:25,499 --> 01:34:27,539
Alright, then let's get ready to serve the dishes.

2285
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:29,739
Really?

2286
01:34:30,419 --> 01:34:31,459
Are we eating now?

2287
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:33,819
I don't think it's that simple.

2288
01:34:33,819 --> 01:34:34,779
There's no way we're eating here.
Serve the dishes.

2289
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:44,979
Let's take a look at the six dishes everyone ordered.

2290
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:51,499
So delicious.

2291
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:52,939
It smells so good.

2292
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:53,579
Voucher
Okay

2293
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:55,099
You can also give us vouchers.

2294
01:34:55,659 --> 01:34:56,659
We can use them whenever we want to eat.

2295
01:34:59,379 --> 01:35:00,179
There’s something written on the back.

2296
01:35:02,059 --> 01:35:03,099
What, we have to make it ourselves?

2297
01:35:04,179 --> 01:35:05,459
We really have to make it ourselves.

2298
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:06,779
You ordered the dishes yourselves.

2299
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:07,859
Do it yourself

2300
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:10,019
Then my shredded salad will be amazing

2301
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:10,499
So amazing
It's done

2302
01:35:13,219 --> 01:35:14,139
So next

2303
01:35:14,139 --> 01:35:16,459
everyone needs to go to the market to buy groceries

2304
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:18,379
The navigation address

2305
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,899
is written on the back of this phone

2306
01:35:21,259 --> 01:35:23,819
Let's start shopping

2307
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:24,539
Let's go

2308
01:35:25,499 --> 01:35:26,859
Are we driving ourselves?

2309
01:35:26,859 --> 01:35:27,659
Borrow the car, let's go borrow the car.

2310
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:32,899
Old Lin.

2311
01:35:33,579 --> 01:35:34,139
Old Lin.
Master Lin.

2312
01:35:35,099 --> 01:35:35,539
What's up?
We need to go buy groceries.

2313
01:35:36,339 --> 01:35:38,819
Can we borrow your car?

2314
01:35:38,819 --> 01:35:39,659
You're going to buy groceries, right?

2315
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:40,739
Yes.

2316
01:35:40,739 --> 01:35:41,739
How many of you are there?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2317
01:35:42,419 --> 01:35:43,139
Six people.

2318
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:44,819
Alright, then use my car.

2319
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:45,219
Okay.
Here are the car keys.

2320
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:47,859
Alright.

2321
01:35:47,859 --> 01:35:49,579
It's parked in the yard by the entrance.

2322
01:35:49,579 --> 01:35:49,899
Okay.

2323
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:51,459
Where is the market?

2324
01:35:51,939 --> 01:35:53,219
It's called Lijia.

2325
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:54,019
Okay.
Then let's go buy groceries first.

2326
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:55,379
Alright.

2327
01:35:55,379 --> 01:35:56,499
Remember to drive it back.

2328
01:35:56,499 --> 01:35:57,499
I still need the car tonight.

2329
01:35:57,499 --> 01:35:58,699
Okay.

2330
01:35:58,699 --> 01:35:59,419
Don't worry, Master Lin.
We'll return the car to you.

2331
01:36:03,698 --> 01:36:04,979
Come on, driver.

2332
01:36:05,779 --> 01:36:06,219
Alright.

2333
01:36:06,498 --> 01:36:07,739
Driver.

2334
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:10,339
Did you take the menu?

2335
01:36:10,339 --> 01:36:10,819
Got it.
Good, just bring it together.

2336
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:13,739
Let's not forget to buy that ingredient later.

2337
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:14,498
Give everything to him.
I'll be in charge of keeping it.

2338
01:36:15,459 --> 01:36:16,099
You're in charge of keeping it.
Alright, okay.

2339
01:36:16,578 --> 01:36:17,739
Because you're the most reliable.

2340
01:36:19,059 --> 01:36:19,698
You're reliable, that's right.

2341
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:25,779
I'm taking the front seat, everyone.

2342
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:26,739
We'll sit in the back.

2343
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:32,538
Let's go.

2344
01:36:35,299 --> 01:36:36,899
These people have been tired all day.

2345
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:37,819
It's so funny.

2346
01:37:01,179 --> 01:37:02,099
Come on, I'll take you.

2347
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:03,538
Home.

2348
01:37:04,059 --> 01:37:04,739
Going home?

2349
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:06,419
If not, I'll just force it back.

2350
01:37:06,419 --> 01:37:07,498
Just push it straight back.

2351
01:37:09,459 --> 01:37:09,819
I think

2352
01:37:09,819 --> 01:37:11,538
we can just record our push like this.

2353
01:37:11,538 --> 01:37:12,219
I think so too.

2354
01:37:12,219 --> 01:37:13,259
Why investigate cases?

2355
01:37:13,259 --> 01:37:15,379
Let's just cook and chat every day.

2356
01:37:15,379 --> 01:37:16,538
Anyway, we have Liu Yuning here, right?

2357
01:37:16,538 --> 01:37:17,339
Right.

2358
01:37:18,019 --> 01:37:18,538
What do you mean by that?

2359
01:37:18,538 --> 01:37:19,779
Then let's start cooking.

2360
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:20,618
Let's start cooking.
Let's start living.

2361
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:21,819
Let's start cooking.

2362
01:37:28,379 --> 01:37:29,859
Vegetable and agricultural products distribution center

2363
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:31,419
This is it

2364
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:33,419
Yes, the agricultural products distribution center

2365
01:37:33,419 --> 01:37:34,498
You need to raise the barrier, right?

2366
01:37:36,459 --> 01:37:37,219
Wait a moment

2367
01:37:40,979 --> 01:37:41,739
Hello

2368
01:37:41,739 --> 01:37:43,299
Are you here to park?

2369
01:37:43,299 --> 01:37:43,899
Yes, to park
That's right

2370
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:51,459
Manual barrier lift

2371
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:52,299
Manual

2372
01:37:52,899 --> 01:37:53,899
Come

2373
01:37:53,899 --> 01:37:55,299
Pull over and stop

2374
01:37:55,299 --> 01:37:55,939
What does that mean?
Pull over

2375
01:37:56,659 --> 01:37:57,539
Move to the side
So should I stop here?

2376
01:37:58,379 --> 01:37:58,819
Just pull over and stop, right

2377
01:37:58,819 --> 01:38:00,419
Okay, that's fine

2378
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,539
I can't understand what he's saying.

2379
01:38:03,139 --> 01:38:04,139
Alright, everyone.

2380
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:05,459
Arrived safely.

2381
01:38:05,459 --> 01:38:06,379
You have deviated from the route.

2382
01:38:06,379 --> 01:38:08,019
Why is this phone moving on its own, bro?

2383
01:38:08,419 --> 01:38:10,379
Please reconfirm your destination.

2384
01:38:10,379 --> 01:38:11,059
Please take a detour.
What does this mean?

2385
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:13,699
You have deviated from the route.

2386
01:38:13,699 --> 01:38:14,939
The road has disappeared.

2387
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:16,859
Please reconfirm your destination.

2388
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:17,899
Please take a detour.

2389
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:19,779
You have deviated from the route.

2390
01:38:20,219 --> 01:38:21,339
The road has disappeared.

2391
01:38:21,339 --> 01:38:23,339
Please reconfirm your destination.

2392
01:38:23,339 --> 01:38:24,059
Please take a detour.

2393
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:26,259
You have deviated from the route.

2394
01:38:26,259 --> 01:38:27,819
This might be part of it.

2395
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:28,659
Please reconfirm your destination.

2396
01:38:28,659 --> 01:38:29,979
Is the phone broken?

2397
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:30,939
No.

2398
01:38:31,419 --> 01:38:32,739
You have deviated from the route.

2399
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:34,499
The road has disappeared.

2400
01:38:34,499 --> 01:38:35,059
Please reconfirm your destination.

2401
01:38:35,059 --> 01:38:36,939
Someone is using it, someone is filming.

2402
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:38,859
No, it's just stuck.

2403
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:40,259
It's not stuck, just exit out.

2404
01:38:41,139 --> 01:38:42,619
Route has been reconfirmed.

2405
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:44,539
Resuming normal operation.

2406
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:48,059
Turn it off, hurry, turn it off.

2407
01:38:48,739 --> 01:38:49,819
It's fine, just leave it like this for now.

2408
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:50,619
Don't worry about it.

2409
01:38:51,379 --> 01:38:51,979
Don't worry about it.

2410
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:54,339
When we get out of the car later, let's act a bit more dramatic.

2411
01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:57,539
Like, maybe tugging at our clothes or something.

2412
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:01,419
Let's go down one by one.
Then line up and walk forward.

2413
01:39:02,339 --> 01:39:03,779
Okay, that's fine.

2414
01:39:03,779 --> 01:39:05,259
That's fine.

2415
01:39:05,259 --> 01:39:06,259
Let me design it for you.

2416
01:39:06,259 --> 01:39:07,819
When you go down, hold this like this.

2417
01:39:10,419 --> 01:39:10,779
And you,

2418
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:13,979
You pull this open and take a look.

2419
01:39:15,219 --> 01:39:17,699
Why do you have so many entrance poses like this?

2420
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:18,099
This one.

2421
01:39:18,099 --> 01:39:19,259
He's really good at this.

2422
01:39:20,019 --> 01:39:20,339
Okay.

2423
01:39:21,059 --> 01:39:21,939
Alright, three, two, one, go.

2424
01:39:46,699 --> 01:39:47,379
No need to wait for this one.
It's fine, close the door.

2425
01:39:48,139 --> 01:39:49,419
Aren't you going to support this?

2426
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:50,859
Give it some support.

2427
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:51,499
Alright.

2428
01:39:54,459 --> 01:39:55,979
Why is there so much smoke?

2429
01:39:59,499 --> 01:40:00,099
What's wrong?

2430
01:40:00,539 --> 01:40:01,379
What's the problem?
I don't know.

2431
01:40:08,139 --> 01:40:09,019
What do you mean?
It's nothing.

2432
01:40:09,619 --> 01:40:10,939
Come on, let's walk the red carpet.

2433
01:40:12,019 --> 01:40:12,459
Alright.
Come on, let's go.

2434
01:40:36,339 --> 01:40:37,819
Hello, welcome.

2435
01:40:37,819 --> 01:40:38,699
Welcome, hello.
Hello.

2436
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:46,019
I'm happy to be here shopping for groceries today.

2437
01:40:46,019 --> 01:40:47,099
I'm glad to be here today.

2438
01:40:48,379 --> 01:40:48,739
Buying some groceries.

2439
01:40:48,739 --> 01:40:49,859
Even giving a speech.

2440
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:53,219
Come on, let's each do our own thing first.

2441
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:53,819
Don't forget.
Okay.

2442
01:40:57,619 --> 01:40:57,979
Chicken

2443
01:40:59,859 --> 01:41:02,059
Chicken—it's amazing how you packed this yourself.

2444
01:41:04,339 --> 01:41:04,819
Chestnuts

2445
01:41:05,579 --> 01:41:05,939
Red dates
Let's get some

2446
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:08,979
Where's the beef?

2447
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:09,419
Beef

2448
01:41:10,179 --> 01:41:10,659
Beef

2449
01:41:11,539 --> 01:41:12,339
Then let's get a bit more

2450
01:41:13,339 --> 01:41:13,859
Chopped chili sauce

2451
01:41:14,979 --> 01:41:15,739
Pickled chili

2452
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:17,539
Cucumber

2453
01:41:17,539 --> 01:41:18,979
Bean sprouts

2454
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:19,539
Let's get this one
I'm done shopping

2455
01:41:20,859 --> 01:41:21,979
The chicken is here

2456
01:41:21,979 --> 01:41:22,739
Sichuan peppercorns, dried chili peppers

2457
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:25,939
Instant noodles, hot pot base, and fermented bean paste

2458
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:32,979
I'm done shopping.

2459
01:41:33,699 --> 01:41:34,299
Pickled vegetables.

2460
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:37,859
What about my fish, guys?

2461
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:38,459
There's no fish.

2462
01:41:40,059 --> 01:41:40,699
Then what should we do?

2463
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:42,699
Who drew the fish again?

2464
01:41:42,699 --> 01:41:44,139
I only have fish.

2465
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:45,979
We'll catch the fish when we get back.

2466
01:41:45,979 --> 01:41:46,459
Okay.

2467
01:41:48,299 --> 01:41:49,139
Let's pay together.

2468
01:41:49,419 --> 01:41:50,419
Thank you, boss.
Driver, please go start the car first.

2469
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:52,219
Okay, I'll go start the car.

2470
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:53,059
Sure.
Here, don't let the girl carry it.

2471
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:54,299
Thanks.
I'll do it.

2472
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:55,419
Goodbye.

2473
01:41:59,179 --> 01:41:59,939
The car is gone.

2474
01:42:03,579 --> 01:42:04,499
Where's the car?

2475
01:42:16,659 --> 01:42:19,419
Boss, hands in his pockets again.

2476
01:42:20,739 --> 01:42:21,419
Hello.

2477
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:22,539
Where's our car?

2478
01:42:23,099 --> 01:42:23,939
What car?

2479
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:28,059
We just parked our car here.

2480
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,899
I didn't see you drive over.

2481
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:31,539
You just walked over here.

2482
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:32,379
What?
He said he's been standing here the whole time.

2483
01:42:33,379 --> 01:42:34,619
He didn't see us come over.

2484
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:40,619
You must have made a mistake.

2485
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:41,819
You walked here.

2486
01:42:48,299 --> 01:42:49,579
We all have cameras.

2487
01:42:49,579 --> 01:42:50,779
Pull up the footage.

2488
01:42:55,259 --> 01:42:56,019
You must be mistaken.

2489
01:42:56,019 --> 01:42:57,379
You walked here.

2490
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,139
Police.

2491
01:42:59,739 --> 01:43:01,299
You walked here.

2492
01:43:01,299 --> 01:43:02,979
Police.

2493
01:43:03,899 --> 01:43:04,899
Help!

2494
01:43:04,899 --> 01:43:06,059
Police.

2495
01:43:07,099 --> 01:43:08,739
There really isn't.

2496
01:43:08,739 --> 01:43:11,299
Then what do we do? What about our car?

2497
01:43:11,299 --> 01:43:12,499
I don't know about that.

2498
01:43:12,499 --> 01:43:14,379
You don't know?

2499
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:26,099
Wait, where did I just put the car keys?

2500
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,299
Where are the car keys?

2501
01:43:28,299 --> 01:43:28,779
I have them.
Come on, press it. Come on.

2502
01:43:32,419 --> 01:43:33,139
Go check the back.

2503
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:41,179
No.

2504
01:43:43,779 --> 01:43:45,099
Has it already entered a loop?

2505
01:43:49,059 --> 01:43:50,419
Have you seen us before?

2506
01:43:50,419 --> 01:43:51,379
People who have seen us

2507
01:43:51,379 --> 01:43:53,099
will forget us in ten minutes.

2508
01:43:53,099 --> 01:43:54,779
Are we stuck in a loop?

2509
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:55,499
There's no car.

2510
01:43:55,499 --> 01:43:56,699
We can only walk back.

2511
01:43:56,699 --> 01:43:57,579
Seriously?
This car,

2512
01:43:58,819 --> 01:43:59,659
is so cool.

2513
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:00,819
Alright.
Let's start cooking.

2514
01:44:05,419 --> 01:44:05,779
Done "killing".

2515
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:07,179
The way you chop vegetables is so clumsy.

2516
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:07,539
Feels like

2517
01:44:07,539 --> 01:44:08,659
I'm about to drool.

2518
01:44:09,139 --> 01:44:10,219
I'm honestly a bit speechless.

2519
01:44:11,259 --> 01:44:12,739
What about my fish, guys?

2520
01:44:12,739 --> 01:44:13,459
Go fishing.

2521
01:44:13,459 --> 01:44:14,539
Take the mountain path.

2522
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:15,699
This mountain villa of yours

2523
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:17,139
Why is there so much smoke?

2524
01:44:17,139 --> 01:44:17,699
Be careful.

2525
01:44:20,859 --> 01:44:21,939
I think it might fall out.

2526
01:44:21,939 --> 01:44:22,939
That's something really scary.
Don't scare me.

2527
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:25,339
What's this?

2528
01:44:25,339 --> 01:44:26,179
It's a box.

2529
01:44:26,179 --> 01:44:27,299
Isn't that a human head?

2530
01:44:27,299 --> 01:44:27,939
It's not.

2531
01:44:27,939 --> 01:44:29,859
Has someone been "killed" here?

2532
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:31,299
There's someone.
Go catch him!

2533
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:33,019
Hurry!

2534
01:44:33,899 --> 01:44:34,539
Who's here?
Swinging on the swing.

2535
01:44:35,379 --> 01:44:36,379
Who is Lao Mu?

2536
01:44:36,379 --> 01:44:37,419
Isn't he called Lao Lin?

2537
01:44:37,419 --> 01:44:38,219
Everyone's changed, right?
The boss has changed too.

2538
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:39,779
Two identities.
It's been refreshed.

2539
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:41,579
Everyone's changed, right?
The boss has changed too.

2540
01:44:42,299 --> 01:44:43,139
Two identities.
Two spaces.
