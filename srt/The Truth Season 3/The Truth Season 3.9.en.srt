00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,880
February 25, 2025

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,520
With the death of Tan Qian,

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,880
the truth hidden behind the Tuitian Confectionery Factory

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,120
finally came to light.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,240
This seemingly harmless candy factory

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,560
was actually a place filled with hidden dangers,

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,120
serving as a livestreaming base.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,760
After finding the real culprit

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,040
who killed Tan Qian,

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,880
An Wenche, who had appeared flustered that morning,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
showed up at the factory again.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
He returned to the factory.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,120
He claimed to have invested a large sum of money in the candy factory

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,680
and said he knew nothing about Tan Qian's death.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,960
He announced

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,440
that he would take over the full operation of the factory

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,240
and immediately end all livestreams.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,280
Everyone could only accept the reality for now.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,840
That night,

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,280
everything seemed to return to normal.

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,000
The six of them went back to the dormitory and slept as usual.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
But none of them expected

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
When they woke up the next day

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,840
they found themselves tied up

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,960
in the main hall of the second-floor streaming room

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,480
The factory's front and back doors were completely sealed

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,120
cutting off any hope of escape

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
The six of them worked together to find a way out

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,920
Three, two, one
Kick

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Who is this

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,360
But in the second-floor stairwell

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
they discovered An Wenzhe's body

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,200
He

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
died from electrocution

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
collapsed near the circuit breaker

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,280
The truth was once again shrouded in mystery

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
An Wenzhe's death

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
was carefully orchestrated by someone

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Murder

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
The killer must be among us

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
It's definitely not the two of us

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Right

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Because we were both tied up here since yesterday

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
After an initial investigation

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,360
the people involved in this case have been identified

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's search him first to see if he has anything on him

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,960
Does he want

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,360
this?

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,440
And this is his

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Hurry up
Get the stuff

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,320
We have to

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,680
take this
out

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,880
I want to ask

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
can you bring those

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
up here for us

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,320
so we can put them together up here

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,880
Sure

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,920
Hurry up, hurry up

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,640
What

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
What is this?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
As the detective for this case,

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
I will remember

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,560
whoever I catch lying, I'll immediately identify as the culprit.

64
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
We need more evidence.

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Now, one by one,

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
we'll search the rooms of you suspects.

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,760
Let's go.

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
Because he said he was scared,

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,320
but he changed into such a nice suit.

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Who could, in a state of extreme fear,

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
still iron a suit and change into it?

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
And even dye their hair a bit red?

73
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,520
What time did you go?

74
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,960
Who are you? I'm the one questioning here.

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,440
And who are you?

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Alright, stop joking around.

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,160
So many murders have happened,

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
and you're still joking and laughing.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
Everyone, sit down properly.

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,120
Did I say you could stand?

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
It feels like we're at a boarding school,

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
getting scolded by the teacher after dinner.

83
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,480
"Innocent" is written all over my face.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
I have an idea.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's leave someone here.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,120
If you want to stay, just say so.

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
No, I think this way has a higher chance of success.

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,960
Then you stay here.
I'm going to look.

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,880
No matter how hard it is, I have to find them.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,880
You go look. You go first.

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
I just got out.

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
You're a man, you go out and run.

93
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
Ning, I can be a woman.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Right now, I...

95
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Bai Hanzi, I've never liked you.

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,840
Explain yourself.

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
This is
lit

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
missing

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,480
That one was torn off

100
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,360
I just wanted to say something.
He just said that I

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
am a very evil person.

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
But I just feel

103
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,000
very

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
And I want to say something.

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
You tricked us, the ignorant ones,

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,400
And you,

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,160
I am

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
also advertising to us.

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,680
Just to get those two

110
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
cheap skins worth a few bucks,

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,080
And you,

112
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
did so many bad things.

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,880
Without you,

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
no one would have lost their families.

115
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
No one would have lost so much money at home.

116
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
I can't get a word in anymore.

117
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
If I catch anyone lying, I'll immediately lock in the culprit.

118
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't bite your tongue, speak more slowly.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Lock in the culprit right away.

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
I've already given birth.

121
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Go out and take good care of my son.

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
We're working to earn money to support your child.

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,840
Is that what you mean?
It's up to you now.

124
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Okay.

125
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
It's obvious the culprit heard this.

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
They learned about the plan.
Then, when we woke up,

127
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
he was pretending too.

128
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Actually, he wasn't.

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
At first, he wasn't familiar with us.

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
But he

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
decided that we were

132
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
so he decided to kill us.

133
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Right.

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
Deep down, he actually hates this.

135
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes.

136
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah.

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
Alright, the case is solved.

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,120
Be careful.

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Impressive, that's some strength.

140
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
Pull-ups.

141
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,520
I only met this guy for the first time yesterday.

142
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
You don't know him.

143
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
That day he ran, and you didn't stop him.

144
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,520
Right.

145
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Wait, what kind of logic is that, man?

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
When I noticed it,

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,920
I only untied myself.

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
That's a stretch, now everyone's starting to dance.

149
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,680
There's only one person's story left untold.

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
I really don't have a story.

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm just an ordinary person.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,280
When I came in, I thought

153
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,000
I just wanted to make a living.

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,520
We won't need to

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
have one person carry another up, right?

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
But everyone's wet, how can we carry each other?

157
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
We can have Bai and He

158
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
pull you up.

159
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
Then we'll support you from below.

160
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
And it has to be the two of us.

161
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Because we're both tall.

162
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
Today's game is

163
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,520
Quick-fire balance questions

164
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
Please stand on a

165
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
fully opened newspaper to answer the questions

166
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,080
You have fifty seconds to think about each question

167
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
Read it again

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,040
What?
Read it again

169
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,320
You have twenty seconds to think about each question.

170
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
If you run out of time, it's considered a wrong answer.

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
For each wrong answer,

172
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
the newspaper must be folded in half once.

173
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
When you can no longer stand on the newspaper,

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
the quiz ends.

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
The challenge fails immediately.

176
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,240
If you answer ten questions correctly within three minutes,

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,400
you succeed in the challenge.

178
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,600
Understood.

179
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Please guess which player this is based on the partial image.

180
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,960
Whose else have I seen?

181
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,320
Zhou Keyu.

182
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,040
Liu Yuning

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,640
I haven't folded yet.

184
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,960
Then you fold twice.
Fold twice.

185
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
Please look at the following photos

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
and identify which one is Bai Yu.

187
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
How would I know?

188
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
I wasn't part of their childhood.

189
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
How am I supposed to know which one is Bai Yu?

190
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,200
A

191
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,600
Please speak.

192
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,360
Who is this?

193
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
May I ask who this is?

194
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
I really can't tell.

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,320
Is this Bai Yu?

196
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,160
This is—who is this?

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Liu Yuning.

198
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
This is Liu Yuning.

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,880
Encyclopedia.

200
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
How would I know what the encyclopedia says?

201
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,960
One hundred eighty-nine (centimeters).
Correct, that's the right answer.

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Really?
Yes.

203
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
That's too much.
Zhang Linghe

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,000
Correct answer.

205
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,640
Which one is not Dilraba?
That's cheating, C.

206
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,840
I can't even recognize myself in this.

207
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
I can't see.
Help me a bit (bring it closer).

208
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,040
C

209
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
Liu Yuning
Correct answer.

210
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,760
Will I...

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,480
...get too many questions right?

212
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,360
Excuse me, at this moment...
Zhou Keyu said...

213
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,720
No, what did the canary say?

214
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,880
Zhou Keyu, you have this hobby?

215
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,120
Wrong.

216
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
What is this?

217
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
So perverted.
Wrong.

218
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,880
So dirty.

219
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Lost.

220
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Which player is this?

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,800
Dilraba

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,160
Wrong

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
Liu Yuning

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Wrong

225
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,920
A

226
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
Okay, correct

227
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,880
Because that photo is the oldest

228
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,040
This is Liu Yuning, right?

229
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes

230
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
Baike's height is

231
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
One hundred eighty-nine (centimeters)

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Correct

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
This is Zhang Linghe

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Let me think.

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
If it's A or B,

236
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
it should be...

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,400
C

238
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
Correct.

239
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Please find it among the following AI-generated children's photos.

240
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,440
It's made using Jin Jing's AI image.

241
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,880
C is generated by AI.

242
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Please sing a line.

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
of the song sung by Ba Zimei in "Tui E Lake".

244
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Wrong.

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,200
Please say which player is shown below.

246
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
Zhang

247
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
Zhang Linghe

248
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm nearsighted, I can't see clearly.

249
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,360
Please use the partial image

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,000
to guess which player this is.

251
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,840
For me,

252
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
what is he wearing around his neck?

253
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I can't see any of it.

254
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,520
Bring it over here.
Just give it to me.

255
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
Let me take a closer look.

256
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,480
Zhou Keyu

257
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Announce the answer
Bai Yu

258
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
That's really interesting

259
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,280
Tell us whose photo this is

260
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,840
and which player's childhood photo it is.

261
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,400
Ning

262
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Wrong
Wrong again

263
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Zhou Keyu

264
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Fold it again

265
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
This is really fun.

266
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Figure out which one is Bai Yu.

267
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
Are you kidding me?

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,720
It must be A.

269
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
Correct.

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Congratulations.
I'm really impressed.

271
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,360
It seems like someone is starting to go easy.

272
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Please state the name of the player in the picture below.

273
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,760
And the player's height according to the encyclopedia.

274
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
Who is this?
Ning.

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
One meter ninety.

276
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,760
The correct answer is 189 centimeters.

277
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,680
Okay.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,920
How would I know his height?

279
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
I can only rely on my own feeling.

280
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,760
I can't stand anymore, I lost.

281
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
Challenge failed.

282
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay.

283
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
Whose collarbone is this?

284
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,800
Zhou Keyu.

285
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
He also has this kind of...

286
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
...exaggerated moment?

287
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Okay.

288
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Whose childhood photo is this?

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,280
This is obviously Zhou Keyu.

290
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,760
Right.

291
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Which one is Bai Yu?

292
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Bottom right, D.

293
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,320
Wrong.

294
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,720
Alright, go ahead.

295
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
This is me.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
Liu Yuning.
Yes.

297
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
Let me take a look myself.

298
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Height is 189 centimeters.

299
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,720
Please use the facial features below

300
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,800
to guess which player it is.

301
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,520
This one.

302
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Zhang Linghe.
Yes.

303
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,640
His mole is quite noticeable.

304
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
Among the following photos,

305
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
find the one who is not Dilraba.

306
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
Top right, B.

307
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,480
Wrong.
Wrong.

308
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,320
Okay.

309
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,200
Wait a moment.

310
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Getting older, my balance isn't as good.

311
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Alright, come on, hurry.

312
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,000
"SuperStar"

313
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Eleven

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
Whose hand is this?

315
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
This is obviously my hand, right?

316
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Wrong.

317
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
I give up, I can't stand anymore.

318
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,400
Just say I lost.
I can't do this anymore.

319
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,000
Alright, thank you.

320
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,280
Which one is Bai Yu?

321
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,360
A.

322
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Correct.
You can tell it's from a different era.

323
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
This childhood photo.

324
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Zhou Keyu.
One meter eighty-eight.

325
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,840
Wrong.

326
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Which one is not Dilraba?

327
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,680
A

328
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,560
Wrong, it's C.

329
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Just take a wild guess—B.

330
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,680
That's not right.
Pick C.

331
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,480
This is—

332
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,040
I don't know.

333
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
I don't really understand songs.

334
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,440
No.

335
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,680
Alright, then it's a failure.

336
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Liu Yuning

337
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,200
Zhou Keyu

338
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,880
This one's a bit hard.

339
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,200
D

340
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Incorrect answer.

341
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,360
This is Liu Yuning, right?

342
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
Liu Yuning is probably

343
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,880
one hundred eighty-nine (centimeters).
Correct answer.

344
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,680
It's not Dilraba.

345
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,600
C

346
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:38,920
A

347
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,120
You used to like playing this.

348
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, pretty much.
Yes.

349
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
You like playing this game.

350
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,280
You like playing this game, right.

351
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
Please look at the following picture.

352
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Name the song that was being performed at that time.

353
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,760
"Let's Watch the Meteor Shower Together"

354
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,040
That's not correct.

355
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
Time's up.
Alright, you failed.

356
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,680
Failed.

357
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
And you forgot to fold it.

358
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Teachers.
I'm done, right?

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Come on, let's take a look.

360
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,320
This is...

361
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,240
Alright, everyone.

362
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Please say whose hand is in the picture.

363
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
This collarbone...

364
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
You have to watch him every day.

365
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,000
Only by looking like this can you guess who it is.

366
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
And this one.

367
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,480
Whose childhood photo is this?

368
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
Please answer the following brain teaser.

369
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,360
The white balloon hit the black balloon.

370
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,320
What should the black balloon do?

371
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Pop.

372
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,520
Confession Balloon.
