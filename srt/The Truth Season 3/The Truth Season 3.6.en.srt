1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,200
This game

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,840
has failed.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,240
The real culprit is

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,800
Bafentang.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,200
Next, let's have Bafentang announce

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,120
whether there is an X this round.

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,200
I am the culprit in this case, Bafentang.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,400
Actually, when I went to Tan Qian's office,

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,560
besides confirming that he was my enemy,

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,760
I also discovered a big secret.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,480
There was actually a hidden room in his office.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,600
The screens in the hidden room were monitoring in real time

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
every move of all the workers in the factory.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,080
I never expected that the place where we work

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,320
would have so many hidden cameras.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
And the backgrounds of some camera angles

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,920
were constantly changing.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
He really has the worst taste.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,840
At this moment, I realized the factory's green walls

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
were actually meant

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
to make it easier to change backgrounds online.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,120
All of us

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,520
were being recorded by hidden cameras.

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,400
We became unwitting protagonists.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,120
The information in the secret room showed

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,360
that on the 25th of every month, from 6:30 to 8:00,

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,240
the factory's hidden cameras would be shut down for inspection.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Luckily, I saw this information.

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,440
Otherwise, if I had rashly killed Tan Qian,

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,200
the whole crime would have been recorded by the cameras.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,720
Now I want to take revenge.

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,600
Besides hiding it from the people in the factory,

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,440
I also have to avoid being caught by the hidden cameras

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,560
recording the entire process.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,960
At the same time, I also found his phone's manual.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,560
His phone actually has two systems.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
By entering different passwords,

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
you can access different systems.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,000
Maybe I can use this to my advantage.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Back at the dormitory

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
I started thinking about how to commit murder

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,240
Suddenly, I realized the 25th is coming soon

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,440
I could do it during the shutdown inspection

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
and commit the crime within that hour and a half

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
To prevent anyone at the factory

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
from suspecting me

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,960
I could use chroma keying

48
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,120
and the access control machine

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,240
to create an impossible crime method

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Once, while I was packing candies,

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,880
I accidentally cut my hand on a candy wrapper.

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,760
My blood got onto the wrapper.

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,240
That piece of candy fell into the pile.

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,400
I couldn't find it.

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
But a few days later,

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
I found that the candy with my blood on it

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,320
was brought back to me by the conveyor belt.

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,800
I secretly started investigating.

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,160
I discovered that every time the candies were packed and loaded onto a truck,

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
they were never shipped out.

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,720
Instead, the truck was driven to the back door of the factory.

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,880
The packed candies would be unpacked again.

63
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Then they would be sent back to my work area by the conveyor belt.

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,520
In other words, the candies I packed every day

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
were always the same batch.

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
I also noticed that around seven o'clock every day,

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
Tan Qian would go alone through the back door's food delivery window

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,240
to pick up breakfast and take it upstairs to the second floor.

69
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
But the door to the second floor

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
can only be opened with Tan Qian's fingerprint.

71
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,160
I can't go upstairs.

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
As for why the factory does this,

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
or what exactly is on the second floor,

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,240
I have no idea.

75
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
But now,

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
the back door, the conveyor belt,

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,600
and Tan Qian opening the delivery window around seven,

78
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
these pieces of information

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
can all be used by me.

80
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,120
Jin Tangshao delivers the prepared breakfast

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
just before seven every day

82
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,480
to the dormitory of our workshop workers.

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,240
After delivering the meals,

84
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
she always goes back to her room to catch up on sleep.

85
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,440
From my observation, after she returns to her room to rest,

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,600
no one else shows up in the cafeteria.

87
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,520
If I hurry to the food delivery window in the cafeteria

88
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
just before seven o'clock,

89
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,320
and spray Tan Qian unconscious on the other side of the window,

90
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
then move him into the cafeteria through the window,

91
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,760
and use the second system on Tan Qian's phone to download

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,920
a video recording app that can change the green screen background,

93
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,560
a video recording app,

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
I can use the green walls of the cafeteria

95
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
to disguise it as the workshop hall.

96
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,280
I can fake him

97
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
dying in the workshop hall at seven o'clock.

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
All factory cameras are down for maintenance.

99
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,520
Filming has stopped.

100
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Golden Spoon delivered the meal as promised, and I opened the door to receive it.

101
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
I heard Jin Tangshao at the door.

102
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
After he returned to his own break room,

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,520
I quietly slipped out to the cafeteria's dish delivery area.

104
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
Facing Tan Qian on the other side,

105
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,480
I sprayed "strong sleep spray" at him.

106
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
He collapsed immediately.

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
I carried him from the back door into the cafeteria.

108
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
At 6:59,

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,520
I stood in front of the green wall in the cafeteria.

110
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
I arranged several boxes.

111
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
I set it up to look just like the workshop hall.

112
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
Then I placed Tan Qian in front of the boxes.

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
I put on a black robe.

114
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,560
Using Tan Qian's phone,

115
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,280
with the second system I had installed,

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,640
I opened a video app that could change the green screen background.

117
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,920
I imported a previously taken

118
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,600
photo of the workshop hall.

119
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,480
At 7:00, I placed the phone inside a tissue box.

120
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
I adjusted the camera angle.

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,960
I opened the app with the background already changed

122
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,040
and started recording.

123
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,000
I took the work wrench I had prepared in advance.

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
I walked toward the unconscious Tan Qian.

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,640
I struck his skull hard.

126
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,360
Then I walked back to where the phone was placed.

127
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,079
I pressed the stop recording button.

128
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
I checked the video.

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,080
It looked like it was filmed in the workshop hall.

130
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,360
There were no flaws.

131
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,520
Satisfied, I

132
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,800
imported the video into the photo album of the phone's first system.

133
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,960
I confirmed the recording time was exactly 7:00.

134
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,280
It hadn't changed due to switching systems.

135
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
After I restored the cafeteria,

136
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,320
I dragged the body from the food delivery hatch to the back door,

137
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
then used the conveyor belt at the back door

138
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
to transfer the body to the workshop,

139
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,840
placing it under some clutter covered with a dust cloth.

140
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,200
I also put the phone and the wrench

141
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
near the body.

142
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,840
At 7:08, I finished dealing with the fog and the black robe.

143
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Then I returned to the cafeteria the same way via the conveyor belt,

144
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
and quickly went back to my own room.

145
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
The phone video shows

146
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,720
that at exactly 7:00,

147
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Tan Qian was killed in the workshop hall.

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,480
According to the access records,

149
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
it was impossible for me to enter the workshop hall.

150
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,960
Even if the back door was discovered,

151
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,240
it takes over three minutes for the conveyor belt to make one trip.

152
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Jin Tangshao can testify

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
that I got my breakfast at 6:57.

154
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,160
It's impossible in such a short time

155
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
for me to go to the workshop hall.

156
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
So I can clear myself of suspicion.

157
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,280
This episode's X's Test

158
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Food factory, tofu shop

159
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,760
Candy store

160
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,120
Detective agency

161
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,240
So we have to guess

162
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,160
How many people are in here

163
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
There are none in here

164
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
That means there can't be anyone in the candy store

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
No one

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,760
So there are six detectives in total

167
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,400
So it's like this.

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,520
Wait, the people don't seem right.

169
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
The people drawn are three girls.

170
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,280
And two boys.

171
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,520
There are six people in total.

172
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
If we count by the number of people,

173
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
not considering this drawing,

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,280
there should actually be one person here.

175
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
But because of this drawing,

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
the little cartoon characters

177
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
don't seem to have anything to do with us.

178
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,200
So it probably has nothing to do with us.

179
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,520
One person is dead.

180
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,200
No, that's not right. But there must be someone in this room.

181
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
Right. So how many people are there in total?

182
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
At the moment, we can see five people.

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
If it's related to us,

184
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
and has nothing to do with the artists here,

185
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,200
then the people in this food factory

186
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,880
are unknown.

187
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
So, is it related to this character?

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
If it is related to the character,

189
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,200
Tofu shop

190
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,960
There are three people in the character "fu" here.

191
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,440
"Fu" (the character)

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
The "fu" with the single person radical.

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Then, the "rou" (meat) part below has two people.

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
So there are three people in total.
So this is three people.

195
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,600
And then, for this detective agency,

196
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
the character "zhen" (detect).

197
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
It has a single person radical.

198
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
And below in the "zhen" character,

199
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
there is a person inside.

200
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,680
So this is two people.

201
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
And the candy shop doesn't have any.

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,880
Any radical that includes the "person" component

203
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
or just "person"

204
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,520
As for the food factory, there's only one

205
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,280
The character for "food" has "person" on top

206
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,000
So there's one person at the food factory

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
Three people at the tofu shop

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Two people at the detective agency
One person at the food factory

209
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,960
Congratulations, you got it right

210
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you

211
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,280
We can make a choice

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
Which detective do you want to turn evil?

213
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,120
Bai Hanzi and Ning Dengpao

214
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,960
I want to choose Bai Hanzi as my

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,520
X

216
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
Because he has that

217
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,800
He has that "(two votes) card"

218
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,360
So he can vote for two people

219
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,120
This round, his vote counts as two

220
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
He decides the outcome of this game

221
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,880
He determines who wins this round

222
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
He can help me

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
First, he helps me

224
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,600
And he can vote for two people

225
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,400
So it's like having three people who can

226
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
help me win this round

227
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,120
So I choose Bai Hanzi

228
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,360
What does "darken X" mean?

229
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,320
What does "darken" mean?

230
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,240
How do you "darken"?

231
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,600
For example, if I'm the culprit,

232
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,320
and you two are detectives,

233
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,200
I say, "No need for X today, I'll handle it myself."

234
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
Now you don't have to choose.

235
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,480
But she’ll definitely choose, because she already did.

236
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,080
The chances of winning are high.
One more vote.

237
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,200
Not necessarily.

238
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
If it’s the golden spoon,

239
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
I believe she wouldn’t choose it.

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,720
Because she really understands variety show effects.

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,960
I won’t choose, what do you mean I won’t choose?

242
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Not choosing X.

243
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,680
You’re being really sneaky.

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
I don’t know if I understand variety shows or not.

245
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
But you really understand me.

246
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,520
The romance plot comes later, just wait a bit.

247
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Isn't this just like before?

248
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,720
Nothing has changed, right?

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
There's one difference though.
You can only communicate once now.

250
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Before, during voting—just as an example—

251
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,760
Say, you’re the killer and I’m X.

252
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
We’d have two votes together.

253
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
(After the rule update) Before voting,

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,080
you don’t know who I’m voting for.

255
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
And I don’t know who you’re voting for.

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
So it’s possible that both of us

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,920
Can’t coordinate.

258
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,840
Can’t coordinate two votes.

259
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,240
So you have to do it during real-life discussions.

260
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,920
Coordinate the votes then.

261
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
You can only do it in real-life conversations.

262
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Coordinate votes in real life.
For example, you’re the killer.

263
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,640
You know I’m X.

264
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,520
I say, I’m telling you, it’s him.

265
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,960
It’s him.

266
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Vote for him.

267
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Then the two of us might end up framing him.

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Just as an example, that’s what I mean.

269
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,520
I'll tell you who the killer is.

270
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm an honest detective.

271
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Turning me evil is pointless.
Even if I turn evil,

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
I will still fight for my

273
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,120
sense of justice.

274
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Driven by my sense of justice,

275
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
I will fight for justice.

276
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
So that's how it is.

277
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
Who among you picked him?

278
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
He immediately asked who picked me just now.

279
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Who was it just now?

280
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
He would just end the game right away.

281
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,720
That's the kind of person he is.
He's that kind of person.

282
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
He wouldn't be like that.

283
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Confirmed X.

284
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Let's see if you are X.

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
I'll relax my facial muscles first.

286
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,960
It's been a long time since I went through this.

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
You can tell as soon as you come in.

288
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,200
Come on.

289
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Wait, he's already changed.

290
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,640
Last season.

291
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,400
He came in without any change.

292
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,960
What?

293
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,640
Last season, when you first came in,

294
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
there was a bit of a change in your expression.

295
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
When you were chosen as X last season,

296
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
you came in very angry.

297
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,920
You came in like this.
I still remember.

298
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,720
Such a strong killing intent.

299
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
I remember.

300
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,320
This must be drawing the X card.

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
He had quite a reaction.

302
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Here he comes.

303
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,520
Why are you copying me?

304
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,440
Do I look that angry?

305
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,680
You were like this last year too.

306
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,280
Really?
It was the same last year.

307
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
So you’re X.

308
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,040
I’m not.

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,400
I’m not, I’m not X.

310
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,080
I’m definitely not, it must be Bai Hanzi who’s X.

311
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Our way of playing today
I actually think it’s normal.

312
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
For example, if I ask you if you’re the culprit,

313
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,800
and you say “I am,” I’d think that’s it.

314
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,400
That’s strange.
Very strange.

315
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,480
I am.

316
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,560
What do you mean?

317
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,080
Normally, the usual way to play is

318
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,560
you have to tell the truth.

319
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
If you really aren’t, just say “I’m not.”

320
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
You’re in a really good state right now.

321
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,800
I feel like you’re in a good mood.

322
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
Why is it that as soon as I say you’re in a good mood,

323
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,120
you immediately show

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
a mischievous smile?

325
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
Secretly, secretly making a heart gesture.

326
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,280
Rubbing hands like a fly.
A fly.

327
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,720
No, why did Bai Hanzi act so quickly?

328
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,960
Because he's not X.

329
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
I feel like he's more like X.

330
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,080
Go ahead.
Didn't you just say

331
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,680
you wanted to be a righteous person?

332
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,440
Didn't you just say
you wanted to be a righteous person?

333
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
That's right, it's me.

334
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
I think he's X.

335
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
I think everyone will tell the truth.

336
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Because when people can't lie,

337
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
they'll tell the truth.

338
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,280
Right.

339
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,800
He came in and said, "I'm not X."

340
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,600
You came in and said,
"It's me."

341
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
So that's the truth.

342
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
If you are X,

343
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,240
I probably know who the culprit is.

344
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm not.

345
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,240
Why are you siding with him?

346
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,920
Are you talking about me?

347
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,920
Has he started talking more?

348
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
Yeah, he has started talking more.

349
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,680
Okay.
Right.

350
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,760
Alright, fine.

351
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Okay, got it.

352
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
There's nothing we can do about it.

353
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,920
Say a bit more, talk more.

354
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,880
I don't want to talk.
I was just observing.

355
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
I was just watching this thing.

356
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Are you using two votes today?

357
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,280
I am.
I said it from the start.

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm using them today.
I said he's X.

359
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,200
He still hasn't refuted me.

360
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,680
I haven't refuted anyone.

361
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,840
No, he should have said something.

362
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,880
Stop pretending, you are, or something like that.

363
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,000
I said I am.

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,640
And after I said I am,

365
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,440
she immediately started siding with you.

366
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
She echoed you and started talking about me.

367
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,200
She should explain to us.

368
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
But she is...

369
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,480
She kept looking at you while talking.

370
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
That's what I just saw.

371
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,120
Okay.

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
Very forceful.

373
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,160
They always say he bullies others.

374
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Today, let's
give him a taste of his own medicine.

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Okay.

376
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,720
That's actually pretty interesting.
Do you know who I am?

377
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,040
Isn't the name right here?

378
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,880
We can't get along too well.

379
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
She said the motive for murder

380
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,560
was just as strong as hers.

381
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,880
As for the motive,

382
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,400
Should we set up a code word to change the tickets?

383
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,840
Let's go back.

384
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,680
Then X will communicate with the killer.

385
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
You really care about X and the killer.

386
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
Of course, I care too.

387
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,880
What are you talking about?
Just saying.

388
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,720
Because of Bai Hanzi.

389
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,680
You're definitely not helping the good guys by doing this.

390
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,120
Why?

391
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,520
Because you keep assuming you're X.

392
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,120
That's not right.
Then...

393
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
If you're not, then you're not. If you are, just say it.

394
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,800
Do you know that?

395
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,720
Why do you care? I just like to say it.

396
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,120
What did you just ask me?

397
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
You asked if I wanted to expose myself.

398
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,000
I...
Yes.

399
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,360
Look at me carefully.

400
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
Do you think I'm the culprit?

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,160
Yes.

402
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
Now you're just making wild accusations.

403
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,880
Then it must be you, Heniba.

404
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
I think you've really grown up.

405
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,520
Because you got the culprit.

406
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,560
And you still dare to look me in the eye like this.

407
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,520
You even started this staring contest.

408
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't use tricks like this to confuse others.

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Confuse who?

410
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,440
Confuse everyone around us.

411
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,800
Do you think anyone here would believe what I say?

412
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,120
I believe you.

413
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,440
I believe you.

414
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,320
You believe me?

415
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,760
You believe I'm not the culprit?

416
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,400
So right now,

417
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
who do you think the culprit is?

418
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,640
Why do you care who I think it is?

419
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
You're the detective.

420
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,280
You're supposed to lead us, but you're still over there.

421
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,840
Mind your own business.

422
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,400
Who do you think the culprit is right now?

423
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
Honestly, I have no idea.

424
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,480
I really can't tell.

425
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,560
Yeah, because even the method of the crime—

426
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,200
I still haven't figured it out.

427
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,080
I tried to think about it just now, but I couldn't work it out.

428
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,480
I want to ask—

429
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
Does X know who the culprit is now?

430
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,080
Yes.
They know.

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:03,960
Yes.

432
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,520
At the same time as X,

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,160
he already knew who it was.
Of course he knows.

434
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
How could he not know?

435
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,000
6:57, right?

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,920
6:58.

437
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,079
At this time, it was Heniba and Ke'an watching.

438
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,640
Right?

439
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
Three minutes isn't enough for him, is it? I want to ask.

440
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,839
Not enough. I don't think it's enough either.

441
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,400
You mean just the conveyor belt takes three minutes.

442
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,680
Then you kill him.

443
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,520
Where did you knock him out?

444
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,800
Three minutes.

445
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,200
Just the conveyor belt alone takes that long.

446
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,640
Then you have to set him up for the recording.

447
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
So if that's the case,

448
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,720
let's drop what we said earlier.

449
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
About being able to rule you two out.

450
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,680
Let's drop that idea.

451
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,120
Because it seems like everyone's time

452
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,360
isn't really enough.

453
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,280
Yeah.

454
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,600
We can't rule anyone out.

455
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,720
I discovered something else.

456
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,600
What I found was just Greedy Potato.

457
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,240
Or maybe he's Bold Tan.

458
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,480
What he found was also just

459
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,920
something unimportant.

460
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,160
But what Ba Fentang found was

461
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,000
my sister's bracelet was right here.

462
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,120
And my sister had streamed here before.

463
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
So her reasoning makes sense.

464
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
She realized this place is actually

465
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
a huge live streaming site.

466
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,280
That makes sense.

467
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,520
That makes sense.
So you used this method

468
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,560
to harm my sister.

469
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,200
Today I'll let you experience

470
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,160
what it's like to swap stars and moons.

471
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Yes.

472
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
When the two of them talk,

473
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,160
they keep looking into each other's eyes.

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,200
When the two of them talk,

475
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,280
they keep looking into each other's eyes.

476
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
Can you two pay a little more attention?

477
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,240
Whenever I talk to someone, we look each other in the eye.

478
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,760
No.

479
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,320
When she talks to us, she does it too.

480
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
They look at each other.

481
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,720
Can you pay attention to that?

482
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
But I think X and the culprit

483
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
wouldn't be so obvious.

484
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Because none of you noticed.

485
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,040
Only I noticed, because I am

486
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,920
Have you been watching me all along?

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
Whenever I make eye contact with someone,

488
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,200
you feel uncomfortable.

489
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
That makes sense.

490
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,600
That could be the case.

491
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,840
The sudden development of a love story

492
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
I could die right where I pick up breakfast

493
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,240
just die there

494
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,000
then I wouldn't have to go through that conveyor belt

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,760
we could change the background

496
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,960
just film it directly, and then

497
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
there will be plenty of time to move the body later

498
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,640
You need a green screen, right?

499
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,280
Or maybe it's the same space.

500
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
That's how you were able to record that video.

501
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,280
We have green screens everywhere.

502
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,640
Outside the serving window,

503
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,360
aren't there a bunch of green boxes?

504
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
What do you mean, the murder happened at the serving window?

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,120
Found it.

506
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,320
Found it.

507
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,120
This.
Over there.

508
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,600
This spot.

509
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,320
That means

510
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,280
it was sprayed here.

511
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,440
Golden ladle.

512
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,240
Was knocked out here with the spray.
Suppose I'm the boss.

513
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,920
I come to pick up the food.

514
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,240
Mr. Jin, I'm here to pick up the food.

515
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Right here.

516
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,800
In my opinion,

517
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,120
I think the most important thing is

518
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
he has to know

519
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,360
about the environment we're in.

520
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,280
Heniba is the only one

521
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,400
who knows that our factory

522
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,600
is not a real factory.

523
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,320
You need to find out what we're doing.

524
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I know about this streaming company.

525
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,200
Streaming company.

526
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,320
And also the green screen thing.

527
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,320
Maybe he knows about both.

528
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,760
Yes, that's right.

529
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
The green screen should also be

530
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,480
a very important point.

531
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,400
So he knows this exists.

532
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm serious, I really suspect him right now.

533
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,920
I am very, extremely suspicious of him.

534
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,120
Why?

535
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
This morning, it was 6:55.

536
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
I went into the bathroom.

537
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
I was inside washing up.

538
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,200
For about three minutes.

539
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,760
When I came out,

540
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
I ran into him in the hallway.

541
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,720
Where was he going?

542
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,920
I didn't see that either.

543
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,000
No, there's another issue.

544
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
There was a period of time

545
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,480
when the two of you didn't see each other.

546
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,160
So he wasn't going to the bathroom.

547
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
All I can say is, I suspect him.

548
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,680
You said you saw him.

549
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,280
It just so happened

550
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
that it was at 6:57, when the food was delivered.

551
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,040
So he was timing it to catch you

552
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,320
at the moment you delivered the food.

553
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,720
After catching you at that moment,

554
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,080
he immediately left right after.

555
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,320
He left and then ran into me.

556
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,760
That's right.

557
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,960
Then, when I saw him again,

558
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,160
it was 7:10 when he returned to his room.

559
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,240
What I'm really curious about is

560
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
where he was during those twelve minutes.

561
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,360
This person, when unable to be certain

562
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,120
about when I would be here today,

563
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,600
or when he could arrange this encounter,

564
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
he had one thing he could be sure of.

565
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
That was the time when Jin Tangshao delivered the meal.

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,320
6:57.

567
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Jin Tangshao did see him.

568
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,160
Today, little brother deserves major credit for that.

569
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,200
Don't get carried away, don't let yourself be misled.

570
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm telling you, you can think

571
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,120
that I'm highly suspicious.

572
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,880
But those two,

573
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
in terms of initial suspicion,

574
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,120
are much more suspicious than us.

575
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,560
So,

576
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,240
I think his reasoning is sound.

577
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,960
But at the same time, don't overlook her, okay?

578
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,280
Otherwise, this will suddenly

579
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
put all the blame on him alone.

580
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,840
I think that's a bit unfair.

581
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,600
Why is it unfair?

582
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,520
What's unfair about this?

583
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,280
What's unfair about this matter?

584
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,760
Others are also highly suspicious.

585
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,520
What,

586
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,240
is he your own son or something?

587
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,400
What's unfair about it?

588
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,720
Yeah, that's right.
He's my X.

589
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,040
He's my X.

590
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,240
I've made my choice.

591
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,840
Who do you want to vote for?
I've made my choice.

592
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
Tell me, who do you want to vote for?

593
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Probably one of those two.

594
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,720
He was acting strange today, didn't you notice?

595
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Was I acting strange?
A little bit.

596
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,640
Because he kept saying, "I am X."

597
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
I don't think a good person would act like that.

598
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Yeah, if I were—

599
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,600
I definitely wouldn't say, "I am X."

600
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
You never say it, but you always are.

601
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,160
It's you.

602
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,560
You never say anything, but you always are.

603
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,640
A precious vote
My vote goes to

604
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,360
Golden Spoon

605
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,720
Of course, I couldn't vote for myself

606
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,160
So I still think

607
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,360
she is the most suspicious

608
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,280
Today, my choice for the culprit is

609
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,960
Golden Spoon

610
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
I am using

611
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,080
the double voting right

612
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,200
The person I believe is the culprit is

613
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,800
Heniba

614
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,520
Bafentang

615
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,760
is Golden Spoon

616
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,440
Heniba

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,640
Six keys

618
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,000
What does that mean? One for each person?

619
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,320
One for each person
You won

620
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,680
I forgot

621
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
This person has a double ticket

622
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,520
He didn't use it, right?

623
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,600
Did you use it this round?

624
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,040
Didn't use it, right?

625
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,680
You probably didn't use it in the first round, right?

626
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,280
I used it
Really?

627
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,440
Used it right away

628
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,640
When I got this

629
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,680
I said I'd use it right away

630
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,240
I have the double golden key

631
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
So you can take two

632
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,840
But only if you win

633
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,240
Right

634
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,560
It's revealed

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,840
Come on, just this round

636
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
Everyone's going to fight over this now

637
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,200
Grab

638
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,800
Grab the key, right?

639
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,200
Grab the chair, we have to go around this

640
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,320
The keys seem pretty solid this time

641
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,400
This game

642
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,080
is lost, isn't it?
Defeat.

643
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
The real culprit is
Bafentang.

644
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,600
I think it’s definitely her.

645
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
You just won’t listen to me.

646
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,080
I’m not sure it’s her.

647
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,040
Then it must be one of those two.

648
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,960
You’re way too obvious.

649
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
He’s already ruled those two out.

650
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,000
But her situation...
Do you know why?

651
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,720
Why are you two looking at each other?

652
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I look at everyone, darling.

653
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,920
Don’t keep doing this because—

654
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,720
You two make eye contact a lot more.

655
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,120
Whenever she talks to anyone,

656
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,960
she’s always looking at him.
Yeah.

657
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,240
No.

658
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
Why are you two looking at each other?

659
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,160
Because he’s hosting.

660
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
He’s leading this.

661
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,840
Aren’t we all talking to him when we speak?

662
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,080
But your gaze is especially...

663
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,080
He’s the detective.

664
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,440
So am I. Why doesn’t anyone look at me?

665
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,520
You haven’t said a single nice thing, you know?

666
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
At the end of the day,

667
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,280
she’s just better at hiding.

668
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,760
There are just fewer people suspecting her.

669
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,280
That’s right.

670
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
You’ll notice in everyone’s timeline,

671
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
only you have the 7:10 return time.

672
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
My motive makes the least sense.

673
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,760
What’s wrong?

674
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,320
Scared me to death.

675
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
You startled me.

676
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,640
This is the person.

677
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,040
The one who ran away.

678
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,400
I was so scared the chain broke.

679
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,640
Laughing awkwardly.

680
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
I thought you were scared and embarrassed.

681
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Sorry.

682
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,560
I think the MVP of this episode

683
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
should be

684
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
I think it's Liu Yuning

685
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,440
because he

686
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,680
was very serious in managing the whole situation

687
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,720
which led me to narrow it down to him and Bai Yu in the end

688
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,240
and I thought Bai Yu was X based on the clue

689
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
then it made me finally identify

690
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
Ba as the culprit

691
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Of course, the best was still the younger brother

692
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
who, at the last moment, directed everyone's attention

693
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,520
towards Zhang Linghe

694
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,600
Yes

695
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,680
He did very well, really great

696
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,800
I hope he keeps it up

697
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,760
Today's MVP

698
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,560
must be Dilraba

699
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Throughout the whole process

700
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,480
her acting was so convincing

701
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,160
I did suspect her of being the culprit.

702
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,280
But her overall demeanor

703
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,320
seemed very confused throughout the process.

704
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,680
What does "turning dark" mean?

705
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
How does one "turn dark"?

706
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,600
Because when I was observing everyone,

707
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,520
she might have,

708
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,480
even when the focus wasn't on her,

709
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,880
she was still doing her own

710
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
performances within this environment.

711
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,400
So when I revealed

712
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,120
the answer,
I realized

713
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,800
I had forgotten

714
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
that she herself is

715
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
a truly outstanding actress.

716
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,000
I overlooked this fact in all of this.

717
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
That was my mistake.

718
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,600
So today, her acting was truly excellent.

719
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,800
She absolutely deserved to win in the end.

720
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,520
Ba-jie

721
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,160
We've known each other for so long,

722
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,800
and I couldn't see even the slightest change in her.

723
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,840
Also, everyone did a great job reasoning today,

724
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,560
and put in a lot of effort.

725
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,960
Everyone really tried hard to deduce the truth.

726
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,840
But still,

727
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
it was a bit unsatisfactory.

728
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,120
So I think it was a great success.

729
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,800
MVP

730
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,480
My MVP vote goes to

731
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,520
Bai Yu.

732
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,560
Because I

733
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,080
I kept suspecting

734
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
Reba and Jin Jing.

735
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
But Bai Yu

736
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,920
has been helping me attack Jin Jing.

737
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
He's trying to confuse everyone.

738
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,120
He makes me feel

739
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,600
like what I'm saying is absolutely right.

740
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
And at the same time,

741
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,360
he makes me overlook my suspicions about Reba.

742
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,280
Also, his behavior and Ning Ge's

743
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,960
form a very sharp contrast.

744
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,640
It makes me think Ning Ge is the X.

745
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,480
In "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3,

746
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,800
the MVP of the first episode is

747
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,520
myself.

748
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,080
I successfully escaped

749
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,920
from being the culprit.

750
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,280
I got the golden key.

751
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,120
Why is that?
Because

752
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I used my usual style,

753
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
which is just sitting there and saying,

754
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,280
"This is so complicated, I don't get it."

755
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,800
Wait, so the person from yesterday,

756
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,120
are they related to today?

757
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,240
No, but if it's

758
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,200
6:57 and 6:58,

759
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,120
then after that, couldn't everyone commit the crime?

760
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,960
What does that mean?

761
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
I have no idea what you're talking about.

762
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,640
That's how I won this game.

763
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,760
Goodbye
