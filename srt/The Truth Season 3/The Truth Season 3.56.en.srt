1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,160
We have to keep tracking this person.

2
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,240
But this person is dead.

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,560
Don't you find that strange?

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,520
You need to scan Mr. She's iris.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,320
Mission archive completed.

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,120
No match.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
So She is still alive.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,280
So, yes.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
She’s consciousness exists among you.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
You need to uncover the story behind She.

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Find the vessel She used to transfer consciousness.

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Real-time monitoring.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,480
We are now in the same time and space.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,640
So, we are from the future.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
It must be the Special Immigration Bureau.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,920
They sent us here.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,680
To accomplish a certain task.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
There’s a possibility like this.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,200
People from the future, through

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
the dead on this side, come back.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
People from the future

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,680
are reborn into present-day corpses.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,160
Rebirth Project.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
Future Human Rebirth Project.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
Rebirth Project.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120
Correct.

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,600
This is how they immigrate.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
They transfer their consciousness

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
over here.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,760
Yes.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,320
The year 2120.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Year 2120

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,240
The Special Immigration Bureau launches the Rebirth Project.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,960
This is the Rebirth Project.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
A person's consciousness can follow their genes.

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,080
He is a She-person.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
Traveling back a hundred years.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Inside the body that died in Tui City.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
Everyone's iris is unique.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
The iris of a reborn individual

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
will change along with their genes and consciousness

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,480
and transform.

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,759
The Special Immigration Bureau selected

44
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,280
the most outstanding and gifted children.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,880
They hope these children can go to

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Tui City a hundred years ago

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
to change the world's path toward doomsday.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
From the moment the first reborn arrived in Tui City,

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,640
the history and future here

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
have already been subtly altered.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,440
But we all know

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
the Special Immigration Bureau's plan

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
is absurd

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
and doomed to fail.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,600
If the people of Tui City could change,

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,120
our world wouldn't become a wasteland.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
We have an even more perfect

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,120
new Rebirth Project.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,960
This is our ultimate goal to achieve.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Yes, I understand everything.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
It's just that the Snake Clan has a different plan.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,680
That's right.

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,560
So what She said yesterday,

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
about us living in

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
dark and damp caves before,

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
was actually talking about the future.

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
She was actually referring to the world of the future.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,760
That's right.

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
The world of the future

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
is actually caused by humans today.

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Exactly.
So they want to seize

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,520
the place where humans live now.

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Once the Snake Clan takes over,
they will

74
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,960
rebuild it properly.

75
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
There's a code over there.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
Our ultimate goal to achieve

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,720
is the New Rebirth Project.

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
Immortality.

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,520
No illness or disaster.

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,560
The New Rebirth Project.

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
It's open.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,480
Bring it over.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,920
What's inside?
What did you find?

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
This model

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
is the one from the Billion Push Film Company

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
There are

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,920
two lines of text behind it

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,520
This building is called

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
"We Will Meet Again"

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,520
Dad

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Although we will never have the chance to meet again

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
I will do my best in this world

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680
to leave my mark

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,000
It will represent my reunion with you in the future

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Little She

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
Then Dad left her a message, saying, "Daughter,

97
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,680
In the year 2122,

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
you were chosen by the Special Transfer Bureau at the age of eight

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
but died in 2023

100
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
I was reborn in Push City too late

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,480
I couldn't be reborn at an earlier time

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,080
to save you
Your idea

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
was ultimately a naive wish

104
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
Your departure made me realize

105
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
that people today

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
cannot rely on their own strength

107
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,720
to solve their own problems

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
nor can they suppress selfishness and cruelty

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,120
We should directly replace them

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
We would cherish the blue seas and skies of today even more

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
On the ruins of your soul

112
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,560
I will build a brand new world

113
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
That actually sounds pretty impressive.

114
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,520
This is little She.

115
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,040
He's trying to save his daughter.

116
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
Did little She do this?

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
It's dedicated to her father.

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,280
It's the official immigration bureau.

119
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,040
His plan is
Someone died on this side.

120
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,800
Then the people on this side
just use this body as an opportunity

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
to come over.

122
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
For example, in 2025,

123
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
an eight-year-old girl dies.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
So in this world,

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,280
we find an eight-year-old girl.

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,840
Didn't he say you were chosen by the special immigration bureau?

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
So, okay.

128
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
Now they need an eight-year-old girl over there.

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
They just grab any suitable one.

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
And send you over.
Then they tell you

131
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,720
you're going back to 2025

132
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
to change the world

133
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,920
and make this world better.

134
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
To benefit us.

135
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,040
Right.

136
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
This is the special immigration bureau's plan.

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,520
But now She says

138
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,920
this kind of thing is too absurd.

139
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
We have a more perfect plan

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
that can change this world.
Right.

141
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
So, a hundred years later, there are two groups of people.

142
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
One group is the Snake Clan.

143
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,720
The other is the Special Immigration Bureau.

144
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
Yes.

145
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,520
We are the ones chosen by the Immigration Bureau.

146
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
We have to go back to 2025

147
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,800
to stop She’s plan.

148
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
But we are being

149
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
constantly stopped by the Snake Clan.

150
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,880
Right, because they make us lose our memories.

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Do you know why?

152
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,120
The real turning point

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
between the Snake Clan and humans

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,520
is very simple.

155
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
The Special Immigration Bureau’s plan for humans is

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,120
to select outstanding children to replace them here

157
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,280
and work hard to save the future.

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
The Snake Clan wants to

159
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,960
replace the entire world.

160
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Why did you say you want to replace everyone?

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,480
Because this is the plan of the Snake Clan.

162
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
The Snake Clan's goal is the highest priority.

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
It says on it,

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I was reborn too late.

165
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,480
I couldn't be reborn earlier to save you.

166
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
But your departure made me realize

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,760
that people nowadays

168
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,280
can't rely on their own strength

169
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
to solve their own problems.

170
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Nor can they suppress their selfishness and cruelty.

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
We should just come and replace them directly.

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,200
We would cherish the blue seas and skies more.

173
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
Then what you said is right.
Makes sense.

174
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Yes.

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,200
The Special Relocation Bureau will let some people come over.

176
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,320
To change this world.

177
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,680
She is the one who changes my world.

178
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
I brought my entire Snake Clan back.

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
To live here.

180
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,680
Adults and children, men and women, young and old.

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Replace all the people of the future.

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Yes.

183
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,240
There's blood on this doll.

184
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,160
There's a button below that says "press me."
Let's listen to what it says.

185
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Okay.

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
Why are you crying?

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,400
We came to Kaitui Farm to play.

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
You keep running around everywhere.

189
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,520
You're so annoying.

190
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,360
She's already stopped breathing.

191
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,080
Why did you hit her so hard?

192
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
You hit her plenty yourself.

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,520
And now you blame me?

194
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,840
Last time, you were the one who pushed her down the stairs.

195
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,000
She didn't even die from the fall.

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,160
Why couldn't she take it this time?

197
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,960
Enough talking.

198
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Think about what to do.

199
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Throw her in the river.

200
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,720
Once she's washed away, no one will trace it back to us.

201
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,200
I get it now.

202
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,800
This six-year-old girl didn't fall for no reason.

203
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,280
Her parents have been beating her all along.

204
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
It's the child in the water.
Suitcase.

205
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
I've got goosebumps.

206
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
This is a person.

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
Are those human bones?

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Isn't that a human head?

209
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
It's been dismembered.

210
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
This is a doll.

211
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
So that's the little girl.

212
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes.

213
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
This person is so evil.

214
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,960
These parents...

215
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
She died.

216
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
In a few days,

217
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,680
we won't be able to deliver to Yun Island.

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
We'll lose a lot of money.

219
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
Let's find an orphan girl to pretend.

220
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
Little girls all look pretty similar.

221
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,240
Just get similar clothes and a doll.

222
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,200
A relative from Tuitu Village told me

223
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
there's a homeless orphan girl on the street over there.

224
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,160
She's about the same age as our daughter.

225
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,400
Okay.

226
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
Just lure the little girl over with a doll.

227
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
This teddy bear is dirty.

228
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,680
We can't use it.

229
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,840
Where's our daughter's doll?

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Did we pack it in the suitcase?

231
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,360
Forget it.
Don't open it.

232
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,920
It's bad luck.

233
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
That doll was a buy-one-get-one-free.

234
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,360
There's another one just like it.

235
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,960
Use that one.

236
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
The suitcase.

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
I've got goosebumps.

238
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,920
What is this talking about?

239
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,000
It's this.

240
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The girl who accidentally fell.

241
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Yesterday, there was an eight-year-old girl.

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
She was playing on the balcony.

243
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,840
She accidentally fell.

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
I think they want to find another girl.

245
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,280
To replace their own daughter.

246
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,880
Then who are they sending her to?

247
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Yun Island.

248
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,200
Yun Island.

249
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,600
Ren Weishan.

250
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
That swapped child.

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,880
The child's DNA.

252
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
This person sent a message.

253
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Ren, we still have

254
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,280
two nautical miles to go.

255
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,720
We'll be at Yun Island soon.

256
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Is everything ready?

257
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes.
So this child

258
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
was being transported to Yun Island at that time.

259
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
They wanted to send the child there, but

260
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,600
their own died.

261
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,640
So they wanted to find a new child as a replacement.

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,320
For a deal.

263
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,840
This just proves that the parents

264
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,280
treated her
with child abuse.

265
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,120
Cold-blooded.

266
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,880
And that was their own child.

267
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,560
Falling downstairs didn't kill her.

268
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
Actually, she died at that time.

269
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
But little She came back again.

270
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,640
So they killed little She again.

271
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,600
Killed her.

272
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,640
So little She's father

273
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,800
got angry and said

274
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,880
We traveled back with hope and love

275
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,960
to let you change the world.

276
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,640
But you were still killed by these cruel parents,

277
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,320
humans.

278
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
So the She people turned dark.

279
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,440
Yes.

280
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,520
So in that special immigration bureau

281
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,800
among the smart kids they sent,

282
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,880
was his daughter among them?

283
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,640
Yes.

284
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,680
So this little She is his daughter.

285
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes.

286
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
This person is also from the future.

287
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,360
Yes.
Right.

288
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
He thought they came to do good things.

289
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
Then he came up with an idea.

290
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
He blew up that place.
To get his daughter...

291
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
Maybe to save her.

292
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
But his daughter probably couldn't be saved.

293
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,760
No.

294
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
At first, the She people might have been good.

295
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
He thought his child came to change the world.

296
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,000
But he didn't expect that after his child came,

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
she would still be killed.

298
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,320
Because She's daughter

299
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,080
traveled to the past,

300
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
but was still

301
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,920
mercilessly killed by humans.

302
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Correct.

303
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,080
Angry.

304
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,440
I want revenge.

305
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
You want revenge.

306
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, me.

307
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
It's She’s father.

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Is that true?

309
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,880
So that's the plan.

310
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,200
There's also a phone.

311
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,480
There's also a notebook inside.

312
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
It's been taken out.

313
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,480
There's also a key.

314
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Preliminary preparations.

315
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
From 2023 to 2025.

316
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,520
Collect and create more vessels in the city.

317
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
But act discreetly.

318
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Don't attract attention.

319
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,360
From 2123 to 2125.

320
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,920
Gather members with the same beliefs in the city.

321
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
Let them be reborn in batches.

322
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
Let's look at the first plan.

323
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,840
From 2023 to 2025, he

324
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
wants to collect and create more vessels.

325
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,520
Vessels mean making
corpses.

326
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,600
Make more corpses.

327
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
But act discreetly.
Don't attract attention.

328
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
So what's his method?

329
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
Invest in Ning Lightbulb in advance.

330
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,280
The live-streamed killings were just my idea.

331
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
He found me.

332
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,800
He invested five million in me.

333
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,520
He also helped me accomplish something.

334
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,040
And what was that?

335
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
That every live-streamed killing would result in a death.

336
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
The final corpse

337
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,880
would be taken care of for you.

338
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,680
That's right.

339
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,920
Let Ning Dengpao start a live-streamed killing.

340
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,840
Then create a corpse as a vessel.

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
February 26, 2025.

342
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,160
Ning Dengpao was exposed.

343
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Explain this.
What's going on here?

344
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Actually, I

345
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,160
am the real owner of this streaming base.

346
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,080
So you're the big boss.

347
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right.
I didn't do it for long.

348
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,920
Yeah, not for long.

349
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,120
Then you guys caught me.

350
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,760
Then monitor everyone at the Tuitian Food Factory.

351
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,680
If there's a risk of exposure, blow up the food factory.

352
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,280
Destroy the evidence.

353
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Pirate Mansion.

354
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Big Sister's daughter.

355
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Who is Big Sister's daughter?
My daughter.

356
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,960
Good Baby, do you remember?

357
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,480
That green one—

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,800
The one who knocked on the door with the green glass.

359
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,360
She's mine.

360
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,920
She is the daughter of Ba Snake and Heshe Snake.

361
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,880
Her name is Heniba.

362
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,640
She was sold to

363
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Ren Weishan's Yun Island.

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,520
She became a consumable for the rich in their pursuit of immortality.

365
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
We must find the location of Yun Island.

366
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Rescue my niece.

367
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,920
These people with wealth and status

368
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,040
are the best vessels.

369
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
He said, President Ren,

370
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,360
that mysterious person bought

371
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,640
our list of wealthy clients,

372
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,400
and forty percent of the rich

373
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
stopped doing business with us.

374
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,640
Ren Weishan seems to be investigating me.

375
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,240
On the night of March 14, 2025,

376
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
he will take his men to Pirate Mansion.

377
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,200
Monitor everyone inside Pirate Mansion.

378
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,280
Look for an opportunity

379
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,760
to blow them all up.

380
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,880
We need to find the bombs.

381
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,040
Hurry, look for them.

382
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
There are three here in total.

383
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
Yes, hurry and find them.

384
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,760
We're doomed, we're going to be blown up.

385
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,880
Let's hug each other quickly.

386
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,440
Let's hug together, everyone.

387
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
Hug together.

388
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Tui Baiyi Film Company.

389
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
Finally, we've found out

390
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
that the Tui Baiyi Film Company's

391
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,640
"All staff" and "Yuan Gong"

392
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,720
are the couple who caused my daughter's death.

393
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,520
Yuan Gong? What does "all staff Yuan Gong" mean?

394
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
Come, who's this?

395
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,720
Engineer Yuan.

396
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,800
That boy just now, the wedding photo.

397
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
Those two who turned into zombies just now.

398
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,480
Those two people, right?

399
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,320
This abuse.

400
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
The one in the recording.

401
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,920
The two people in the recording.

402
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,600
April 23, 2025.

403
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Caused an explosion at the Tui Baiyi company.

404
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
So every time there's a bomb,

405
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,560
it kills the people here.
All the staff.

406
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
Let them become vessels for rebirth.

407
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,160
And then Engineer Yuan

408
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,840
actually put his daughter's model

409
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
on his workstation.

410
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,840
I need to go get the stuff back.

411
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
Why didn't it explode?
A virus appeared there.

412
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Everyone, including Engineer Yuan, is already infected.

413
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,640
They died from the poison.

414
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,400
The daughter got her revenge, in a way.

415
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,760
It's all connected now.

416
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,760
Tuitu Village.

417
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,440
So they were hiding here.

418
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Let Tui Taiye handle it

419
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,560
Collect more bodies

420
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
Rebirth vessel storage

421
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,320
Goodhouse private ice cellar

422
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,920
May 9, 2025

423
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,400
5:44

424
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,720
Using the Tuitu Village event as cover

425
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,360
to conduct the rebirth ritual

426
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,200
so that the core members of the organization

427
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,240
can be reborn into the best bodies

428
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,240
That was yesterday morning

429
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,280
when we performed that ritual

430
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,760
It was a rebirth ritual
We attended it

431
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Those people seemed like something was implanted in them

432
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,840
Then they hugged each other

433
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,080
as if they remembered something

434
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Yeah
They were very happy

435
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,240
Yeah

436
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
And for a while, they were lying on the ground

437
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
unconscious
Suddenly, they stood up

438
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Suddenly, they stood up and reunited

439
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Rebirth

440
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,360
When we reunited, it felt like we succeeded.

441
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,880
That feeling
is like

442
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,720
finally
coming back to life.

443
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,280
Alive again.

444
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,360
That person is actually a core member of the organization.

445
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
Then so are we.

446
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,120
We’re imitating them.

447
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,880
We’re six fools.

448
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,600
Imitating them.

449
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,440
The most important day has come.

450
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,000
May 10th, the most important day.

451
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
That’s today.

452
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
The members head to Tui City.

453
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Planting bombs everywhere.

454
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,800
To cause a massive explosion.

455
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,520
What?

456
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,320
After everyone in Tui City enters the shelters,

457
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
the shelters will release poison gas.

458
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
After they die,

459
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
all the organization members

460
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,280
will be reborn and return to Tui City.

461
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,120
Three bomb remote controls are hidden in Tuitu Village.

462
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,280
The map showing where the remotes are hidden is split into two parts.

463
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,200
Each part is hidden in a different place at headquarters.

464
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
What does that mean, bro?
He means

465
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
they’re going to release poison gas

466
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,520
in all the shelters.

467
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,840
This could kill

468
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,880
everyone in the city.

469
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
So no matter what today,

470
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,280
we have to stop this explosion.

471
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes, we must stop the explosion.

472
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,840
Let’s check the notes first.

473
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
Rebirth research notes.

474
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
It says on it

475
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,160
Every time someone is reborn, fog appears

476
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,600
Targeted rebirth

477
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,360
To solve the "pushing eyes" issue

478
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,120
the drawbacks of random rebirth

479
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,600
I discovered targeted rebirth through my research

480
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
Encoding the genes

481
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,600
onto the bronze bell device

482
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Bronze bell

483
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,880
Above your head
This one

484
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
That's the one

485
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,840
With this, targeted rebirth is possible, actually

486
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,640
By using this technology

487
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,240
our family members from 2125

488
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,000
can precisely be reborn into

489
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,160
bodies from 2025

490
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,440
That's right
This is the one you all

491
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Yesterday, we learned about that plan

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,040
Yes, the one with the talisman

493
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,000
February 26, 2025

494
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,680
Organization member

495
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,280
successfully reborn from An Wenzhe's body

496
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,360
Test successful

497
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,160
That day, we found a notebook.

498
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,000
It mentioned an explosion at the Tuitian Food Factory.

499
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Only

500
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,680
seven bodies were found.

501
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,760
Explosion witness record from the neighboring factory area.

502
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,880
On the night of February 26, 2025,

503
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
an explosion occurred at the neighboring Tuitian Food Factory.

504
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,640
According to the boss's instructions,

505
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,280
we went next door to patrol and investigate.

506
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,920
Seven bodies were carried out from the factory.

507
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
After identification, it was confirmed that

508
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
the owner of Tuitian Food Factory, Tan Qian,

509
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,960
and six employees

510
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,920
were among them. The site was cleaned up.

511
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,880
The staff worked until the early hours of the next day.

512
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,319
It was confirmed that there were no other people at the scene.

513
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,560
No one survived.

514
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,119
An Wenzhe.

515
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,359
We suspect he didn't die.

516
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:10,520
Right.

517
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,720
But here it says

518
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
he actually died at that time.

519
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,520
It just says that a member of the organization

520
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,920
successfully used An Wenzhe's body to be reborn.

521
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Yes, it was taken.

522
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,839
And the person who came to see us yesterday

523
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,359
do you remember?
It was An Wenzhe.

524
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,640
Take him inside. Go.

525
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
Possession of a body.

526
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
So is An Wenzhe

527
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,120
actually a core member of the organization?

528
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,640
Then, on April 1, 2025,

529
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,400
five family members were brought back to life.

530
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Five family members.

531
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,440
Yue, you, him, four, five.

532
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,440
Yes.
That's right.

533
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
Family, we've been reborn again.

534
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,480
Family.

535
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,520
May 9, 2025

536
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
Yueshe regained her memory

537
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,800
She wanted to stop me

538
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,280
I decided to send her consciousness

539
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,600
back to the year 2125 first

540
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,320
She told you I had something to do and needed to go out

541
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
But actually, she had regained her memory

542
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,040
He sent her back

543
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
After the big plan succeeds

544
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,840
she will be allowed to return and be reborn

545
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Because earlier, there was a customer

546
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,760
in our shop

547
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,760
Then she added me on WeChat

548
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,000
And yesterday, she sent me a message

549
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,640
at around two in the morning

550
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,520
Later, she asked me to come here

551
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,320
Her name is Yue Liang

552
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,240
She said she had something to tell me

553
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,640
But it might be hard to explain over the phone

554
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
So she wanted to tell me in person

555
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
She said, "Sister, I am your biological younger sister"

556
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,760
Our family was in danger.

557
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,840
We got separated.

558
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,040
She wouldn't let me leave here.

559
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,560
She said it's dangerous outside.
I see, she wanted you to stay here, right?

560
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,800
She had to go deal with some problems.

561
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,680
Consciousness transfer.

562
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
To make up for my mistake.

563
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,000
To switch Ba Snake and Golden Snake back.

564
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,360
It's because you two switched incorrectly.

565
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,560
Right.

566
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,440
If the original form is a snake,

567
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,840
Actually, I entered the wrong body.

568
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,800
I should have entered this body.
Right.

569
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,720
Because my original form is a snake, right?

570
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,640
Right.

571
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I kept trying consciousness transfer techniques.

572
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
You even killed the eldest brother.

573
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,360
Look how good he was.

574
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,240
He kept trying.

575
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
He kept helping you try.

576
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
It was accidental.

577
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
While talking, I ended up grabbing a knife.

578
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
The conversation got heated.

579
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,040
She did this to help you two switch back.

580
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,360
She discovered something.

581
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,880
That is,

582
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,400
consciousness can be transferred to a human body

583
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
or to a humanoid object.

584
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
It's not just corpses anymore.

585
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,040
Now it can be people too.

586
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,840
Like that paper figure.

587
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Even the paper figure works now.
A mannequin.

588
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Right.

589
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,720
It says below,

590
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
if the consciousness

591
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,160
is transferred into a human body,

592
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,120
meaning into a living person,

593
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,440
the original consciousness

594
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,040
will enter

595
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,040
a sleep

596
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
or dormant state.

597
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
If it transfers to a living person,

598
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Right, for example,
if this person transfers into your body,

599
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
your personality, Bai Yu, would disappear.

600
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,280
It would go to sleep.

601
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,200
Bai Yu.
Bai Yu, wake up.

602
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Don't let him take over you, Bai Yu.

603
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
No, he took over first.

604
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Then I was automatically replaced.

605
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,080
Blocked.

606
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
Yes, blocked.

607
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,920
There's one more thing.

608
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,360
A breakthrough discovery.

609
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,560
It's possible to split one consciousness into

610
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,720
two.

611
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
What does that mean?

612
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
Splitting one consciousness into two.

613
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,080
That means there could be two people.

614
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,040
So there could be two She.

615
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Qing She and Bai She.

616
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,840
So now it means

617
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
Da She’s body has been taken over.

618
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,800
In this case,

619
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,560
there might not be just one

620
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Da She present.

621
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,680
It could be two.

622
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Yes.

623
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,760
A temporary resurrection method for the investigators.

624
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,800
The Special Immigration Bureau found out about my plan.

625
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,240
They plan to send six investigators.

626
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,360
From the year 2125.

627
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,960
Our purpose for coming

628
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,160
is to investigate She.
To investigate She.

629
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Yes.

630
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
The Special Immigration Bureau found out about my plan.

631
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
So they plan to send six.

632
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
Brave, handsome,

633
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,800
beautiful, and alluring.

634
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,680
Are there really those kinds?

635
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
He would write it like that.

636
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
When you first said six,

637
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,160
I was very unclear.
But when you added those descriptions,

638
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I think

639
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,480
the image became vivid.

640
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
It’s clear now, yes.

641
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,800
The Special Transfer Bureau modified my reincarnation technology.

642
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
It allows six investigators

643
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,160
to repeatedly reincarnate briefly into living people.

644
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
For the first forty hours after reincarnation,

645
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
they will be in a state of amnesia.

646
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
They receive the original body's memories

647
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,080
and believe they are the original person.

648
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
It's as if our original selves never died.

649
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,200
That's how it is.

650
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
Every time we arrive at a new scene,

651
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
for the first forty hours,

652
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,760
we can't remember anything.

653
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,040
Right.

654
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,120
Once forty hours pass,

655
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,320
we suddenly remember everything.

656
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,280
But just as we remember,
we get blown up.

657
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,800
Every time,

658
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,320
we're blown up just as we're about to regain our memories.

659
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,280
We're really strong, beautiful, and tragic.

660
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,800
The Special Transfer Bureau wants them to reincarnate into

661
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,680
May 10, 2025,

662
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,520
their own bodies,

663
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,440
and then come to stop me.

664
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
Their own bodies.

665
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
That one.

666
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,480
Investigator Lu Ying.

667
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,640
Why is this phone moving by itself, bro?

668
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
What does this mean?

669
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,880
You have deviated from the route.

670
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,640
Okay, there's a call.

671
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,760
This desktop shows a cow and a horse.

672
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,120
That means he's called Niu Ma.

673
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,960
That's probably his subordinate.

674
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Niu Ma's WeChat.

675
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,000
Early yesterday morning

676
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,280
at exactly 5:44

677
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,160
She said

678
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,600
That was close, I almost died

679
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
I was stabbed

680
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,880
In order to help Jin She and Ba She

681
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,760
switch bodies

682
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
I researched consciousness transfer techniques

683
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,400
and it actually saved me at a critical moment

684
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
Right before I died

685
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,400
I transferred my consciousness into the paper figure in the ancestral hall

686
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,680
which led to what happened today

687
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
That's great, boss

688
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,520
Who was the attacker?

689
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,760
I'll take him out and avenge you

690
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
She said, "Avenge what?"

691
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,960
I didn't die, did I?

692
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,840
The younger ones just lost their heads for a moment

693
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,840
They'll understand my intentions one day

694
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,760
Alright, alright

695
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,680
But for now

696
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
we really can't let them

697
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,160
keep causing trouble outside

698
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
and ruin my plans

699
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,320
What are you crying for?

700
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,880
Such fake crying

701
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,280
Pretending to feel guilty
Crocodile tears

702
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
You are Jin Jing now

703
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,720
Jin Jing, 118 years old

704
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
Then he asked, what should we do?

705
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,480
Should we lock them up?

706
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,520
She said,

707
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,640
It's been a long time since I played games with my younger siblings.

708
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,120
Let's have a family game.

709
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Pervert.

710
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
I will split my consciousness in two.

711
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,200
And transfer them separately

712
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,720
into the two paper dolls in the ancestral hall.

713
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I deliberately left clues on the phone.

714
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,560
After they see them, they'll enter the ancestral hall.

715
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,800
Each person will take a paper doll.

716
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,840
And enter the meditation room.

717
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,800
The ones who get the two special paper dolls

718
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,640
when they touch the heart of the paper doll,

719
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
my consciousness

720
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,360
can take the opportunity to transfer into their bodies.

721
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,720
After controlling these two people,

722
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
I can blend in among them.

723
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,120
On one hand, I can stop them from ruining my plan,

724
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
and on the other, look for a chance to lock them up again.

725
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,280
Now you know everything, right?

726
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:55,960
Okay.
Got it.

727
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,200
One thing is certain.

728
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,720
Among us,

729
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,280
there are two bad guys today.

730
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
These two people,

731
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,400
I don't know if you had time

732
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
to recognize each other.
How about this:

733
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,600
Let's all close our eyes.

734
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,440
Let these two people

735
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,880
do it this way, that's how it is today.

736
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm a fair person.

737
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,880
You all close your eyes.

738
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,640
Congratulations.

739
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,560
You've successfully uncovered She's story.

740
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,040
Next, you still need to find

741
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
the one hiding among you

742
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
with She's consciousness.

743
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,880
And you found a key.

744
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Come on.

745
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,760
Open it, isn't there a lock?

746
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,840
Use it to open that.

747
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,080
I think that one's scary.

748
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,000
But once you open it,

749
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160
won't the countdown start?

750
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,800
Yes.

751
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,120
The countdown is about to start.

752
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,120
Wait a second.

753
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,360
This is remote bomb one.

754
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,120
The countdown has started.

755
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,600
The countdown is already underway.
Really.

756
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,640
Here, this bomb.

757
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,200
Friends,

758
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,480
Be careful, don't let it explode.

759
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,600
Let me read it to you.

760
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
If you want to deactivate this bomb,

761
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,040
we need to, right now,

762
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
guess correctly who "She" is.

763
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
And it has to be two people.

764
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
If we guess wrong,

765
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,760
it'll explode right now.

766
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,760
It'll go off immediately.

767
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,160
Let it explode.
Let it explode, right now.

768
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,760
I'll just cut these two wires.

769
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
No, it's about guessing both people correctly at the same time.

770
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,400
How is that possible?

771
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,160
If that's the case,

772
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,680
then this bomb will definitely go off.

773
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,800
Just let go, okay?

774
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Also, go down.
Look down.

775
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,120
Verification method.

776
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
Both people put on the iris verification glasses.

777
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,640
Stand on the snake pattern on the floor.

778
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,440
It's outside.
No.

779
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,440
It's here.

780
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,040
This.

781
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,320
Right.
Stand here.

782
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
Face the eyeball, the one in front.

783
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,840
This one, let's go with this.

784
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,880
Wait for the laser scan.

785
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,680
Don't put it on yet.
Wait a moment.

786
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,160
We'll verify in a moment, just wait.

787
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Don't, don't rush.

788
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm not rushing, no one's rushing.

789
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,720
Don't rush.

790
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,040
You're getting anxious.

791
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
Why do you care if I'm anxious?

792
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,160
It's you, actually.

793
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,000
There's one more.

794
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,960
You can turn on the consciousness monitoring remote.

795
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,520
Turn it on.

796
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Pressed it.

797
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
It's on.

798
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
That one's on.

799
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
That one's on. That one.

800
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Consciousness monitoring.

801
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,800
Three people need to be tested at the same time.

802
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,400
There are only two chances to test.

803
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,760
Testers must press both hands firmly on the spherical buttons.

804
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,160
If She’s consciousness is detected inside,

805
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,320
an electric current will be triggered as a warning.

806
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,600
Okay.
Okay.

807
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Combinations.
This is a bit hard.

808
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,320
This is fun.

809
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
Should we just take the risk?

810
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,040
I think I’m pretty clean.

811
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,320
I think he’s clean too.

812
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
I think you’re clean too.

813
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,120
Let’s have the three of us go.

814
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,080
I’m clean, but—

815
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,040
Alright, let’s have the three of us try.

816
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,720
Wait a second.

817
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,400
Should we have a round of debate first,

818
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
and then try?
That works too.

819
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Let’s do a round first.
I don’t think we need to rush.

820
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,800
Let’s do a round first.
Let’s debate first.

821
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,920
Right now, I think you’re very clean.

822
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,440
Why do you think I’m so clean?

823
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,080
Why are you giving me
the label of being clean?

824
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,560
Because I need to pick three people right now.

825
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,320
I think your state is really good right now.

826
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,200
Because if you pick a bad person,

827
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,040
but what if you’re the bad one?

828
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Exactly, that's why I think you're even more innocent.

829
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,520
Wait.

830
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Why is she so eager to take the test?

831
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,120
I think it's fine to take the test.

832
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
Listen to me, I know what you mean.

833
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,920
If the test shows that one of the three of us is it,

834
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,520
it's the same.

835
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,640
No, the reason she's eager to test

836
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,560
is because she wants to quickly put herself

837
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,320
in the group with the two innocent people.

838
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,200
Because she knows you two are innocent.

839
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,640
It's fine.

840
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
Her eagerness to test

841
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,320
is definitely not the behavior of a bad person.

842
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
Why?

843
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,000
Because the four of us good people are

844
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,400
a relatively large group.
Let me tell you,

845
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,520
when there are truly four good people,

846
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,680
they argue very intensely.

847
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,760
It's possible that the two bad people don't say a word.

848
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,560
Who isn't talking?

849
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,200
They could also be the bad guys.

850
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
During intense arguments,

851
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,880
everyone is thinking like a good person.

852
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,120
That's how we can all see it.

853
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,760
Do you get it? That's the logic.
Okay, sure.

854
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,200
It's possible, that's possible.

855
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,120
No, let's do this:

856
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,200
Don't rush to test yet.

857
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
Let's have a round of debate first.

858
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,920
Okay.
This is the most correct.

859
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,520
That's exactly what I mean.

860
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,760
Sit.

861
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,840
Everyone, calm down first.

862
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,600
Sit.

863
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,040
We have a strategy now.

864
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,560
Go ahead.
Can we

865
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,520
put the two most suspicious people

866
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
in the same group?

867
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,760
That would narrow things down.

868
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Yes.

869
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,960
If we get it wrong this round,

870
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
we'll have two out of six to choose from.

871
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
If we get it right this round,

872
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
we'll have at least two out of three to choose from.

873
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,840
Right.
Only then can we
That's right.

874
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,040
do this with a better chance of winning.

875
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,880
Exactly.

876
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
I think

877
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,320
did I just pick the right three clean people?

878
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,600
Three clean people.

879
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,840
Then the two bad guys found out.

880
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,880
So they urgently tried to stop us.

881
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,240
Are you saying I stopped you?

882
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,400
I think there's no need to rush.

883
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,280
Let's discuss it first.

884
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,640
Are you saying I stopped you?

885
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,560
No, you didn't stop me.
She was talking about him.

886
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,160
Me?

887
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,320
Why is she so eager to try?

888
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,760
But the problem is, do the two of them know about each other?

889
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,200
Did they attach themselves to each other?

890
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,920
If they know about each other,

891
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,480
not necessarily.

892
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,840
But the problem is, just now when we finished, we didn't

893
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,480
necessarily know.

894
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,120
Because he split off alone.

895
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,560
Okay.
Okay.

896
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,960
You finish first, I'll listen to you.
Go ahead.

897
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,760
Look,

898
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
if she's the killer,

899
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,480
she actively let me and him join.

900
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
If all three of us joined,

901
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,960
then the two killers couldn't be together.

902
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,440
What do you mean?
Between the two of us, there must be

903
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
at least one good person, right?

904
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,480
Yes, that's what I meant just now.

905
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,240
So,

906
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,640
if she's the killer,

907
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,520
she just pulled me and him in.

908
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
That's right.

909
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
He agreed too.

910
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,640
Yes.
He agreed too.

911
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,960
If those two are

912
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,200
they can't be together.

913
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,960
Right.

914
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,000
Isn't that right?

915
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,640
Who would be afraid to try?

916
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Only a good person would hesitate to speak up.

917
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,680
Wait a minute.

918
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,720
I'm not sure.

919
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,320
But why would a bad person dare to try?

920
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,280
Maybe he thinks

921
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,960
he can blend in and hide among us.

922
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,360
Right.
That's why he would agree right away.

923
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,440
Right.

924
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I agree with you.

925
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,920
You agreed right away, just now.

926
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,280
I didn't.

927
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,320
I even argued with her just now.

928
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,640
The two of us were arguing with her.

929
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,160
Right.
Okay.

930
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,800
Then how about the three of us try?

931
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,520
No.

932
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,240
What do you think?
You

933
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,400
Alright, I got it.

934
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,240
I have a ticket now.

935
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,360
What do you think?

936
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,560
You see your teammate here.

937
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,040
I know, I have a ticket now.

938
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't.
I have a ticket now.

939
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,120
Let them speak first.

940
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,760
Don't rush.
Let me finish.

941
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,560
You go first.
Listen to him.

942
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,720
What I need right now is

943
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,920
Let's vote first, then talk.

944
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,520
Okay?

945
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,960
Alright, let's start voting.

946
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,600
I think it's you two.

947
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Pair up.

948
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,880
Okay.
Great!

949
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,240
We have to win today.

950
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,600
We're really pairing up today, sis.

951
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,640
We're really pairing up today.

952
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I think it's you two, one big and one small.

953
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
Which two? Us two?

954
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,560
How do you want to split into groups to test?

955
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,320
It's the three of us—how should we group?

956
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,960
Then arrange this.

957
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,600
Just the three of us.

958
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,920
And the three of you.

959
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,560
Alright.
Got it.

960
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,000
Based on what just happened,

961
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
I think the more aggressive people

962
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,000
seem more likely to be good in my view.

963
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,240
I’d prefer if the three of us try.

964
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,720
Because I think the bad guys

965
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,600
now seem to be Ning and Ba.

966
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,640
I think it might be two "She".

967
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Because just now, Ning was in the cell

968
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
and kept not going up.

969
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,920
To me, it looked like stalling for time.

970
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,720
If all six of us go up,

971
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
we can’t raise our hands that high.

972
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,480
The six of us can’t make it up there.

973
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,480
Okay, got it, I understand.

974
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:25,760
Alright.

975
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,920
If

976
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,800
let me follow your logic.
Okay.

977
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,000
Maybe one of Ning or Ba

978
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,720
The two of them can be together,

979
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,480
and then add one more at random.

980
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,360
So, if you analyze it this way,

981
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,800
you think one of them is "She".

982
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
Put them in one group first.

983
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Then the remaining three are us.

984
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,320
Who do you think is most "She" among us?

985
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
Then just assign that person over there.

986
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
The three of us:

987
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,120
You and me,
No, except for yourself.

988
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,320
You know you’re a good person.

989
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Right.

990
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,520
It’s He, Jin, and Ke.

991
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,080
Which one of us three is "She"?

992
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,000
You’re not really "She".

993
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,520
I’ll rule you out for now, okay?

994
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,640
I’ll trust you for the time being.

995
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,000
Alright.
Then it’s between those two.

996
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
It’s a one out of two between us.

997
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,360
You’ll definitely pick me. Who else would you choose?

998
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,280
Can I think about it before giving my answer?

999
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,640
Okay.

1000
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,800
Let me think about it before I answer.

1001
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,520
Alright, but I already have my answer.

1002
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,720
Based on the test you just did,

1003
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,320
and their reactions,

1004
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
I’m also more certain about my answer.

1005
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,640
I think it’s those two.

1006
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,320
The two of us?
Yes.

1007
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,680
We’re together again.
Yeah.

1008
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,480
Alright.

1009
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,280
So here’s how it is now.

1010
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,680
I’ve already prepared for two people.

1011
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,760
One is him, the other is her.

1012
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,440
I’m definitely ready.

1013
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,560
If you want to take him to try,

1014
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,480
I agree with that.

1015
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,760
Then the three of us will be together.

1016
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,440
But now I’m a bit suspicious of his identity.

1017
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,000
I don’t care.

1018
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,080
You don’t have to suspect him.

1019
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,320
Because when he was pulled down in the first round,

1020
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,440
I called for his help.

1021
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,920
He didn’t help.
I think that’s suspicious.

1022
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,400
You pulled, but I was already down.

1023
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,960
You were already down.
You could have helped me.

1024
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
How about the three of us give it a try?

1025
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
Or maybe you three can try it.
This is my answer.

1026
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Okay.
Sure.

1027
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Then actually, the three of us are more likely.

1028
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Then it’s just the three of us.

1029
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,920
Now it’s those three.

1030
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,080
There doesn’t seem to be that much suspicion.

1031
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,920
Just everyone.

1032
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,360
The three of us will try, okay?

1033
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
I think you really seem like a good person.

1034
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,080
Okay.
Let’s try one round first and then talk.

1035
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,160
Hurry up and go.
I don’t care.
Go quickly.

1036
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,840
Which three of us?

1037
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,800
Hurry up.
The three of us.

1038
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, do you agree?

1039
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,080
Why?
Go.

1040
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,240
Why?

1041
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
I just changed my vote.

1042
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
Okay, go ahead, you say it.

1043
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,400
Alright, then you go ahead.

1044
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,520
So what combination do you want to go with?

1045
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,880
I think...

1046
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,680
As for Ning, my opinion of him has changed.

1047
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
I’m considering who the other good person is.

1048
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,880
Which of the four is more certain?

1049
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,440
Who do you think it is? Who’s the third good person?

1050
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
I would think it's you.

1051
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,440
So you want the three of us to try?

1052
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,040
Yes.

1053
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,720
What are you doing?

1054
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay.

1055
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm fine with anything. The two of us.

1056
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,040
It's just that my vote changed just now.

1057
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,120
I said my opinion of Ning has changed.

1058
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,440
Alright, I think so too.

1059
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,199
The four of us seem like good people.

1060
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,080
So the four of us

1061
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,679
can probably do anything and it'll be fine.

1062
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,639
No, if you put it that way,

1063
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,360
that means those two are definitely the bad guys.

1064
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,120
We can't say for sure who's definitely bad right now.

1065
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,880
We can only eliminate possibilities.

1066
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,840
And say who we personally trust as good.

1067
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,360
Then take the good people to try.

1068
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,120
The chances of winning are higher that way.

1069
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,159
Is it really like that?

1070
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,960
Then let's go.

1071
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,840
Wait a moment.

1072
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,280
You guys.
You two.

1073
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,120
Time.

1074
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,880
There's still...
There's still ten minutes, ten minutes.

1075
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,719
Hurry up, get up quickly.

1076
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,920
You... you all.
Isn't it the three of you?

1077
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,840
In the end, you two.

1078
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,760
Can you talk a bit more?

1079
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,560
Say anything, whatever.

1080
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,520
I just think the three of us should go try.

1081
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,600
That's what I think.

1082
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
I think the three of us are fine.

1083
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,320
The three of us

1084
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I have a question

1085
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,120
For example, let's suppose, just in case

1086
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,040
if the three of us go out
and one of us is "She"

1087
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
can you be sure among the three of us

1088
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,360
who is "She"?
That's the question

1089
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,400
Come on

1090
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
That's the question

1091
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,040
So you have to
Let me say something

1092
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't overthink this
Don't overthink this round

1093
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,920
Let's just do our best

1094
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,240
Because we've already analyzed it

1095
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,680
We've already gained something

1096
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,160
Even if you three figure it out

1097
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,960
we'll figure it out too

1098
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,440
We can still choose

1099
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,840
So go ahead and try boldly

1100
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,800
Go with your first instinct, bro
Come on, let's go

1101
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,680
The three of us
Don't say anything

1102
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,760
Don't say anything

1103
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,320
Let's just go with our gut feeling

1104
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,120
Go

1105
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,680
Cast a vote

1106
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,200
Come on

1107
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,680
Three

1108
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,800
Two

1109
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,640
There's power.
It's done.

1110
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Already done.

1111
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,120
Let's go.

1112
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,240
So one of you is She.

1113
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,400
We have She among us.

1114
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,440
There's She.

1115
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,160
Bro.

1116
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,480
It's you.

1117
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,200
Then let's try again with Zhang Linghe.

1118
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,640
Is that okay?

1119
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,680
Okay.

1120
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,680
No, why?

1121
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,640
Let's try again with Zhang Linghe.

1122
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,600
If both rounds are the same,

1123
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm willing.

1124
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,120
We pick two out of four.

1125
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
No.

1126
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,480
You guys now...
We'll take He.

1127
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,480
We pick two out of four.

1128
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,720
That's still better than picking two out of six.

1129
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,320
Right?
Right.

1130
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,760
Isn't it?
Let's go.

1131
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,680
Okay, sure.

1132
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,080
You're not She, are you?

1133
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
I'm not.

1134
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,240
There's power.

1135
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,600
Okay.

1136
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,880
Okay.

1137
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
That was me.

1138
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
Then I'm She.

1139
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,720
Jin and He.

1140
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,840
Jin and the two of us.

1141
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Doesn't this make it harder?

1142
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
Wait, I probably...

1143
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,600
Let me ask you this.
If you're not the bad guy,

1144
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,760
which one of us would you choose?

1145
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm a bit unsure.

1146
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
You're playing so well.

1147
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
Now you're not sure about me.

1148
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,520
I just had one...
Because if I'm being honest,

1149
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,480
If it's between you two, I think it's you.

1150
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,240
But how could I...

1151
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,040
Why have you been with me the whole time?

1152
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,520
And there's always been power?

1153
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,640
Because of the three people in the first round

1154
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,520
I said

1155
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,440
if the three of us went to try

1156
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
and it turned out there was She

1157
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm very sure She is him

1158
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
That was my thought at the time

1159
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,560
because I was already conflicted
You replaced him

1160
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,040
Yes, I replaced him

1161
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,120
because I thought you were definitely a good person

1162
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080
Your state was really good

1163
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
So I thought if the three of us went

1164
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,240
it would definitely be clean

1165
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,280
But among the three of us

1166
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,560
there was still She

1167
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,600
And just now, he
like this

1168
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,680
she went

1169
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,800
in the rotation group

1170
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,560
you went

1171
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
you went
Yes

1172
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,240
to test the iris

1173
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
Go try the iris scan.

1174
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,920
The other She.

1175
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
It's between you two.

1176
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
I don't dare let you lead me anymore.
Go try it.

1177
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,440
It's really not me.

1178
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
Don't waste this opportunity.

1179
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,320
It's really not me.

1180
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,680
I really can't let you lead me again.

1181
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,520
Bro.

1182
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,720
There was power in the first round, and there was She.

1183
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,360
I really can't let you lead me.
Is he She?

1184
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,800
I'm not sure anymore.

1185
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,680
Because I'm a good person.

1186
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,960
You don't seem like a good person.
Because...

1187
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm scared of you now.
Come, listen to me.

1188
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,200
You don't seem like a good person.

1189
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,840
Wait a second, everyone.

1190
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,040
Three minutes left.

1191
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,760
Hurry up.

1192
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,920
Hurry up.

1193
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,840
In my heart, Ba is always that something.

1194
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
Ba is always one of them.

1195
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,840
Because Ba was there at the time.

1196
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
When putting together that puzzle piece.

1197
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,720
You kept getting it wrong.

1198
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Where is this?

1199
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm turning it clockwise, clockwise.

1200
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,080
Left side, it's on the left.

1201
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,480
No, clockwise, baby.

1202
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,240
How much time is left?
Time's up.

1203
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,080
I didn't get it wrong.

1204
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,200
It will stick.

1205
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
I think Bai and Ba should go try now.

1206
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,520
Bai, Ba.

1207
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
I agree with Bai and Ba too.

1208
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,320
Bai and Ba.

1209
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,600
Why not you?

1210
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,280
Who am I with?
Don't rush.

1211
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,240
Vote, stop arguing.

1212
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,120
Stop arguing.

1213
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,800
Guys, vote.

1214
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,480
You just ended up with Ba, right?

1215
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,520
No.

1216
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,280
Vote.
Let's vote, okay?

1217
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,520
Stop arguing.
Hurry.

1218
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,040
It's about to explode.

1219
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,400
You two are voting for us now.

1220
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,320
Yes.
Jin and Ning, go.

1221
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,240
I vote for you two, you go try.

1222
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,200
You have the most votes.

1223
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,640
Jin and Ning, go.

1224
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,600
Jin and Ning, go try.
I've finished voting.

1225
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,480
I have Ning.

1226
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,520
I don't know who the other one is.

1227
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,000
You two have to comply.

1228
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,760
Minority obeys the majority now.

1229
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,480
Hurry up.

1230
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,000
It's about to explode.

1231
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,440
Let's go.
Okay.

1232
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,520
Jin and Ning, go.
Okay, come on.

1233
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
Go quickly.
Come on, try it.

1234
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,880
Hurry up.

1235
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,240
Forty seconds.
Today, you...

1236
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,000
If you really lied to me,

1237
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll really hate you for the rest of my life.

1238
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm telling you,

1239
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
It's Bai Yu, I'm telling you.

1240
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,640
I've already figured it out.

1241
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
I need to move over a bit.

1242
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
It might explode in a moment.

1243
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,600
I think it's you.

1244
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,760
You're laughing so happily.

1245
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,800
It's not me.

1246
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,040
It's you two.

1247
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,880
No way.

1248
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,840
Failed to identify the culprit.

1249
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,760
No way.

1250
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,360
Verification failed.

1251
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,880
Unbelievable.

1252
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,760
Iris verification failed.

1253
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
Bomb number one activated.

1254
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,880
A random location will be detonated.

1255
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,760
It's you.

1256
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,800
You two.

1257
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
You kept putting me in front the whole time.

1258
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,480
Sorry.

1259
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,680
Let's go try it.

1260
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,040
Really.
Sorry.

1261
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
Okay, the two of us will go try.

1262
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,240
I was apologizing to you two.

1263
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,840
I was saying sorry to both of you.

1264
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
I heard it, because you're She.

1265
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
You're definitely She.

1266
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,560
Why?
Dear.

1267
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
Because you can't help but laugh right now.

1268
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,280
Your mouth is all curled up.
Really?

1269
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,000
Because you played it so well.

1270
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,560
Then let's keep guessing, okay?

1271
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Okay.

1272
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,760
Let's see how smart we are.

1273
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,640
I really can't take it anymore.

1274
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,760
We haven't tried yet.

1275
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
About She, I think...

1276
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm begging you.

1277
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,440
Please, let me try.

1278
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,120
I really need to know who She is.

1279
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,200
This is very important to me.

1280
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,760
Boss.

1281
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,160
Boss.

1282
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
You guys are amazing.

1283
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
Leave the remaining four to us.

1284
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,080
Take them out.

1285
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,720
Lock them in the office.

1286
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,240
Yes.

1287
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
Take out those four.

1288
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,920
Take them out.

1289
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,560
Mr. She's consciousness is split in two.

1290
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,520
You have another companion.

1291
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,800
It's the person who chose the orange paper figure.

1292
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,280
Mr. She's plan left two clues.

1293
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,320
As long as you manage to

1294
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,240
have the clue destroyed once,

1295
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,080
and keep it hidden until the end, you can get the golden key.

1296
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,800
Stop or delay the others' actions.

1297
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,120
While others are completing their tasks,

1298
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,320
secretly sabotage them.

1299
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
I've already come down.

1300
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,800
You're down now, you can help me.

1301
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,400
Go stop them.

1302
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,520
We can help them.

1303
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Help me.

1304
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,040
Don't rush.

1305
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,680
The two of us are...

1306
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,680
The two of us are carrying it.

1307
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,240
Where is it?

1308
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,320
Two.

1309
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,840
Who should take it? Should I?

1310
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,880
Who is (turning) doing what?

1311
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,480
Bai

1312
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,680
Me? Is it me?

1313
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,440
The two of us were dragged along by you.

1314
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,640
It wasn't me.

1315
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,560
Wait a moment.

1316
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,200
Just now She was causing trouble.

1317
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,400
Who is causing trouble?

1318
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,280
Who did you just think was causing trouble?

1319
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Zhang Linghe

1320
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,680
I had no idea where you all were going the whole time.

1321
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
I am She.

1322
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,440
You are S(he).

1323
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,280
You are Cow.

1324
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,400
Let us go.

1325
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm angry.

1326
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,360
I want revenge.

1327
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
You want revenge.

1328
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,160
Yes, me.

1329
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,280
That's She’s father.

1330
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,880
Really?

1331
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,280
If

1332
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,160
Let me go along with what you said.
Okay.

1333
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,680
Only good people would be afraid to say it.

1334
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,120
Wait a second.
I'm not sure.

1335
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,560
Yes.

1336
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,520
Yes.

1337
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
Except for yourself.

1338
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,960
You know you’re a good person.

1339
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,560
Yes.

1340
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,880
First impression, bro.
Come on, let's go.

1341
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,720
The three of us.

1342
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,600
So one of you is She.

1343
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,760
We have She among us.

1344
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,800
There is She.

1345
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,480
Bro.

1346
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,800
It's you.

1347
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,960
Choosing two out of four is better than two out of six.

1348
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,600
Right?
Right.

1349
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,040
Isn't it?
Let's go.

1350
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,200
The three of us.
Yeah.

1351
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,720
Why

1352
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,840
I just changed my vote

1353
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,480
It's been two minutes, vote

1354
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,080
Vote

1355
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,520
Just vote, stop arguing

1356
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,560
Stop arguing

1357
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,240
Guys, vote

1358
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,000
She goes
In the rotation group

1359
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,560
Jin and Ning go

1360
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,760
I vote for you two, you two go try

1361
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,480
You have the most votes

1362
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,480
Boss
We're here

1363
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,400
Very good

1364
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,480
Right across from headquarters

1365
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,840
We've prepared a celebration banquet for you

1366
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,200
Okay

1367
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
We can go eat first

1368
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,640
Alright
Boss

1369
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,040
Please

1370
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,320
You four

1371
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,400
Goodbye

1372
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
Let me bow to you

1373
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,680
Why bow
We're both the boss

1374
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,800
Feels good

1375
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,240
Lock them in the office

1376
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,440
I think he's clean too

1377
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,400
The three of us will try, okay

1378
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,960
I think you seem like a good person

1379
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,240
You're not She, are you

1380
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm not

1381
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,840
This is really too hard.

1382
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,960
He just wouldn't get up earlier.

1383
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,080
Because at first, I thought the three of you would go over.

1384
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,240
When the three of us went over,

1385
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,040
he just kept sitting there.

1386
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,960
He said, "Wait, I don't get it."

1387
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,440
Wait, I don't get it.

1388
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,800
He just sat there on the bench.

1389
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I told him, "Go on!"

1390
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,440
He still said, "Wait."

1391
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,120
Hurry up and go.

1392
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,280
Get up already.

1393
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,360
Aren't you three supposed to go?

1394
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,080
Just you, go ahead.

1395
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,760
Why?

1396
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,560
I just changed my vote.

1397
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,760
Wait, I don't get it.

1398
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,120
Just sitting there on the bench.

1399
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,920
Poor good people.

1400
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,680
Let's comfort each other now.

1401
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,480
Let's not hurt each other anymore.

1402
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,640
Let's comfort each other.

1403
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,960
Oh no, oh no.

1404
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,560
How did you guys get locked up?
Why did the magic stop working?

1405
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,960
It's okay.

1406
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,600
I found a way to drive She away.

1407
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,920
Flick hard the person controlled by Mr. She

1408
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,120
on the forehead.

1409
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,880
That will drive away She's consciousness.

1410
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,960
You guys hurry up and go.

1411
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,040
Forehead? Whose forehead?

1412
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,400
She's forehead.

1413
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,760
These two people.
These two.

1414
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,120
We have to find those two first.

1415
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,360
Come on, let's go.

1416
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,920
We should be able to get out through this window.

1417
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,720
It's this window.

1418
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,000
What is this supposed to be?

1419
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,400
Okay.
It can be opened.

1420
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,560
It can be pulled open.

1421
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,720
Come on, let's go.

1422
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,160
Come on, boss, after you.

1423
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Alright, boss.
Take your time eating.

1424
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,720
I'll take the guys and head out first.

1425
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,320
Alright.
Goodbye, boss.

1426
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,240
Go get the whip and hit them.

1427
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,200
Alright, let's go.

1428
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,920
Hello.

1429
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,680
Hi.

1430
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,960
Please have a seat first.

1431
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,400
Okay.
Eat first.

1432
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,520
Have a few bites.

1433
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,640
Let me know if you need anything.

1434
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,320
Alright.

1435
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,840
Should we go back?

1436
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,440
See what they're doing.

1437
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,280
Xiao Ba, you saw how foolish I was.

1438
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,800
And you didn't stop me.

1439
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,080
Because everyone was already suspicious of me.

1440
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,200
So I said the three of us should go first.

1441
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,640
Couldn't you use a true love's kiss

1442
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,920
to wake me up?

1443
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,040
If this happens again,

1444
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,400
run.

1445
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,640
Go beat them up for me.

1446
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,280
Hit them for me.

1447
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,400
Hit.

1448
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,160
Put it on me.

1449
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,400
I'm ready to fight.

1450
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,320
No, it's okay.

1451
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,520
Zhang Linghe.

1452
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,720
Ning, have a seat.

1453
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,440
Can I flick the arm?

1454
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,720
What do you mean by flicking the arm?

1455
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,960
They want to flick the forehead.

1456
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,080
I think flicking the forehead isn't painful enough.

1457
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,400
What's this task for?

1458
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,240
Flick him.
We need you.

1459
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,240
Flick the "She" out of your bodies.

1460
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,040
Don't flick.

1461
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,400
Then we'll keep it.

1462
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,440
No, I want my real brother back.

1463
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,760
This bad brother isn't mine.

1464
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,080
Who will hit him?

1465
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,880
Come on, let me flick you.

1466
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,120
Go ahead.

1467
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,400
You're not even using any force.

1468
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,560
I don't feel anything.

1469
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,160
Really?

1470
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,960
I don't feel anything.

1471
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,000
No feeling.

1472
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,000
I don't feel anything.
No feeling.

1473
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,440
I don't feel anything.
No feeling.

1474
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,760
I don't feel anything.
No feeling.

1475
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,840
Come.
Give me your hand.

1476
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,560
I'm on your side now.

1477
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,760
No.

1478
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,560
Hit hard.

1479
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,600
Use force.

1480
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Use extra force.

1481
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,000
It's okay, come here.

1482
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,600
They've already been punished.

1483
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,480
She's lost consciousness.

1484
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,520
Then how do we know where the bomb is?

1485
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,280
What is this?

1486
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,280
Describe and act it out in Cantonese.

1487
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,480
Let the restaurant owner guess the answer.

1488
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
That counts as a successful challenge.

1489
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,280
Restaurant owner.
What's the matter?

1490
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,160
Can we play a game with you?

1491
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,600
Sure.
There are a total of

1492
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,720
eleven characters.

1493
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,320
The first character is

1494
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,200
another meaning of "tong".

1495
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,200
And.
That's right.

1496
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,920
Okay.
The second character.

1497
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,720
Archery
Shoot

1498
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,240
Yes

1499
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,520
The third character

1500
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,240
Cow
Yes

1501
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,960
The fourth character

1502
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,760
One

1503
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,520
The fifth character

1504
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,160
Sit down and stand up

1505
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,080
Get up
Yes

1506
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,680
The two of us are here

1507
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,240
Playing

1508
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,000
The last five characters

1509
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,600
Come play

1510
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,480
Nothing

1511
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,920
What kind of person is he

1512
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,960
Introverts and extroverts

1513
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,760
But

1514
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,520
Come

1515
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,600
Play with the social butterfly

1516
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,960
Introverts become extroverts

1517
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,320
So smart

1518
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,760
That means we are too

1519
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,520
"Potential stock"

1520
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,040
Then I'm just an "attention seeker"

1521
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,640
Coca-Cola sharing bottle

1522
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,280
Multiple personalities launched

1523
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,560
Have fun with the Coca-Cola sharing bottle

1524
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,720
Let's have fun together and happily recommend

1525
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,920
Come on, cheers

1526
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,520
Thank you.

1527
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,520
This is the secret recipe.

1528
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,560
You just need to dab a little on your forehead.

1529
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,080
You'll recover in an hour.

1530
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,200
She still has some lingering memories.

1531
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,040
You guys try it out.

1532
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,840
I'll go prepare the food.
Okay.

1533
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,760
You put it on me.

1534
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,080
Wait, don't.

1535
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,840
You don't need to use it, right?

1536
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,200
Okay, it's done.

1537
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,840
The two of them already did it themselves.

1538
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,680
Let's eat first.

1539
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,920
Wait for their memories to come back.

1540
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,480
Alright.

1541
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,360
Wait, just now you...

1542
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,560
Didn't you already eat?

1543
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,200
I wasn't full.

1544
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
Or maybe take real action, right.

1545
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,120
Like this.

1546
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
In a bit, you two sinners

1547
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,720
will carry the two ladies forward.

1548
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,080
For all the next steps, you have to carry them.

1549
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,200
They're not allowed to walk a single step.

1550
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,000
Work a little harder.

1551
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,720
Alright?

1552
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,640
You can atone for your sins.

1553
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,280
It's fine.

1554
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,640
Bro, you said carrying you is fine.

1555
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,760
I carried for a while.

1556
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,640
I won't be polite with you.

1557
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,480
I feel like I ate something.

1558
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,320
Some of She's memories are still lingering.

1559
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,440
I just remembered something.

1560
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,440
Before She left,

1561
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,680
he said he would hide this

1562
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,680
bomb remote control

1563
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,000
in the city gate archway

1564
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,840
and the location on the map.

1565
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,640
After you expelled She's consciousness just now,

1566
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,120
he transferred to someone else.

1567
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
You need to find him as soon as possible.

1568
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,800
First, send him back to the 22nd century.

1569
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,480
So he can't update

1570
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
the bomb remote control's timer in real time.

1571
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
Then go find and disable

1572
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,240
the bomb remote control.

1573
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
Only then can you resolve the current crisis in Tui City.

1574
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,600
She's consciousness has already been transferred.

1575
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,480
So it's not among us.
Not among us.

1576
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,680
That's right.

1577
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,720
I'll give you two tools.

1578
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,600
One can help you locate him.

1579
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,520
This is a route.

1580
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,400
Another one can send his consciousness

1581
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,840
back to the 22nd century

1582
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,320
It can only be used once

1583
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,840
to send a person back to the 22nd century

1584
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,360
Let's go

1585
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,080
Let's go to Haoju Haosan Shop

1586
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,960
So beautiful
Wait a second

1587
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,400
What is this

1588
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,320
Is this for that ritual

1589
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,960
What do these mean

1590
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,160
Let's go, hurry up

1591
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,960
Quick, look for it, go

1592
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,760
Hurry

1593
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,320
Faster

1594
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,680
You hit him in a bit

1595
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,200
No
I'm afraid I won't hit him

1596
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,440
You can do it
You hit him

1597
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,800
I believe in you

1598
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,280
Haoju Haosan

1599
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,160
Haoju Haosan Shop

1600
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,920
These people are very suspicious.

1601
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,240
One of these people should be the one.

1602
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:09,760
She.

1603
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,200
The one fanning herself.

1604
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,200
Who are you?

1605
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,000
Is there something you need?

1606
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,920
These are all your employees, right?

1607
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,400
Yes, I'm moving my shop today.

1608
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,760
These are all workers I hired.

1609
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,720
Is there anyone

1610
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,840
who suddenly started acting strange just now?

1611
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,560
That's right.

1612
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,520
All these people are workers I hired.

1613
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,360
I gathered them.

1614
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,920
I don't know all of them.

1615
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,280
They just came here to make some money.

1616
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,800
So what are their names?

1617
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,560
You don't know?
I don't know them.

1618
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,640
Then how do you communicate with them?

1619
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,360
I just...

1620
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,920
Yeah.

1621
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,680
That boy

1622
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,200
That's him
An Wenzhe

1623
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,640
Where

1624
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,880
Th-this

1625
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,280
An Wenzhe

1626
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,760
What are you doing

1627
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,360
You can't leave
Boss

1628
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,120
Boss

1629
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,240
Boss

1630
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,640
We'll buy all the umbrellas you have

1631
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,520
Take off his mask

1632
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,080
Okay, we'll give it to him

1633
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,800
An Wenzhe

1634
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,200
Are you sure it's him

1635
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,920
We just passed a path full of flowers

1636
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,560
She passed by too

1637
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,280
Look at his feet

1638
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,520
There is

1639
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,480
Then he has it too.

1640
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:03,680
This one has it as well.
They all have it.

1641
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,680
How about this, then?

1642
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,200
You all investigate thoroughly.

1643
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,080
I don't want to use anyone with an unclear background either.

1644
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,320
Alright.

1645
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:12,920
Okay.
Come on, brothers.

1646
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,680
Come, line up in two rows first.

1647
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Let's take a look first.

1648
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,040
Brother, please lift your foot so we can check the sole.

1649
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:22,960
This one has it too.
Alright.

1650
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,520
Come on, lift your left foot.

1651
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,000
Nothing.

1652
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,320
Right foot up.

1653
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Alright, go back to work.

1654
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,680
Brother, nothing else here.

1655
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,240
Get some good rest.

1656
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,160
What are you doing?

1657
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,680
Come on, left foot up.

1658
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,360
Come on, right foot up.

1659
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,600
Alright, you two go have some tea.

1660
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,800
Come on, go take a seat.

1661
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,560
Find a place to rest.
You don't need to check anymore.

1662
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Come on, brother.

1663
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,680
Left foot up.

1664
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,200
Come on, right foot up.

1665
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,360
Alright, you three go rest over there.

1666
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,360
This way.

1667
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,520
Her expression.

1668
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,960
Come on, left foot up.

1669
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,560
Come on, right foot up.

1670
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,960
Teacher, this way.

1671
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,600
Come on, left foot up.

1672
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,760
There's something wrong with this person.

1673
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,240
Lift your right foot.

1674
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,280
Yes.

1675
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,640
Stay here for me.

1676
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,680
Come on, lift your left foot.

1677
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,640
No.

1678
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,960
Come on, lift your right foot.

1679
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,720
Come on, lift your left foot.

1680
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,320
Come on, right foot.

1681
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,200
Go ahead.
Okay, come on.

1682
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,440
You three, go stand over there.

1683
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,160
One She can only be used on two people.

1684
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Now there are three.
That's right.

1685
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,040
Thank you for your hard work, teachers.

1686
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,400
Take off that mask.

1687
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,200
Okay?

1688
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,000
Let's take a look at their faces to see who it is.

1689
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,640
Beard

1690
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,760
We've met.

1691
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,400
I am the director with ten billion in box office sales.

1692
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,640
Nominate the ten-billion director.

1693
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,640
We should have met him too, right?

1694
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,880
He is the Great-Grandfather of the Good family.

1695
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,960
I am the Great-Grandfather of the Good family.

1696
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,440
Great-Grandfather Good

1697
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,040
Nominate Great-Grandfather.

1698
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,520
Yes.

1699
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,640
So all three of them were resurrected by She.

1700
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,480
Alright, come on.

1701
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,080
I'll give you one last chance.

1702
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,440
Who was just suddenly possessed by She?

1703
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,320
That's so scary.

1704
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,680
You look more like you were possessed by She.

1705
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,400
The way you are now.

1706
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,760
Me.

1707
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm a good person who was tricked by She.

1708
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
She

1709
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,720
You already embarrassed me just now.

1710
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,400
I'll give you another chance.

1711
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,800
Come out on your own, obediently.

1712
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,920
Like this.

1713
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,440
See, as soon as I make a fuss,
my brother will come out.

1714
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,200
What time did you get here?

1715
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,240
The umbrella shop owner called me over.

1716
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,080
Then we said we were coming to move some things.

1717
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,360
What were you doing at two o'clock?

1718
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,160
I usually like a bit of

1719
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,200
artistic hobbies.

1720
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,280
So I write calligraphy and paint.

1721
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,200
Where are your calligraphy and paintings?

1722
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,120
Speaking of that,

1723
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,560
I wrote a piece of calligraphy today.

1724
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,280
But I didn't have time to mount it.

1725
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,800
Let's take a look, come on.

1726
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,240
Write the exact same thing again.

1727
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,840
If you can't reproduce it now,

1728
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
then you're a liar.

1729
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,240
I'll shoot.

1730
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,200
There's still music coming from Liuxing Street,

1731
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,480
is it the sound of a bayan accordion?

1732
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,320
Alexander's bakery,

1733
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,720
has the rye bread come out of the oven?

1734
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,400
Is this a song?

1735
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,360
Alexander's bakery,

1736
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,120
this is the right flavor.

1737
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,560
We sang it on the first day.

1738
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,720
I want to send you my endless longing.

1739
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,360
Alright, what about you?

1740
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,160
What were you doing at two o'clock?

1741
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,640
Cooking.

1742
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,680
Bring out your food, let me have a bite.

1743
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,360
No, I mean, what were you cooking?

1744
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,000
Chopping dumplings.

1745
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,280
Chopping dumplings?

1746
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,360
Those are two very amateurish things to say.

1747
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,240
Making dumplings, chopping dumplings.

1748
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,880
He seems like his consciousness just arrived

1749
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,840
in a new host.
Yeah.

1750
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,080
His mouth isn't fully under control yet, right?

1751
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,600
That's right.

1752
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,880
What were you doing at two o'clock?

1753
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,000
I was carving jade.

1754
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,240
If you're a jade carver,

1755
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,040
your hands would have a lot of calluses.

1756
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,360
Take off their gloves.

1757
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,560
I think they should take them off.

1758
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,440
Do your hands look like a jade carver's, man?

1759
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:47,920
Which hand?
So smooth.

1760
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,520
Which hand do you usually use to carve jade?

1761
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,440
I use my right hand.

1762
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,160
Which hand do you usually use to cook?

1763
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,880
My left hand.

1764
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,520
Which hand do you usually use to write?

1765
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,480
My right hand.
It's him.

1766
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
It's the left-handed person.
Why?

1767
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,080
Because that guy, She,

1768
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
is used to using his left hand.

1769
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,400
Who said that?

1770
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,920
In that office.

1771
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,040
Yes.

1772
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:15,800
Yes.

1773
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,480
You didn't mishear.
Who cooks with their left hand?

1774
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:21,960
I cook with my right hand.
You just said left hand.

1775
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,520
You said left hand just now.

1776
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,880
You think we're fools.

1777
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,720
Come on, play it back.

1778
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,440
Which hand do you usually use to cook?

1779
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,280
Left hand.

1780
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,040
Alright, it's you.

1781
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,880
I'll shoot you.

1782
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,320
I'll shoot you.

1783
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,280
Don't move.

1784
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,120
Don't move.

1785
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,280
You think only you have guns?

1786
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,000
You all better think carefully.

1787
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,160
Why do you think I'm doing all this?

1788
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,040
To help humanity, right?

1789
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,680
Then don't you think
they should die?

1790
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,800
If you think so too,
then why are you stopping me?

1791
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,240
We just want to find you.

1792
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,960
And give you a big hug.

1793
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,600
Hold you tight.

1794
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,800
Do you know what kind of life we live in 2125?

1795
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,080
It's dark and cold there.

1796
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,800
We never see the sun.

1797
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,360
There are catastrophic famines everywhere.

1798
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,120
But who caused all this?

1799
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,240
Wasn't it all their doing?

1800
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,120
We even sent our last hope,

1801
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,480
our children,

1802
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,040
back here.

1803
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,280
We hoped to change them,

1804
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,480
to change the future.

1805
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,360
And what happened?

1806
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,680
Your child was still killed.

1807
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,480
That's right.

1808
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,920
My daughter died.

1809
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,320
She was just an ordinary

1810
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,360
and very cute little girl.

1811
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,000
My daughter was beaten to death.

1812
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,080
What did she do wrong?

1813
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,880
We have ways to deal with natural disasters.

1814
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,960
We can unite together

1815
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,320
to resist them.

1816
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,000
But what about man-made disasters?

1817
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,600
What should we do then?

1818
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,800
But those two people were punished by you as well,

1819
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,120
weren't they?

1820
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,320
Was that punishment enough?

1821
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,040
You can punish those two

1822
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,200
who caused your daughter's death,

1823
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,960
but taking everyone's lives

1824
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,120
is not your right.

1825
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Well said.

1826
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,880
Let me tell you all,

1827
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,280
nothing here will end.

1828
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,400
Even if you stop me this time,

1829
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,080
this world

1830
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,400
will still get worse little by little.

1831
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,200
Everything will still happen again.

1832
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,080
Everything will keep repeating.

1833
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,920
Stop him.

1834
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,120
Why are you treating him like this?

1835
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,200
Is he a bad person?

1836
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:03,920
He is a bad person.

1837
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,400
Then let's carry him out first.

1838
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:06,920
Let's go.

1839
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,760
Here, give him to me.

1840
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,440
He's too evil.

1841
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
Sent him two hundred years further.

1842
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,880
Gave him two more shots.
That's true.

1843
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,440
He went to the year 2325.

1844
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,000
Someone who definitely knows when to fire extra shots.

1845
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,720
So at this moment,

1846
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,840
we need to go back and find something.

1847
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,240
Right?
Find the bomb.

1848
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,280
That's right.
But there's a problem.

1849
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,520
Come here, quickly.

1850
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,040
What's wrong?
Come here, quickly.

1851
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,480
Hurry up.
What's wrong?

1852
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,200
Hurry up.

1853
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,000
Everyone, spread out a bit.

1854
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,920
Look up there.

1855
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,480
What are you looking at?
Look at the camera.

1856
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:41,960
It stopped.

1857
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,000
Come on.

1858
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,440
I thought it was something else.
Come here.

1859
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,680
Turn around, okay?

1860
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,120
Everyone suddenly looks up like this.

1861
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,880
It's that feeling of sudden realization.

1862
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,680
Just as an example, I get it.

1863
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,760
Like, you're over there, that kind of thing.

1864
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,760
So, let's talk about a topic.

1865
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,280
Do you know where to look?

1866
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,120
Three, two, one.
Right.

1867
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,440
That's what it looks like, right?

1868
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:55,960
Yeah.
Come on.

1869
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,440
So where should we look now?
We've been searching all day.

1870
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,440
I'm so tired.

1871
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,280
Where exactly are we going?

1872
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,240
Okay.

1873
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,320
Let's go.
Look for the bomb.

1874
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,720
Hurry.

1875
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,600
The bomb's remote is hidden in

1876
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,680
the city gate passage.

1877
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,280
Yes.

1878
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,640
Now She has already

1879
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,520
been sent back by us.
Next, we need to hurry to

1880
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,920
the south gate tower to find the bomb.

1881
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,560
Will it be there?

1882
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,840
It's possible.

1883
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:24,920
Yes.

1884
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,280
One of the remotes is at

1885
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,240
Haoju Hao Umbrella Shop.

1886
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,480
Found it.

1887
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:39,880
Where is it?

1888
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:45,760
Bomb

1889
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,400
Five-minute countdown

1890
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,520
After the countdown ends

1891
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,000
The bomb will explode immediately

1892
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,480
Cut the wires in a specific order

1893
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,680
to stop the bomb from detonating

1894
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:58,920
Take this, then

1895
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,200
Come on, strong guy

1896
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Let me carry it
I need to atone

1897
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,160
You should take it
Atonement

1898
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,320
Let's go to the south city gate tower now

1899
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,120
to find another bomb
Okay

1900
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,400
There's not much time left
We have to do it this way

1901
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,520
Hurry
Go

1902
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,760
Hurry, a little faster
Hurry

1903
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,360
So it's right here

1904
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,720
Outside, go out

1905
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,760
Isn't this the city gate tower?

1906
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,640
This

1907
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,200
Look for the remote here

1908
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,800
How do we find it?

1909
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,920
It's such a large area

1910
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,880
He said he would hide the remote for the bomb

1911
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,560
in the city gate passage.

1912
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,160
The passage under the city tower.

1913
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,400
He said

1914
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,720
He meant the passage under the city tower.

1915
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,120
The passage, right.

1916
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,320
The passage.

1917
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,520
Then it should be here.

1918
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,760
There's a hole in the door here.

1919
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,560
Behind the door, check behind the door.

1920
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Here.

1921
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,040
Thirty-six seconds left.

1922
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,040
Hurry.

1923
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,400
Quick.
We have to cut it.

1924
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,440
This one needs to be cut.

1925
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:08,920
Here.
Hurry, cut it.

1926
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,080
What about the order?

1927
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,360
This one.
Look at the words.

1928
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,480
If you cut the wires in the correct order,

1929
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,240
the bomb can be stopped from exploding.

1930
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,440
What color is Room 1?

1931
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:22,920
Paper figure.

1932
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,080
Right.

1933
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,640
Room 1 is purple.

1934
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,080
Room 2 is red.

1935
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,000
Here.
This one.

1936
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,840
Room 3 is green.

1937
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,280
Room 4 is yellow.

1938
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,360
Blue.

1939
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,240
Okay.

1940
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,600
This one is done.

1941
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,960
So what I said about the paper figure earlier was wrong?

1942
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,000
This one?

1943
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,080
Is this some kind of map?

1944
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,920
It's the city tower.
It's the lights on the city tower.

1945
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,600
Four, five, and there's six on top.

1946
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,360
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1947
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,880
What color is number one?

1948
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,720
There's no number one here.

1949
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,880
Mine starts from four.

1950
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,000
At the back.
There are more at the back.

1951
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
Number one is over there.

1952
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,520
Number one is over there, it's purple.

1953
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:50,920
I see it.

1954
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,800
Number two, the tall one, look at number two.

1955
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,240
Number two is blue.

1956
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,120
Number two is blue.

1957
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,840
Okay, cut it.

1958
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,000
Number one is purple.

1959
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,120
Number two is blue.
Blue.

1960
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,040
Number three is green.
Number four is red.

1961
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,160
Number five is white.
Number six is yellow.

1962
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,000
Number six is yellow.

1963
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,399
It didn't explode, right?
It didn't explode.

1964
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:34,279
Then that's right.

1965
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:34,960
Right?

1966
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:38,040
At least we saved a group of people.

1967
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,960
So beautiful.

1968
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,680
So pretty.

1969
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,279
Okay.

1970
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,479
Is this one an explosive?

1971
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,319
This one isn't an explosive.
This is...

1972
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,520
A celebratory firework.

1973
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,960
A victory celebration firework.

1974
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:10,600
Yes.

1975
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:12,359
So beautiful.

1976
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,920
Eyes, the eyes are bright now.

1977
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,960
That's great.

1978
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,279
You finally managed to perfectly

1979
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,640
resolve this crisis.

1980
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,279
With the Special Immigration Bureau

1981
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,640
beginning to operate the Rebirth Immigration Project,

1982
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,240
the reborn citizens of Tui City

1983
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,439
have caused some

1984
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,439
butterfly effect changes to Tui City.
The car is gone.

1985
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,279
The names of these animals have all changed.

1986
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,080
My surname is Lin.

1987
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,120
You can just call me Old Lin.

1988
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,560
Among these reborn individuals,

1989
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,640
Mr. She also slipped in

1990
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,800
as a conspirator.

1991
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,240
To find him

1992
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,560
and stop his plan,

1993
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,600
the Special Immigration Bureau recruited you.

1994
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,920
Your first rebirth

1995
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,640
was on May 10, 2025.

1996
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,400
You were reborn into

1997
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
your own bodies during a team-building event.

1998
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,240
But at that time,

1999
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,720
you were still discovered by She.

2000
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,760
He not only caused an explosion

2001
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,760
that killed your bodies,

2002
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
but also used the "Memory Eraser Bullet"

2003
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,800
to make your consciousness lose its memory as well.

2004
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,400
Do you still remember your mission?

2005
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,400
No, we don't.

2006
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,680
You almost completely forgot

2007
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,520
that you were detectives from the year 2125.

2008
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,240
I can only rely on

2009
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,560
The times and places where She appeared

2010
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,880
let you be reborn again to

2011
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,840
February 25, 2025

2012
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,000
at the Tui Sweet Food Factory

2013
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,440
It was discovered that a mysterious person

2014
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,160
was funding Ning Dengpao to carry out live-streamed killings

2015
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,600
at the Pirate Mansion on March 14

2016
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,840
a mysterious person was found

2017
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,160
who kidnapped Ren Weishan

2018
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,960
forty percent of the wealthy clients

2019
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,120
on April 22

2020
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,640
at Tui Billion Film Company

2021
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,320
She was seen escaping with a box

2022
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,400
at Goodhouse Private on May 8

2023
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,840
Starting at the end of this month

2024
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,280
I will transport to you every month

2025
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,320
six corpses

2026
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
The contact person is

2027
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,440
Ning Dengpao from Tui Sweet Food Factory

2028
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,720
It was found that the mysterious person was She

2029
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,000
Tui Taiye helped him store the corpses

2030
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,280
You were at Tui Sweet Food Factory

2031
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,560
and caused an explosion at Pirate Mansion

2032
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,680
killing so many people

2033
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,280
The explosion was made to obtain corpses

2034
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,520
Yes
And it was discovered

2035
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,560
that the previous explosion

2036
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,000
was also caused by She

2037
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,560
Next

2038
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,640
She was going to complete his new rebirth plan

2039
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,640
Now, he has finally been stopped

2040
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,280
Not only did you save your 2025

2041
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,160
selves
but also saved the entire Tui City

2042
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,840
We did it.

2043
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,120
That's great.

2044
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:21,320
Alright.

2045
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,840
So we can say we've saved this city.

2046
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,440
Really?

2047
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,600
We saved one place, at least.

2048
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,120
At least we saved some people.

2049
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:26,680
Yeah.

2050
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,200
Maintaining world peace.

2051
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,440
And we sent She back.

2052
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:30,800
Right.

2053
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,640
But I think

2054
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,880
the Special Immigration Bureau

2055
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,160
and She both acted wrongly.

2056
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,040
They don't believe

2057
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,480
that people today can save themselves.

2058
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,480
But we believe they can.
Yes.

2059
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,480
Actually, this is a very, very

2060
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,240
thought-provoking concept.

2061
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,360
It's about protecting the environment.

2062
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,080
In recent years,

2063
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,400
we've also seen a lot of extreme environmental events around us.

2064
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,000
Glaciers keep melting.

2065
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,120
Some species are slowly becoming endangered.

2066
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,200
Let's cherish our resources even more.

2067
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,240
Every small action in our daily lives

2068
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,440
Maybe it will all become part of the butterfly effect.

2069
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,160
Environmental protection is not just an issue for the future.

2070
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,080
Nor is it someone else's responsibility.

2071
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,280
It's closely connected to each and every one of us.

2072
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,480
I think in our daily lives, we can

2073
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,440
do our best to protect nature,

2074
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,560
experience nature,

2075
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,760
and cherish our own home.

2076
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,400
At the same time, we're also protecting ourselves.

2077
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,520
As long as each of us starts with what's around us,

2078
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,040
and cares for the environment we live in,

2079
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,000
I believe we can have
a better future.

2080
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,720
Yes.

2081
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,320
We have to say goodbye to Tui City in 2025.

2082
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,280
Say goodbye.

2083
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,800
We're going back to 2125.

2084
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,840
Are we going back to the future?

2085
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,560
Yes.

2086
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
This matter has come to an end for now.

2087
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,960
It's temporarily concluded.

2088
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,360
He said he would come back.

2089
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,440
He said all of this is a cycle.

2090
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,640
So something else might happen in the future.

2091
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,640
Our responsibilities in Tui City in 2025

2092
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,960
have been fulfilled.

2093
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,320
Yes.
That's right.

2094
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,200
We are He Li Mo and Jin Yu

2095
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,840
This is a livestream factory

2096
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,360
But they're a bit sinister

2097
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,200
They don't let them leave

2098
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,840
Looking into each little cubicle

2099
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,040
Everyone is livestreaming

2100
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,920
It feels like what you see isn't

2101
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,840
real, living people

2102
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,360
but rather one by one, they're

2103
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,000
puppets controlled by traffic

2104
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,160
I'll just give you

2105
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,720
the latest flight number of the nine-letter actress

2106
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,520
and send it to you

2107
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,920
That's actually illegal

2108
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,280
Don't think that just because you didn't press that button

2109
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,080
it has nothing to do with you

2110
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,920
If you stand by

2111
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,840
watching

2112
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,000
egging others on

2113
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,040
or participating

2114
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,280
Even if you weren't the one who pressed the button in the end

2115
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,920
you're still responsible

2116
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,440
Don't ignore small good deeds

2117
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,120
Don't do something just because the evil seems small

2118
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,640
Don't think what you did was just a small thing

2119
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,240
It could affect many more lives

2120
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,440
Pushing others forward just to gain immortality

2121
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,640
creates a deadly trap

2122
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,040
His desires only grow

2123
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,320
Greed is like a dagger

2124
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,520
At first, it might just

2125
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,560
nick the edge of morality

2126
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,960
But if left unchecked

2127
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
it will cut deeper and deeper

2128
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,640
The true value of life

2129
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,760
isn't about how many days we've lived

2130
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,120
but about, in those days

2131
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,040
how many moments we were truly alive

2132
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,720
Ren Weishan

2133
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,280
He acts under the guise of kindness

2134
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,720
and runs these companies.

2135
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,640
But in reality,

2136
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,880
behind the scenes, he controls a very

2137
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,960
large and illegal

2138
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,040
and extremely vicious interest group.

2139
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,080
It's extremely cruel.

2140
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,320
He turns many young, innocent women

2141
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,720
into childbearing machines.

2142
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,640
They are checked for no previous medical history,

2143
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,240
no bad habits,
and excellent genes.

2144
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
They are able to give birth.

2145
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,880
They have already given birth for Ren Weishan,

2146
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,480
having two sons and one daughter.

2147
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,320
They even specially created

2148
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,240
a system

2149
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,240
to evaluate the quality of their genes.

2150
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,040
This is extremely sick,
perverse,

2151
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,840
and utterly vile.

2152
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,920
I hope all women

2153
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,960
when faced with any

2154
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,240
situation that makes them uncomfortable,

2155
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,160
can bravely say no.

2156
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,880
May all women
truly have

2157
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,360
control over their own bodies.

2158
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,280
May every child

2159
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,840
grow up safely and happily in the sunlight.

2160
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,080
We all played the role of scapegoat friends.

2161
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,200
When they have problems themselves,

2162
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,480
they vent to you,

2163
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,280
dumping all their negative emotions onto you.

2164
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,760
I happened to think he was me,

2165
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,480
so I beat him up.

2166
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,040
My friend Bai and I were in the same scene.

2167
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,400
He also had this script.

2168
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,200
You falsely accused him.

2169
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,240
Being friends with someone like this

2170
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:01,880
really

2171
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,240
If you ever meet a friend like this,

2172
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,440
I hope you learn to cut your losses in time.

2173
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,280
Have the courage to walk away.

2174
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,440
Feudal superstitions

2175
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,400
definitely lack a lot

2176
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,240
of scientific basis.

2177
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,520
They lead to blind worship.

2178
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,720
In fact, it allows many people

2179
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,200
to take advantage of you for their own gain.

2180
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,440
Don't be the one to lead in superstition.

2181
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,040
Believe in the power of science.

2182
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,240
Let reason light the path ahead for us.

2183
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,680
Every little thing humans do

2184
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,040
affects their future.

2185
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,640
Once lived in cold and damp

2186
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,920
caves.

2187
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,080
Everyone fell asleep in the cold.

2188
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,880
It was all caused by the ignorance of people here.

2189
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,720
As for the future world,

2190
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,920
it is actually created by people today.

2191
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,400
That's right.

2192
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,440
These earth resources slipping through our fingers

2193
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,560
are not just simple numbers.

2194
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,280
They are bills our descendants will have to pay.

2195
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,240
I hope everyone will take action.

2196
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,320
Cherish every resource.

2197
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,320
Because every step we take

2198
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,000
truly affects the future of the Earth.

2199
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,000
He Li Mo Jin Yu

2200
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,080
See you in the market in 2025.

2201
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,120
Goodbye.

2202
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,240
Goodbye, friends.

2203
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,840
Goodbye, friends. Goodbye. Say (goodbye).

2204
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,640
We interrupt with breaking news.

2205
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,960
Following the incident at Apartment 11,

2206
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,600
Tui Town,

2207
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,160
Tui Sweets Factory,

2208
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,320
Classic Eternal Pirate Mansion,

2209
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,760
Tui Billion Film Company,

2210
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,240
and Tui Soil Village, where strange cases have occurred,

2211
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,480
Tui City is once again facing an unknown crisis.

2212
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,640
Location: Tui City.

2213
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,360
The finale dinner of "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3.

2214
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,160
I'm going to finish this bowl.
Changsha's food is still the best.

2215
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,320
What's wrong?
He ate a yogurt curd.

2216
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,200
Summer Four-Fruit Soup.

2217
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,320
They even specially made a goldfish.

2218
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,480
That's He Li touching Jin Yu.

2219
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,400
We should do a food travel variety show.

2220
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,880
Rice wine Hakka Hetian chicken.

2221
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,520
It has a wine aroma.

2222
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,160
Its logic should be...

2223
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:57,600
No.

2224
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,800
It's all logic again, amazing.

2225
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,160
The trophy just doesn't have any words on it.

2226
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,560
I'm called "Crying and Laughing."

2227
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,720
I'm both crying and laughing.

2228
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,200
But I can't get the golden key.

2229
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,320
You can't help but laugh.

2230
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,920
You can't help but be bad.

2231
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,040
He can't help but love.

2232
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,240
May I ask Zhou Keyu,

2233
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,400
if you return to the real world,

2234
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,720
what do the older brothers and sisters mean to you

2235
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,000
in terms of their roles?

2236
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,040
Can't help but love.

2237
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,440
I hope everyone doesn't do this.

2238
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,560
Remember these iconic moments.

2239
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,080
It will make them excited.

2240
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,440
In the third season of "Start Reasoning",

2241
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,560
what memorable scenes do you all remember?

2242
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,880
It's public embarrassment again.

2243
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,520
I was riding on Keyu's back.

2244
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,600
It was also that swimming pool.

2245
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,840
I'm the same as Brother Ning.

2246
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,720
You can tell at a glance

2247
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,640
he's a science and engineering guy who's great at math, physics, and chemistry.

2248
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,840
What are the five of us?

2249
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,560
Jellyfish?
I didn't draw people.

2250
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,320
You didn't draw people, so you don't have anyone in your heart.

2251
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,400
We're not in your heart.

2252
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,040
What impressed you was the pool, not us.

2253
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,320
Let me tell you, he didn't say a word.

2254
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,720
Anyone could be in there.

2255
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,920
He's 12 years younger than you.

2256
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,640
Sorry, little brother.

2257
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,920
I think this drawing is really good.

2258
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,080
Next up is

2259
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,840
the awarding of the "Star of Reasoning City".

2260
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,440
Thank you for letting me win.
I think it's me.

2261
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,880
Congratulations.

2262
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,720
Split my consciousness into two

2263
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,000
After controlling these two people

2264
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,040
I can blend in among them

2265
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,480
After seeing the eye gesture

2266
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,520
I immediately realized

2267
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,080
The six detectives were reincarnated into

2268
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,720
the bodies of my family members

2269
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,520
I can't get rid of the detectives by killing the bodies

2270
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,440
to eliminate the detectives

2271
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,880
Otherwise, my family would die too

2272
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,600
So I can only blend in with them for now

2273
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,640
and closely monitor their movements

2274
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,840
Jingou Baiou

2275
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:26,760
That's mine

2276
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,400
You said it was delicious yesterday

2277
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,600
This one is super tasty

2278
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,920
There's still one unopened here

2279
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,080
Noodles, do you want some?

2280
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:33,840
I'll mix it for you
What do you want to eat?

2281
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,600
I can skip eating

2282
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,600
Oh no, my voice is even hoarser

2283
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,840
It wasn't hoarse at all during the debate just now

2284
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,400
I was just about to ask how you suddenly got better

2285
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,880
Those two

2286
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,280
The down-and-out returnee from abroad

2287
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,480
The aloof young lady

2288
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,040
I don't believe you all can pass this round

2289
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,600
Show us the replay

2290
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,400
Jiawei just now was
lifted off the ground, right?

2291
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,000
He was airborne
His belly button was showing

2292
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,800
Don't catch a cold, keep your stomach warm

2293
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:05,800
Slim waist
