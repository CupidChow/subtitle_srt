1
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,280
Young Master

2
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,720
Young Master

3
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,880
Young Master

4
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Young Master

5
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
Daughter-in-law, wake up. Daughter-in-law.

6
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Young Master

7
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
Young Master

8
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,120
Daughter-in-law, wake up.

9
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,160
Push harder.

10
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,000
Young Master

11
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,720
Big Brother

12
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, wake up.

13
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
Young Master

14
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
Awake.

15
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,520
Young Master

16
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Young Master

17
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,360
Young Master is awake.

18
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,279
Brother

19
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,399
You're awake, son.

20
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,760
Awake.

21
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,880
Where is this?

22
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Who are you?

23
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
Who are we?

24
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,880
This

25
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,920
All forgotten

26
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
So familiar

27
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Okay

28
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
Such a beautiful face

29
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
What

30
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
You are... who are you?

31
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
Yeah, who are you?

32
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm your stepmother

33
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,520
Stepmother?

34
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,240
No

35
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,880
Don't panic

36
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,840
Don't panic

37
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,480
Here's the situation

38
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Your name is Gudefuhe

39
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Your name is Jingou Baio

40
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,920
That's right

41
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,440
Jingou Baio

42
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
Jingou Baio

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm your father

44
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
My name is Gudemoning

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Do you remember now?

46
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
I don't want to remember

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Even if you don't want to remember, you have to accept the truth

48
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,240
Big brother, I'm your younger brother

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,480
You're my younger brother?

50
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
Call

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,240
Gude

52
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,920
No

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,080
Baide

54
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,960
Baide Boyi

55
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,640
Boyi

56
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,360
Boyi

57
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
Baide Boyi

58
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes, after you and your sister-in-law fainted,

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,160
I was really worried.

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,760
Wait.

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,520
What sister-in-law?

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,840
No, you must be mistaken.

63
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Do you think this is appropriate?

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,080
A talented man and a beautiful woman, right?

65
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,560
Wait.

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
Like this.

67
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,360
Let me faint again and do it over.

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,800
What sister-in-law?

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
Why faint again and do it over?

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
Get up.

71
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,440
No do-overs.

72
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
I’m not finished yet.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Let me do it, don’t move.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,320
Let me use

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,760
my true love’s kiss.

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,520
I want to give you a true love’s kiss.

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,280
Wait a second.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Hold on.

79
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Wake up.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,640
Alright, I forgot to introduce someone.

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
This is your stepmother.

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,480
I admit, she’s my stepmother.

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,280
Stepmother.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,560
Above the moon.

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Call her mom.

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
This is our butler.

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Goodlaco.

88
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,160
That’s right.

89
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,600
Yesterday at noon,

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
the two of you suddenly fainted.

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,560
And then,

92
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
we were unconscious for a whole day.

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
That's right, we were out for an entire day.

94
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,360
But fortunately,

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,640
it's great that you both woke up.

96
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Because today happens to be

97
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,680
May 8th, 1925.

98
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,920
It's my 60th birthday.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,200
Today is your big birthday celebration.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
That's right, and you both woke up just in time.

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,560
That's wonderful.

102
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
Dad, I want to ask something.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
It seems there's someone over there

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
who is even more senior and respected than us.

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Great-grandfather.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,960
Great-grandfather.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Grandson.

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Granddaughter-in-law.

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,560
Do you still recognize your grandfather?

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
I can't really remember.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,560
I am the great-grandfather of the Gu De family.

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,040
Great-grandfather Gu De.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Just call me Great-grandfather Gu De.

114
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,640
Such a straightforward name.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
How did things end up like this?

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,880
You don't even remember your grandfather.

117
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
It's all right.

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
It doesn't matter if you remember or not.

120
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,760
Let's keep playing music and dancing.

121
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Maybe as we dance, the memories will come back.

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,320
Next, let's have everyone take their seats.

123
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Young master.

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Young mistress.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,840
Master and madam.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,760
Come.

127
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,840
Grandson, sit with your grandfather.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Please, have a seat.

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,040
Today is a day of great celebration.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,800
That's right.

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,280
Son,

132
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
I've prepared a gift for you.

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,440
This is about our

134
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,400
Good family—a painting of our family.

135
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
What's depicted on it

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,000
is the ancestral home of the Good family.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,040
It's the very place we're in right now.

138
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Good Mansion.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,840
I want to ask,

140
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,160
today is my birthday celebration,

141
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,520
but you painted two cranes flying west.

142
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,240
Is this...

143
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
Is there a meaning behind this?

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
"Riding a crane to the west"...

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,280
That's the meaning, right?

146
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
A meaning...

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,800
Alright.

148
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,640
This painting has been passed down from our ancestors.

149
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't mind those details.

150
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Alright.

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,320
Okay.

152
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaking of this painting,

153
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,200
in our Tuitu Village,

154
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
there has always been a legend.

155
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,320
Does anyone still remember it?

156
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,080
I do.

157
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,000
Xiao Sun, go ahead and tell everyone.

158
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,800
It's said that

159
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,840
in our area,

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
as long as you add human blood while painting,

161
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,440
if you introduce human blood,

162
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,000
the owner of the blood can be drawn into the painting.

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,320
Those inside the painting never age or die.

164
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,840
Then why don't you go in?

165
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
Wait for the right moment

166
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,920
Then this person can come out again

167
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
I will come back

168
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,680
As expected of my grandson, so clever

169
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
You should show off a bit too

170
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
He’s stolen all the spotlight

171
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,080
You are the eldest legitimate grandson

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,560
Today is father’s birthday

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
Stop arguing.

174
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,760
All this family fortune in the future

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,920
will be left to you.

176
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
Who is it? Who exactly?

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
Which one? I really want to know.

178
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm not dead yet.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Great-grandpa isn't dead yet.

180
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,640
And you're already dividing up the inheritance.

181
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,520
Sister-in-law.

182
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
I always suspected you came to our family

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
for our family's money.

184
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,280
What else could it be?

185
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,880
Just look at her face,

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,400
she's clearly greedy for

187
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,680
the wealth of our Gu De family.

188
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,320
That's right.

189
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Do you all know

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
that our Gu De family

191
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,840
is the most renowned family for calligraphy and painting in the whole village?

192
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,960
In our family,

193
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,560
there is a ritual passed down through generations called the "Calling Relatives Ceremony."

194
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,840
The Calling Relatives Ceremony.

195
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,760
What does the Calling Relatives Ceremony mean?

196
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
It's a ceremony to call upon relatives,

197
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
and it's related to paintings.

198
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,960
This ceremony can only be held once a year.

199
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
By performing this ceremony,

200
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,240
you can open the world inside the painting

201
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
and a passage to the real world.

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,600
It allows us to communicate with the people

203
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
inside the painting.

204
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,080
Since today is such a joyous occasion,

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,600
I've decided

206
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
to hold the Calling Relatives Ceremony.

207
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,200
So that our

208
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,840
little treasure in the family

209
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
can also take part.

210
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
Little treasure.

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
Little treasure.

212
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Gu De's little treasure.

213
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,480
He is the youngest member of our family.

214
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,840
Who gave birth to him?

215
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
He is also the child of you two.

216
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
We already have a child.

217
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
Didn't your child die?

218
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,320
What?

219
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
No.

220
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,400
He is alive.

221
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
He will always live in my heart.

222
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,400
He is not dead.

223
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,040
Don't worry.

224
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
The ritual has begun.

225
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
He is in the world inside the painting.

226
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,960
Today is all about

227
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,560
bringing him out from the world inside the painting.

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,920
so he can join us and have some fun.

229
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,560
Okay.

230
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Alright.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,200
Then let me tell you

232
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,800
the specific steps of this ritual.

233
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,720
Come.

234
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Gudefuhe.

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
Golden Hook Breaks the Lotus Root.

236
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,080
Sit in the center of this room.

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,440
Wait, I want to ask something.

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,920
How did this child get in there?

239
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,240
Gudefuhe.

240
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
I know you've always been dissatisfied with me.

241
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,960
But why

242
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,040
did you put our precious child in there?

243
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Is it because you want to have another one?

244
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
Sit down.

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
Okay.

246
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
You two need to listen carefully.

247
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,840
After the ceremony starts,

248
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,200
you need to close your eyes.

249
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,760
then sing a song for the baby.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Please, I don't want the baby anymore.

251
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,880
I really can't do this, Grandpa.

252
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm really scared of this.

253
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
Don't be afraid, what are you scared of?

254
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
It's your own child.

255
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,240
The easiest way is to let him hold you.

256
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
Then you won't be scared, okay?

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,840
Come here, daughter-in-law.

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
It's okay, come on.

259
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,840
That song.

260
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,400
It's the one I often sing to you.

261
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
What song should I sing?

262
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
You decide, okay?

263
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
This is for your baby to hear.

264
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,160
Everyone else, follow my instructions.

265
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay.

266
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,040
Alright.

267
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,800
Son, look at me.

268
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,080
Son, look at me.

269
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Good boy.

270
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,920
Son.

271
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
Your father is calling you.

272
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,920
You...

273
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Dad.

274
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,360
Sorry.

275
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,280
Why are you staring straight at your granddaughter-in-law?

276
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
What's going on?

277
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,920
He’s obsessed with our couple.

278
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,720
Dad, sorry.

279
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,160
Son.

280
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Go stand in the southeast corner of the room.

281
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,360
Southeast.

282
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
Don’t do this.

283
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,360
Seriously, don’t. I’m really scared.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,600
At least the two of us are together.

285
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,880
Daughter-in-law.

286
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
You go stand in the northwest corner.

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
No way, is this really a ritual?

288
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,520
It’s really scary.

289
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,640
You turned up the intensity as soon as you arrived.

290
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,000
Let me tell you.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Even the walls might collapse.

292
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,440
It’s over.

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,480
Don’t treat me like this.

294
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,120
Butler Ke is in the southwest corner.

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,840
See, my little grandson is still the smartest.

296
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,240
He found the right spot by himself.

297
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,480
Great-grandpa will stand with you.

298
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,880
This is how the ceremony will go in a moment.

299
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,840
I'll walk straight ahead first.

300
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,400
Then, when I tap the next person's shoulder,

301
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,280
that person will walk straight ahead to the next one.

302
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,080
Until...

303
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,680
No way.

304
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,160
...tapping the next person's shoulder.

305
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
Remember,

306
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,640
no talking during the entire ceremony.

307
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,480
No making any sounds.

308
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,800
Okay.

309
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,080
What song should we sing together?

310
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,880
How about "Little Swallow"?

311
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,800
"Little Swallow" works too.

312
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
Little Swallow.

313
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,400
That's fine.

314
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
I'm feeling it now.

315
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,320
It's got the right vibe.

316
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,200
Wearing a floral dress.

317
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,720
I don't want to sing.

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,320
This song is really good.

319
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,080
Is everyone ready?

320
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,960
Ready.

321
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,800
Then let Grandpa play the music.

322
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,120
Turn off the lights.

323
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,680
The little one will be here soon.

324
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
You'll know when it happens.

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,680
Alright.

326
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,320
Come on.

327
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
Focus.

328
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,040
Grandpa is about to play the music.

329
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
Don't scare me.

330
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,360
This is the music.

331
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,640
Little swallow, wearing a flowery dress

332
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm really scared

333
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,720
Every spring, you come here

334
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,560
I ask the swallow, why do you come

335
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
Every spring

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,240
You come here

337
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,480
I ask the swallow, why do you come

338
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
Here

339
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,800
It's so cold

340
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,920
Spring is the most beautiful

341
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
You're way off key

342
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,760
Wearing a flowery dress

343
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,680
Sing a bit lower

344
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,520
Every spring, you come here

345
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,760
Wearing a flowery dress

346
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,640
Every spring, you come here

347
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
Still need to keep going

348
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,960
Every spring, you come here

349
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
That's not right

350
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
Wearing a flowery dress

351
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,400
Someone's moving, that's not right

352
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Child

353
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,920
Here

354
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,400
My child

355
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
Come back quickly

356
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,360
Mom is waiting for you

357
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,360
Come back quickly

358
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,640
(Mom) is waiting for you

359
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,360
Great-grandpa is missing

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
Who's missing

361
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,360
Great-grandpa is missing

362
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,080
What should we do

363
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,680
Then can we open our eyes

364
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
No

365
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Look for the lamp, light it up

366
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
The lamp, where is it

367
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,440
Daughter-in-law

368
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,280
Daughter-in-law, hurry up

369
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
I found a candle

370
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
No.

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
That scared me to death.

372
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,280
Great-grandpa should be waiting for me here.

373
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,600
When I got here, great-grandpa was already gone.

374
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
Because when you film someone, don't you keep moving forward?

375
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm always behind great-grandpa.

376
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
How many times have we gone around already?

377
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,920
Blood.

378
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
Great-grandpa went in.

379
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,160
This...

380
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,400
As long as you use human blood while painting,

381
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,640
you can draw the owner of the blood into the painting.

382
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,960
Great-grandpa went in.

383
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,800
Great-grandpa's blood spilled out.

384
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Didn't we just mention a legend?

385
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
The legend says if you paint with blood,

386
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
soaking it in blood lets people go in, right?

387
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,560
Right.

388
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,000
You have to put that person's blood on the painting to go in.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Only then will that person go in.

390
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,120
Right.

391
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,600
That's correct.

392
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
So great-grandpa went in by himself.

393
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,040
Open the door.

394
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,520
Please come in.

395
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
Could it be that our treasure is back?

396
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,040
Our treasure is back!

397
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
Great-grandpa, old...

398
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,360
Great-grandpa went on a business trip.

399
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,400
A business trip?

400
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,280
Impossible.

401
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,920
Where's great-grandpa?

402
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,280
Did you hide great-grandpa somewhere?

403
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,520
Yes, he's hiding here.

404
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
He said not to look for him.

405
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,360
Great-grandpa.

406
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,800
He's playing.

407
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,040
That old guy is playing, isn't he?

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
Just now, there were only six of you in this room.

409
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,360
The old master must have been hidden by you.

410
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
He went on a business trip.

411
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,280
It's fine.

412
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
Friends, here's the situation.

413
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Not friends, son.

414
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,400
The butler, the daughter-in-law.

415
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
Madam, here's the situation.

416
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,720
It's not a big deal that the old master is missing.

417
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,480
The old master is missing.

418
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
Naturally, I become the head of the family.

419
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,160
You killed him.

420
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,520
It doesn't matter.

421
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,800
You can temporarily say I killed him.

422
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,920
But I want to say, it doesn't matter.

423
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,320
This—

424
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
We can boldly admit it.

425
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
The old master really is missing.

426
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,600
Did the old master just vanish into thin air?

427
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes, he went into the painting.

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
The old master is here now.

429
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Nonsense.

430
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
He's a perfectly healthy, living person.

431
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,600
How could he just disappear into thin air?

432
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
If I tell you the truth, you don't believe me.

433
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,440
If I lie to you, you don't believe me either.

434
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,120
If the old master really vanished into thin air,

435
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,320
you must help the old master.

436
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,960
Find out the truth of what happened.

437
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Alright.

438
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay.

439
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,280
Then where did she come from?

440
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,200
She doesn't even know about the rumor in our village.

441
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,680
Who are you?

442
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm from the Liyue troupe.

443
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
The old master invited me here.

444
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,240
My name is Li Yuebang.

445
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
Li Yuebang.

446
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,760
Li Yuebang.

447
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Li Yuebang.

448
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
When the old master disappeared,

449
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
where were all of you?

450
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,040
We were all in this room.

451
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,640
We were all in this room.

452
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
But they were separated.

453
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:00,880
That's right.

454
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Only my husband and I

455
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,680
were holding hands tightly.

456
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,000
That's correct.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,880
Our faces were pressed closely together.

458
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,840
Alright, I trust you.

459
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
Here.

460
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,280
Thank you.

461
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,000
Puzzle-solving and reasoning tests, all available online with Tongcheng.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
This is Tongcheng Travel.

463
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
We've prepared an evidence-gathering tool for everyone.

464
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,000
We hope it helps you organize your clues.

465
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,960
And clarify the logical connections.

466
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,000
It's time to uncover the truth.

467
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
Let's set out together with Tongcheng.

468
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay.

469
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,280
What's wrong?

470
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,960
In this village,

471
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
even the elderly and children know

472
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
that this house

473
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,440
is not clean.

474
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
You're saying in front of my family

475
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,120
that our house is not clean?

476
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,200
Isn't that a bit...

477
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,920
Enough!

478
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,800
It seems you can see the deceased.

479
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,040
Anyway,

480
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,840
when you investigate,

481
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,200
be sure to be careful.

482
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,520
I'll be going now.

483
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,360
Be sure to be careful.

484
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
What do you mean by "the deceased"?

485
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,000
This...

486
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,680
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

487
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
Case Seven officially begins

488
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,000
It is now May 8th, 12:30 PM

489
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
The victim in this case is Grandpa Good

490
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,720
After a preliminary investigation

491
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,000
the suspects have been narrowed down to

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Good Laco

493
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,160
Good Morning

494
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,160
Above the Moon

495
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,040
White Debate

496
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Among these four

497
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,880
Golden Hook and Good Fuhe

498
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,680
can be ruled out as suspects

499
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,760
Therefore, you are the detectives for this case

500
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
Now, detectives, please lead the suspects

501
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
and begin collecting evidence

502
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,520
No need to explain the relationships

503
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
They're all our elders

504
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,040
We're all one big family

505
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,840
And there's no body

506
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
So does that mean he is already

507
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,880
confirmed dead?

508
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,400
He isn't dead

509
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,880
He just went in

510
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
But through a ritual

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
we can still summon him

512
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,240
Right

513
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,160
So someone made him go in

514
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,440
on purpose

515
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
It was a trick

516
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,240
Trying to

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,720
take Grandpa's fortune for themselves

518
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
So after Grandpa dies

519
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,240
who gets the inheritance?

520
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,960
Right

521
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,920
Of course, it's me

522
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,880
Who benefits from his death

523
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
Who is the beneficiary

524
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,400
Insolent.

525
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
Don't forget your place, son.

526
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
You dare to accuse your father at a time like this?

527
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,520
I'm the investigator.

528
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
You're the most suspicious.

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm the most suspicious?

530
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
Defying your superior, daring to go against me.

531
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,760
You even challenge the investigator—utterly rebellious.

532
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,080
Even if you were the emperor himself,

533
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,920
you're still my son.

534
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm also a detective.

535
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
Don't forget.

536
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,000
One of us is still X.

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm your husband.

538
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,320
Your husband.

539
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
Okay.

540
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,640
That's it for today.

541
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,520
Speechless.

542
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,200
Really.

543
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,680
Speechless.

544
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,600
Can't play anymore.

545
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
Alright, so should we...

546
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,000
Son.

547
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,960
Let's lead everyone first.

548
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,240
Let's search the scene.

549
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,840
Yeah.

550
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,240
Come on.

551
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's start at the crime scene.

552
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
See if there's any suspicious evidence.

553
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,680
Okay.

554
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
The culprit must have left something here.

555
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,600
Left something unforgettable.

556
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,280
Actually, there's an apple core left behind.

557
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,960
Who left it?

558
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,280
Me.

559
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,160
I think this pastry is suspicious.

560
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,120
Let me try it.

561
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,560
It's pretty good. I ate one.

562
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,440
Wait, there's a water stain here.

563
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,840
A water stain?

564
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,560
Someone must have peed themselves from fear just now.

565
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,280
Who was it?

566
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,040
Is this the Four Treasures of the Study?

567
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,480
The Four Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

568
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,120
Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

569
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,400
Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

570
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
Behind this painting...

571
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,560
No, there's nothing.

572
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,840
I just checked, there's nothing there either.

573
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,160
The problem is, there's blood on this.

574
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Anyway, it's confirmed to be Great-grandpa's blood.

575
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
According to the legend,

576
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,840
Right?

577
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,280
Right.

578
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,320
So that means Great-grandpa had to come here first.

579
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,200
He splashed the great-grandfather's blood up there.

580
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,840
Then the great-grandfather went in.

581
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,760
The culprit must be here.

582
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Auto-generated.

583
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Right, the culprit will be here.

584
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Yes.

585
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,760
Come on, let's search, let's search.

586
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,120
Is there nothing at all?

587
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,640
How do we search this place?

588
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
There's nothing.

589
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
It's hard to say, this is really hard to say.

590
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,920
Because if the great-grandfather was moved after bleeding,

591
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,600
and was taken away,

592
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,440
there would definitely be bloodstains left behind.

593
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Yes.

594
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,160
So the uniqueness of this case

595
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,800
is that there's no body.

596
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,320
Yes.

597
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Yes.

598
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,280
So we've lost a lot of

599
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,320
ways to discover the crime process through the body

600
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,040
and the methods used.

601
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,760
Yes.

602
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,640
Did the old master eat something and die from poisoning?

603
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,000
No, it wasn't poisoning.

604
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,760
There can't be no body.

605
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,080
There is.

606
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,760
There is.

607
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,560
What is this?

608
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,920
Both four-digit passwords are letters.

609
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,120
Letters.

610
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,680
Got it.

611
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
Two people's names.

612
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
Good-something-something.

613
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,760
Good-something-something.

614
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,440
The two of us.

615
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
Jingou Baio and Goodfuhe.

616
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,360
Okay.

617
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,400
Jingou Baio.

618
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,920
No "Jin".

619
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
No "G D" either.

620
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,320
No ABCD or UVW.

621
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,160
Maybe they're not names.

622
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Let's try again later.

623
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,280
We'll figure something out later.

624
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,680
I think we can only search outside now.

625
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
So since this place

626
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,800
doesn't have any other concrete clues,

627
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
we can go

628
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
check out the old master's room.

629
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,480
Okay, let's go.

630
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,080
Alright.

631
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,600
Let's go.

632
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
Let's leave this box here for now.

633
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,080
Leave it here for now.

634
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay, sure.

635
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,720
Why did the lights go out again?

636
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
Come over in a moment.

637
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Here.

638
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm here.

639
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,800
Come on, hold onto something.

640
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,440
How do we get out of here?

641
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
What do we do? How do we handle this?

642
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,520
Who is this?

643
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:39,840
It's me.

644
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
We should turn right.

645
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
I just checked.

646
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
It's over here.

647
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,360
Son.

648
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,480
Stop fooling around.

649
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,400
Keep going forward, go ahead.

650
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,360
Are you scared?

651
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm okay for now.

652
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,320
But that place...

653
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,880
Child

654
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Our daughter

655
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
Wait, what?

656
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,520
Is it the baby?

657
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
I don't dare look

658
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,480
This is your child

659
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,080
I can't look

660
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,160
It's your precious baby, take a look

661
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,800
I won't look

662
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,720
Precious baby

663
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't want to look

664
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
It's pretty cute

665
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:16,880
Really?

666
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,440
So cute

667
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,480
Why is it gone?

668
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,240
You can see the dead

669
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,680
Yeah, just now

670
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,080
Yes

671
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,000
That legend from before is true

672
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
This house isn't clean

673
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,320
It seems you can see the deceased

674
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
Let's go, to the old master's room

675
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,960
Go, move forward

676
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,120
Let's go

677
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,120
Why is he so eager?

678
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,800
Because he's familiar with the crime scene

679
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,280
Where were we going first?

680
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,080
The old master's room

681
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Go to the old master's room

682
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,800
The old master's room should be this way

683
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,120
This

684
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,520
Use more force

685
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,480
It's also very simple.

686
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,800
The old master's room is so small.

687
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,520
It's very plain.

688
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,280
As his son,

689
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,760
how do you take care of the old master?

690
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,640
Our family, the Gu De family,

691
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,440
although on the surface

692
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,000
looks glamorous,

693
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,960
very glamorous,

694
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,360
in reality, we are all very frugal.

695
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
Alright, a clue has appeared.

696
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,160
So soon?

697
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Okay, so here's the situation now.

698
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,480
It says the birthday banquet starts at noon on May 8th.

699
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,920
A birthday painting is used as a gift.

700
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,720
Then the birthday painting is hung on the wall.

701
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,360
Under the decoration of the brush-washing basin.

702
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,680
Next, the family-calling ceremony is recreated exactly as before.

703
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
Gu Defuhe and Jin Gou break lotus roots.

704
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
They sit on the couch in the center.

705
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,320
The others are seated according to their assigned numbers.

706
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Spread out in the four corners of the main hall.

707
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,760
So the culprit has been here.

708
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,280
They've seen this.

709
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,320
He knows where he was standing.

710
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,320
No.

711
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,080
Do you know

712
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
what the most important clue in this is?

713
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,320
Hanging the painting under the brush-washing basin decoration on the wall.

714
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,840
Just now, we...

715
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,720
What is a brush-washing basin?

716
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,080
It's...

717
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,400
Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

718
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,080
No.

719
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
For example, let's say this is a painting.

720
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,440
I prepared red dye underneath in advance.

721
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,480
After soaking it in water,

722
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,520
the red dye would come out, right?

723
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,760
So it's very possible that

724
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
it's not Great-grandfather's blood.

725
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
He could have used another method

726
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,240
to kill Great-grandfather first,

727
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,520
then use this brush-washing device

728
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,080
to fake the blood.

729
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,600
The painting.

730
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,080
What comes out.

731
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,120
Yes, that's right.

732
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,080
It's over.

733
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
I found something really shocking.

734
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,480
What is it, dear?

735
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,320
The gossip tabloid.

736
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
A terrifying secret has surfaced in the Gude family.

737
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
The Gude family's young daughter, Gude Baobei,

738
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,200
has been frail and sickly since childhood.

739
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,960
Recently, her condition became critical.

740
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,640
Gude Fuhe and his wife Jingou Baio

741
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,960
are deeply worried.

742
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
They've sought medical help everywhere to no avail.

743
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,120
A mysterious village legend

744
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,480
became their last hope.

745
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,640
Using human blood in a painting

746
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,240
can seal a soul within the scroll.

747
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,640
The person in the painting will not age or die.

748
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,640
When the time is right, the scroll can be broken and the person reborn.

749
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,840
The Gude couple followed the method from the legend

750
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,400
and painted a family portrait of the three of them.

751
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,560
So, earlier, the two of us

752
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,520
did it because Baobei was dying.

753
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
We didn't want her to die.

754
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,160
We wanted to seal her inside the painting.

755
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,400
So we painted a picture of the three of us.

756
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,720
And Baobei went inside.

757
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,120
Wait.

758
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,360
There's an even scarier newspaper.

759
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,520
Two months ago,

760
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,880
the Good family suffered a series of tragedies.

761
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,840
After the death of the Good family's baby,

762
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,760
the eldest young master and his wife also

763
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,800
died suddenly.

764
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,600
You two have already...

765
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,880
What?

766
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
Then what are you two now?

767
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,400
And also,

768
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,520
after they passed away,

769
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,680
their father, Good Morning,

770
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
and the young master, White Debo, on the moon,

771
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,040
along with the butler, Good Laco,

772
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,080
all passed away one after another.

773
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,920
They're all dead.

774
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,960
Then the Good mansion

775
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,880
stood empty for over a month.

776
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,880
At the start of spring, strange things began to happen.

777
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,440
Someone saw the mansion brightly lit from afar.

778
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,560
There were many eerie shadows.

779
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,240
Is it a sign of the painted wall,

780
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
or restless spirits lingering?

781
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,760
Actually, we are not...

782
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,080
We are already dead.

783
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
We've actually been trapped inside the painting.

784
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,520
The versions of us appearing now

785
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,920
might be after the summoning ritual,

786
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,760
the reborn versions of us.

787
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,360
That's why this is in his room.

788
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,360
But every person is empty.

789
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,000
That means we've come out of the painting.

790
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,520
Right?

791
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,040
Right.

792
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,720
That also means we

793
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,520
used to live here.

794
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,720
And maybe

795
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
we don't know that we're already dead.

796
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
We were just sent in by someone.

797
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Yes, that's possible.

798
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,600
The current clue is

799
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,040
we've already come out of the painting.

800
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,560
Right.

801
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,960
Yes, and others think we're ghosts.

802
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,240
Yes.

803
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,360
This is also a news story from Tuitu Village.

804
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
Painting Entry Record

805
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Li Si's

806
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,520
great-grandmother

807
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,640
two weeks ago

808
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,880
mysteriously disappeared

809
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,280
great-grandmother suddenly appeared in the painting

810
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,960
then blood seeped from the canvas

811
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,320
Painting Entry Record Two

812
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,480
Zhang San's older sister mysteriously disappeared last week

813
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,000
the sister suddenly appeared in the painting

814
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
Painting Entry Record Three

815
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,000
Wang Wu's father mysteriously disappeared a few days ago

816
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
the father suddenly appeared in the painting

817
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
It's a serial killing

818
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,280
For every person killed, one is painted

819
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,520
Right?

820
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,679
What do you think, big brother?

821
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Impressive.

822
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,239
What is it?

823
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,520
The servant reported.

824
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,920
He talked about the gossip history of our family.

825
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,719
Come here, come here.

826
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
Does it have anything to do with me?

827
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,120
Stand in front of me.

828
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,080
What's wrong?

829
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,880
No.

830
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Do you believe what these marketing accounts write?

831
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,280
Hurry up.

832
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
No, can you really trust what those marketing accounts say?

833
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,400
So you already know, right?

834
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,320
Then say it yourself.

835
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,120
Sometimes when I check trending topics, I see some

836
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,280
false rumors about myself.

837
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,040
Be honest.

838
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,800
It’s all “uncle and sister-in-law” fiction.

839
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,400
My younger brother and my wife.

840
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,280
Go ahead and talk.

841
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,920
You two as a pair...

842
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
Aren't you two going to sit together?

843
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,120
You explain it yourself.

844
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,080
I don't know.

845
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,160
I've lost my memory.

846
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,400
I've lost my memory too.

847
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,520
Alright.

848
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,360
I really have amnesia.

849
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,600
Ask Dad if I really have amnesia.

850
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,440
Dad.

851
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,240
You also have a stepdad.

852
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm the main dad, she's the stepmom.

853
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,120
It's all the same, that's what I mean.

854
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,720
What's going on with you two?

855
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,400
Be honest and you'll get leniency.

856
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
I really have amnesia.

857
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,800
I don't know, I have amnesia too.

858
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,680
Whenever something happens, you claim amnesia again.

859
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
I really have amnesia.

860
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,160
So does seeing this picture remind you of anything?

861
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,200
I just think sister-in-law is very beautiful.

862
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,280
So I wanted to look at her a bit more.

863
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,320
That's your sister-in-law, you know.

864
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,080
He means he sneaks a look each time.

865
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,960
And marks a tally for each look.

866
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,600
Right.

867
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
But he's already marked...

868
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

869
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
He's already looked over seven hundred times.

870
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,480
Besides sneaking looks?

871
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,520
Besides sneaking looks?

872
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,080
All I can do is sneak a look, what else could I do?

873
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
What else could I do?

874
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,360
If I get a little closer, I would...

875
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,040
It's fine, I think I can relax about it.

876
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
Because look, here's the next book.

877
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,440
The next book.

878
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,480
This...

879
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,280
You tell us.

880
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
Impossible.

881
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
Come.

882
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,520
Sit here.

883
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,120
The four of us won't be crowded.

884
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,280
This is...

885
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,080
No, this...

886
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,760
You peeked at someone taking a bath.

887
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
That's too much.

888
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,280
You shouldn't have.

889
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,840
You're the one who was being inappropriate.

890
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,440
I wanted to do it for you to see.

891
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,160
But she ended up seeing it.

892
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,040
Besides, he's my son.

893
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,240
I'm just concerned about my son's health.

894
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,040
Fake son.

895
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,680
What's wrong?

896
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,840
A fake son isn't a real son.

897
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,320
Not a real son.

898
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,160
Stop telling the master these things.

899
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,480
Right, but the problem is...

900
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,520
You don't need to make excuses for yourself.

901
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,400
You woman...

902
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,440
Dad, does your heart hurt?

903
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,240
But Dad, wait a moment.

904
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,320
There's one more.

905
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,440
I think he can sit over here too.

906
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Let me see.

907
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,800
No.

908
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,720
What?

909
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,640
Wait a second.

910
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,040
I really don't remember anything.

911
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,280
Dad's medicine—his blood pressure medicine!

912
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Hurry!

913
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
Press his philtrum for me, I need to recite.

914
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,720
Quick-acting heart pills!

915
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Wait, what?

916
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,640
Bai's biological father is actually...

917
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
Lake.

918
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,640
What?

919
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,800
You have a new dad now.

920
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,600
No.

921
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,080
If you're my biological father,

922
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
then who is my biological mother?

923
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,000
Your biological mother is still her.

924
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,320
But I want to ask something.

925
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
Why did you lift his blanket?

926
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,560
What exactly were you looking for?

927
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,000
A birthmark.

928
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,880
The way he drew it is a bit strange.

929
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,440
It's easy to misunderstand.

930
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't have a birthmark on my leg.

931
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,560
I only have a birthmark here.

932
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680
If I say you have one, then you have one.

933
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,640
What a domineering father.

934
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,320
Hurry, father and son, recognize each other.

935
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,720
Leaving you alone.

936
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,040
You're the only outsider in this family.

937
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,840
Looks like I'm an outsider.

938
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,560
I don't know him.

939
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,240
I don't know him.

940
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,240
Right now, he...

941
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,360
Of course you...

942
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,440
He can't accept it right away.

943
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,600
He's just a butler.

944
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,000
You need to give him some time to accept it.

945
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,840
He's just a lowly butler.

946
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
I understand him very well.

947
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,760
Son.

948
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,520
Cut ties with him.

949
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,160
If you need money in the future, I'll give it to you.

950
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,880
But...

951
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,080
Let's just give it to him directly.

952
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,960
Wouldn't that be better?

953
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
See, I knew he would react like this.

954
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,760
So all these years,

955
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,320
I never told him.

956
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
A father's love is as strong as a mountain.

957
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
Your real father.

958
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Quietly stayed by your side and took care of you.

959
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
And you still won't acknowledge him.

960
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,080
So what?

961
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,920
There's still one last book.

962
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,680
And his own.

963
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,880
Ning actually stole paintings to sell.

964
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,040
Yours is really light.

965
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,520
Following us, it feels a bit light.

966
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,160
It's a bit weak.

967
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,520
Mine should go first, right?

968
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Yours should be the first one to open.

969
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,320
That's right.

970
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
That's exactly how it is.

971
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,080
Because our family is known for calligraphy and painting.

972
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,560
I would steal some paintings to sell.

973
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
Why would you steal paintings to sell?

974
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,240
Because our paintings are very valuable.

975
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,440
What do you need so much money for?

976
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,920
What right do you have to question my dad?

977
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,280
What a chaotic family.

978
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,400
Such a chaotic family.

979
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
This is your stepmother.

980
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm your father.

981
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm your younger brother.

982
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,640
Eldest young mistress.

983
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,320
He's just a lowly butler.

984
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,760
Bai's biological father is actually Lake.

985
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,080
I think my sister-in-law is very beautiful.

986
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I just wanted to look at her a bit more.

987
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,280
He's my son.

988
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
What's wrong with me caring about my son?

989
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,680
Is there any other evidence?

990
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,520
No, that's all.

991
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,760
Then the master's room.

992
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,880
I think after we're done searching,

993
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
we can go take a look.

994
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,560
This son's room.

995
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,920
I'm your younger brother.

996
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,320
What do you mean, my son's room?

997
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,080
What are you talking about?

998
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,640
My younger brother's room.

999
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,080
Let's go.

1000
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
He might not even be your brother, honey.

1001
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,840
He doesn't even know if he is.

1002
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,720
Honey.

1003
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,240
Right, no, just telling you.

1004
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,960
He might not be your brother.

1005
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,040
Then who am I?

1006
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
No idea where you came from.

1007
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
Do our lines have to be this mean today?

1008
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,680
Alright.

1009
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,600
Sure, we can be a bit meaner this episode.

1010
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,520
Throwing harsh words, right?

1011
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,320
Let's be a bit harsher.

1012
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,880
Take us to your son's room.

1013
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Let's check the room you often knock on.

1014
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,600
The young master's room, right?

1015
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,880
I'm the young master.

1016
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,160
You're the young master.

1017
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,080
You live in such a big room.

1018
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,200
Why should you?

1019
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,240
There's also this here—what is it?

1020
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,920
A peach wood sword.

1021
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,160
Can you understand how men feel about sticks?

1022
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,440
He grabs it and starts banging it here.

1023
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,080
Hurry up and search.

1024
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,840
Let me see what you can find.

1025
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,560
Why do you have so many drawings?

1026
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,080
Yeah.

1027
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Do you get it?

1028
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,400
The person best at drawing.

1029
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,840
Do you know what "young master" means?

1030
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,240
So many drawings.

1031
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
He's really good at drawing.

1032
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,280
There's a box here.

1033
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,080
Another box.

1034
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,440
In here

1035
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,760
You

1036
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,640
What are you doing

1037
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,200
Breaking ties

1038
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,360
In here

1039
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,400
What does it mean

1040
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
Coveting mine

1041
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,560
Let me see

1042
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,600
What does it mean, don’t you understand

1043
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,880
What does it mean, say it yourself

1044
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,600
This

1045
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,280
What is this, explain it yourself

1046
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,160
This is me

1047
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Did you do this

1048
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,800
Did I do this

1049
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,880
You’re really good at framing others

1050
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,640
I found it in her room

1051
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,400
My room

1052
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,480
Didn’t you steal that

1053
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,920
A peeper who also steals from others

1054
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,560
Tell us exactly where this thing came from

1055
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,960
Yes

1056
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,600
Where did it come from

1057
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,840
What’s going on with this

1058
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,200
A month ago

1059
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,320
I suddenly woke up

1060
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,600
Then there was someone standing next to me

1061
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,400
A very strong and handsome

1062
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,240
Man, a butler

1063
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,600
Man

1064
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
I was very surprised

1065
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
I asked, who are you

1066
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,440
Why are you lifting my blanket

1067
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah, and then I lost my memory.

1068
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,440
I asked, "Who are you?"

1069
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,240
Then he said,

1070
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,320
Yeah, he said he was my dad.

1071
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,520
He said I was the young master.

1072
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,880
You lost your memory a month ago.

1073
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,600
That's right.

1074
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,600
How many people have lost their memory, anyway?

1075
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Yeah, exactly.

1076
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
When I woke up,

1077
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,320
I was startled awake from my dream.

1078
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,040
Then Dad told me I had lost my memory.

1079
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,360
To avoid causing a commotion in the family,

1080
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:23,760
Yes.

1081
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,680
we decided not to tell everyone

1082
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,560
about my memory loss.

1083
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,880
But

1084
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,640
I kept thinking about the woman in my dream.

1085
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,360
I just couldn't get her out of my mind.

1086
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,160
I wondered if maybe

1087
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,520
there was a woman in my past

1088
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,480
who was really close to me.

1089
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,640
But I just couldn't remember

1090
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,400
exactly what she looked like.

1091
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,840
But I knew that this woman

1092
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,040
had beautiful eyes.

1093
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,680
When she smiled, her eyes curved into happy crescents.

1094
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,080
After my older brother and his wife came home,

1095
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,120
the first time I saw my sister-in-law,

1096
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,400
I thought, "Your eyes are so beautiful."

1097
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,280
They looked so familiar, just like the woman in my dream.

1098
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,520
So happy.

1099
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,240
Back then, I didn't get double eyelid surgery.

1100
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't have recognized me.

1101
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,040
And as I remember, this girl was the same.

1102
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,720
She once gave me

1103
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,320
an elephant made out of lotus root.

1104
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,200
Each of us had a token of our affection.

1105
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,080
A token of affection.

1106
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,480
Yes.

1107
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,600
Yes, but I couldn't find mine.

1108
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,360
So I went to her room.

1109
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,520
And found that token of affection.

1110
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,440
So the logic is

1111
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,840
they once had a relationship

1112
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,680
I don't know

1113
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,600
I'm not sure about that

1114
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,360
Because the sister-in-law has amnesia now too

1115
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:40,880
Right

1116
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,840
Now neither of you can prove your relationship

1117
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,720
When you saw him

1118
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,800
did he seem familiar to you?

1119
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,520
No

1120
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,280
No

1121
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,560
Son, you're not even hitting him for this?

1122
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,160
Why would you hit me?

1123
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,640
As a man

1124
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,960
you're not even taking action at a time like this

1125
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,520
Can't hit? Why can't I hit?

1126
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,360
Because I've already discovered the truth

1127
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,240
I still, in my heart,

1128
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,440
wish the best for big brother and sister-in-law

1129
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,440
Alright, then there are no more clues

1130
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,080
That's it

1131
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,680
No motive for murder

1132
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,320
What motive for murder is there?

1133
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,880
You guys go find it

1134
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,800
What motive for murder do these two have?

1135
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,640
Who would I want to kill?

1136
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,400
I want to kill big brother

1137
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,200
I don't believe it

1138
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Keep looking

1139
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,680
Keep looking

1140
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,760
There's something here.

1141
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
There's a box.

1142
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,080
This box isn't locked.

1143
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,800
Come here.

1144
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,560
Jingou.

1145
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:37,760
Hurry.

1146
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,560
Bai'ou.

1147
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,760
Jingou, Bai'ou.

1148
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,320
Come.

1149
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,520
Let me read it.

1150
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,320
April 9th.

1151
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,000
The marks on Jingou Bai'ou's neck

1152
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,360
still haven't disappeared.

1153
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,640
Luckily, no one noticed.

1154
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,280
April 26th.

1155
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,880
She actually tried to leave the house again.

1156
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
Tried to climb over the two-meter courtyard wall.

1157
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,880
Not afraid at all.

1158
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,000
Fortunately, I stopped her.

1159
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,560
I absolutely can't let her out of my control.

1160
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
May 2nd.

1161
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,880
If she tries to go out again next time,

1162
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,440
I'll have to drug her.

1163
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,040
May 4th.

1164
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,920
Once I get what I want,

1165
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,400
one more corpse

1166
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,320
wouldn't be a problem.

1167
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,960
Since you're such a villain,

1168
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,080
I have no choice but to turn you in for justice.

1169
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,440
What do you mean? Explain.

1170
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,520
You once kidnapped her, didn't you?

1171
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,560
I found out

1172
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,480
that sister-in-law might...

1173
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,520
Sister-in-law might have become the one I loved.

1174
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,960
After that, I felt really upset.

1175
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,800
So I played kickball in the yard.

1176
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,080
Then, accidentally, in a moment of anger,

1177
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,280
I kicked the ball once,

1178
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
and it flew into Great-grandfather's room.

1179
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,320
So I wanted to go in and check

1180
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,640
if anything had been broken.

1181
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,640
After I went in,

1182
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,560
I found this

1183
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,400
rope.

1184
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,240
The rope, yes.

1185
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,360
I thought the pattern on this rope was unusual.

1186
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,960
Then it suddenly occurred to me,

1187
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,440
that the day my brother and sister-in-law came home,

1188
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,680
there was a mark on my sister-in-law's neck.

1189
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,800
It was made by this rope.

1190
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,440
I found this rope in Great-grandfather's room.

1191
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,120
So this belongs to Great-grandfather.

1192
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,320
Because the pattern on this rope is very unique.

1193
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,600
Right.

1194
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,120
Ordinary ropes don't have this kind of pattern.

1195
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,440
Then I remembered

1196
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,960
the pattern on my sister-in-law's neck.

1197
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,880
I started to suspect that something was wrong with Great-grandfather.

1198
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,400
So I kept searching through the box.

1199
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,040
And then I saw

1200
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,520
that inside, it recorded

1201
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,960
all the bad things done to my sister-in-law.

1202
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,680
I understood.

1203
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,240
The motive for murder.

1204
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,040
You did it for love.

1205
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,760
No.

1206
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,560
But look at the last sentence.

1207
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,760
One more corpse.

1208
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,840
I think Grandpa isn't just targeting her.

1209
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,520
Grandpa is also going to harm others.

1210
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,160
I thought to myself,

1211
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,000
for world peace,

1212
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,200
for the justice in my heart,

1213
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,480
I

1214
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,840
have to take him down.

1215
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I have to put righteousness above family.

1216
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,560
I have to rid the people of this menace.

1217
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,000
I am

1218
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
No, it's for love.

1219
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,040
I could do it for love.

1220
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,200
But I also want to fulfill

1221
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,920
my brother and sister-in-law's love.

1222
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,720
No, he's making himself sound too noble.

1223
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,040
No.

1224
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,000
If you put anyone else in this story,

1225
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,920
if it were him,

1226
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,000
he wouldn't protect her at all.

1227
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,160
Think it through before you speak.

1228
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,480
You're even talking about patricide.

1229
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,600
I just

1230
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,880
First, it's for my sister-in-law.

1231
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,640
Second, to protect my brother and sister-in-law, right?

1232
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,560
After all, they're family too.

1233
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,360
Third, to rid the people of harm.

1234
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:27,880
Yes.

1235
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,280
I think he did it for love.

1236
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,840
For love.

1237
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,280
This extreme act was all for love.

1238
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,000
No.

1239
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,120
But he's so cruel.

1240
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,160
He has to be taken down.

1241
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,000
For the good of the people.

1242
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,200
Don't forget, my name is

1243
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,560
That makes him even more suspicious.

1244
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,400
So he's really bad.

1245
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,080
His motive is already well established.

1246
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,680
He's actually not righteous.

1247
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,640
I'm the righteous one.

1248
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,360
Okay.

1249
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,800
Anyway, it's just four words now.

1250
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,560
For the sake of love.

1251
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,080
No.

1252
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,440
For world peace.

1253
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,480
In my heart, I'm righteous.

1254
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,360
You bad boy.

1255
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,040
At first, in the living room.

1256
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,600
You were standing closest to Grandpa.

1257
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,440
Yes, the closest.

1258
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,360
And you too.

1259
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,960
And you as well.

1260
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,800
Grandpa was walking toward you.

1261
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,200
He was in the same corner as Grandpa.

1262
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,880
Her voice is so loud.

1263
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,960
Such a small body.

1264
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,360
So much energy.

1265
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,560
Next, let's go take a look at that.

1266
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,680
Dad and Mom's room.

1267
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,480
Come on.

1268
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,480
I'm the messenger of justice.

1269
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
If you all act like this,

1270
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,080
I'll have to kill you all.

1271
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,400
White De Bo Yi.

1272
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,800
Kill them all.

1273
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,440
White De Bo Yi.

1274
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,440
Master and Madam's room.

1275
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,360
The first thing that catches the eye is

1276
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,560
Just by looking at these eyes, I know they're mine.

1277
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,040
You hung it up, right?

1278
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,280
Look at you, laughing like that. Just look.

1279
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,120
You don't usually see this, do you?

1280
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,160
Why is it that in your two's bedroom

1281
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,040
there's hanging

1282
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,800
my eye

1283
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,040
Your son's

1284
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,440
This is your eye?

1285
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,040
Yes.

1286
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,560
I always thought it was mine.

1287
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,600
This is mine.

1288
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,040
Right in front of everyone

1289
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,360
Because you're my son

1290
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,200
It's normal for our eyes to look the same, right?

1291
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,320
But at a glance, this is definitely mine.

1292
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,800
You can tell it's mine right away.

1293
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
How does it blink?

1294
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,800
Wait a second.

1295
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,720
It blinks.

1296
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,800
This is so advanced.

1297
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,880
Come on, explain this.

1298
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,840
I really did hang this up.

1299
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,000
Are you two really not getting along that well?

1300
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,480
You two

1301
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,440
The master and I don't usually sleep in the same bed.

1302
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,320
You sleep in separate beds?

1303
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,200
Already living apart.

1304
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,520
Yes, it affects our sleep.

1305
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,600
The master usually sleeps on this couch.

1306
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,480
Let's search the master's area first.

1307
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,760
Under this tiger skin

1308
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,840
Everyone, pay attention.

1309
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,920
We found inside his bed

1310
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,320
something that should be

1311
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,560
a prayer bead bracelet.

1312
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,120
It's wrapped in a painting.

1313
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,040
There's a mountain drawn on this painting.

1314
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,360
A person is pointing at the bracelet.

1315
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,040
It says, "So it was you. I will take my revenge."

1316
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,640
There's an account book here.

1317
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,400
Received a deposit of twenty thousand from the old master on April 8th.

1318
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,280
Rewarded her five thousand for "Above the Moon."

1319
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,520
Rewarded him five thousand for "Good Laco."

1320
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,360
Baide Game.

1321
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,000
Heaven helps me—I found a free one.

1322
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,480
What does this mean? What deposit?

1323
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,520
Why give out rewards?

1324
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
There are also little figures here.

1325
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,880
Could this be the three of us?

1326
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,960
This is an altar, everyone.

1327
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,400
There's another little figure here.

1328
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,280
There's also a mask here.

1329
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,240
What does this mean?

1330
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,000
I didn't expect this.

1331
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,760
I didn't think you'd find out so quickly.

1332
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,160
I might as well tell you the truth.

1333
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,640
Actually,

1334
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,360
My name isn't Good Morning.

1335
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,960
My real name is just Morning.

1336
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,840
I'm just an ordinary

1337
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,120
child from an ordinary family.

1338
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,480
I was born in the morning.

1339
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,600
That's why I'm called Morning.

1340
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,240
Okay.

1341
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,680
Five years later,

1342
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,520
my younger brother was born.

1343
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,400
But unfortunately, my mother

1344
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,600
passed away during my brother's birth.

1345
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,640
She died from complications during childbirth.

1346
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,880
When I was fifteen,

1347
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,000
something even more tragic happened.

1348
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,240
One day, I woke up

1349
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,280
and found that I couldn't see

1350
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,080
or hear anything.

1351
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,080
So my dad and my brother

1352
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,040
took care of me.

1353
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,280
But when I was twenty-three,

1354
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,440
one day, a medical miracle happened.

1355
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
I regained my sight and hearing.

1356
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,520
But as I woke up, my brother

1357
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,440
developed the same hereditary disease as me

1358
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,120
and died suddenly.

1359
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,440
I was in immense pain

1360
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,360
and deep sorrow.

1361
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,240
I fainted.

1362
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,400
When I woke up again,

1363
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,760
I went to look for my dad.

1364
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,840
Someone told me that my dad

1365
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,240
had died in an accident.

1366
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,920
After your brother passed away,

1367
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,800
After my brother passed away,

1368
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,040
my father died in an accident.

1369
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,640
I was in a lot of pain.

1370
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,600
I wanted to find

1371
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,680
and then I found

1372
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,120
the place where my father had the accident.

1373
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,080
I cried there.

1374
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,720
Then a kind person came over and told me

1375
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
that at that time,

1376
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,960
he saw a man sitting in the car.

1377
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,920
The car was pushed down by someone.

1378
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,000
And the person who pushed the car

1379
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,120
was wearing a bracelet like this.

1380
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,440
It was quite unique.

1381
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,600
Because it had the word "peace" written on it.

1382
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,600
I decided I wanted to find this person and take revenge.

1383
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,480
After that, I searched for the killer

1384
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,720
while wandering around.

1385
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,080
That's how I arrived at Tuitu Village.

1386
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
This is the monkey mask.

1387
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,920
At that time, I was in this village

1388
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,000
performing martial arts on the street for a living.

1389
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,080
But during this time,

1390
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,080
a very well-dressed person

1391
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,480
came to find me.

1392
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,560
He said he wanted to hire me to do something.

1393
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,800
He said there was a couple

1394
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,520
who were especially obsessed with the culture of the Gude family.

1395
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,440
This couple

1396
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,040
is you two.

1397
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,880
Yes.

1398
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,720
What about the great-grandfather?

1399
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,920
The great-grandfather is the one who hired me.

1400
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,960
They found the great-grandfather and said

1401
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,400
they wanted to experience the Gude family.

1402
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,880
They asked him to find some people for them.

1403
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,960
The great-grandfather agreed.

1404
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,960
He said he would handle it.

1405
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,840
So I first found my classmate.

1406
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,160
So you two are just pretending

1407
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,200
You were never really a married couple

1408
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,520
Right, that's why we sleep in separate beds

1409
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,720
One day, I was walking down the street

1410
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,840
and I saw someone washing a dog

1411
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,880
A handsome young guy

1412
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
It was that handsome guy

1413
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,560
He washed the dog so clean

1414
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,520
I thought this person

1415
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,160
would definitely be good at taking care of people

1416
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,560
So I hired this butler too

1417
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,160
You're a proper butler

1418
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,520
You're a dog washer

1419
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,160
No

1420
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,920
Washing dogs

1421
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,880
Why do you look down on people like that?

1422
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,160
Why do I feel like you guys

1423
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,280
You're a professional dog washer

1424
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,560
There's nothing shameful about washing dogs

1425
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,520
No, it's your tone

1426
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,720
Your tone sounds like you're criticizing me

1427
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,840
You're just a dog washer, you are

1428
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,120
I just want to say

1429
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,400
I've already found my wife

1430
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:21,920
Found a butler

1431
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,320
Just need a son now

1432
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,680
So I wandered along the street

1433
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,360
And then in a pile of trash

1434
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,440
I saw a handsome young guy eating garbage

1435
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,840
No

1436
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,320
Of course, he was just curled up in the trash

1437
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,520
Even though he was in the trash

1438
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,720
But deep down, he had that

1439
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,960
son-like vibe

1440
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,840
a noble aura

1441
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,800
that son-like feeling

1442
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,640
He just looked like an easy mark

1443
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,280
This

1444
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,960
After the young man woke up

1445
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,040
he spoke like a "fool"

1446
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,720
He said, "Who am I? Who are you?"

1447
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,520
I was speechless

1448
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,440
"Where is this?"

1449
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,680
It's exactly the same lines you mentioned

1450
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,840
Then he fainted again

1451
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,720
I was thinking

1452
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,560
Since he doesn't remember anything

1453
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,720
When he wakes up, I'll tell him

1454
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,840
"I'm your father"

1455
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,240
"That's your mother up on the moon"

1456
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,800
"And this is your butler"

1457
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,920
So we're actually not

1458
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,040
members of the Good family

1459
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,640
The Good family members have already passed away

1460
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,440
We're a new group of people

1461
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,800
who came here to experience this

1462
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,520
Yes

1463
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,640
Later, we lost our memories again

1464
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,640
The two of us lost our memories

1465
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,240
Right, you three are the real ones

1466
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,600
You know what's going on

1467
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,880
So where did this bracelet come from?

1468
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,800
Why do I have this bracelet?

1469
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,000
It's because I went to see Old Master Gu De that day.

1470
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
He wanted to settle the bill with me.

1471
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But when I went in,

1472
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,840
I found that he wasn't in the room.

1473
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,120
I found the bracelet.

1474
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,920
I found this.

1475
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,040
Because the person I've been desperately searching for,

1476
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,320
the one who killed my father,

1477
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,960
turns out to be Old Master Gu De.

1478
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,840
I found out it was him.

1479
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,320
So I had to find a chance

1480
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,760
to get rid of him.

1481
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,200
That's right.

1482
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,040
Alright, it matches up.

1483
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,320
Your motive is very strong.

1484
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,200
Your motive for murder is too strong.

1485
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,120
Strong.

1486
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,880
Of course.

1487
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,000
Now let's look at your classmate.

1488
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,840
Alright, let's check this classmate.

1489
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,800
This lock.

1490
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,400
Where's the key?

1491
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,160
Look for it.

1492
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,360
Come on.

1493
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,440
It's fine.

1494
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,840
Bed curtain.

1495
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,560
Behind the bed curtain over there.

1496
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,280
You three useless guys.

1497
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,320
Her clue is so tricky.

1498
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,680
Why not just take it down?

1499
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,520
These two troublemakers

1500
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,360
No way, guys, is this for real?

1501
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,000
It's already gotten to this point.

1502
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,200
Found it.

1503
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,480
That was so hard.

1504
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,520
It's so packed in here.

1505
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,560
Come on.

1506
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,360
Just how many secrets are you hiding?

1507
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,600
A phone.

1508
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,560
Is this something from our era

1509
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,160
that should even exist?

1510
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,040
What's this?

1511
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,040
A Luban lock.

1512
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,920
Do you want to open it?

1513
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,600
Let me open it for you.

1514
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,280
He knows how.

1515
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,960
There's another one here.

1516
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,960
Let me check out this phone.

1517
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,920
Top NPC in the horror escape room (staff)

1518
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,280
Why is there a website?

1519
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,960
Pupil scan.

1520
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,760
This is Fuhe.

1521
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,520
Fuhe.

1522
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,000
Why are you scanning Fuhe?

1523
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,040
Wait, there's another video.

1524
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,640
Wait, what's this? Is this for real?

1525
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,480
Isn't this from a New Year's Eve gala from some year?

1526
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,040
Yes.

1527
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,680
It was sung for her.

1528
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,760
If the moon hasn't arrived yet

1529
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,720
If it's the windowsill

1530
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,280
Sit down first

1531
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,600
Sit down

1532
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,440
How do I lean over to you

1533
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,760
If you don't want this, switch to this one

1534
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,440
Come

1535
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,000
Anything's fine

1536
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Anything's fine, just use it for now

1537
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,000
Actually

1538
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,360
I'm from a horror escape room

1539
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,640
a top NPC (staff member)

1540
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,720
And actually, it's 2025 now

1541
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,080
That's why I have a phone

1542
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,280
Because today happens to be

1543
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,680
May 8th, 1925

1544
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,080
Actually, it's 2025 now.

1545
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,400
It's actually 2025.

1546
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:00,600
It's actually 2025.

1547
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,040
It's 2025 now.

1548
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,640
Yes.

1549
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,760
Why did you have to wake me from my dream?

1550
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,880
Your name is Jinhou Bai'ou.

1551
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,080
Yes.

1552
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,160
Young madam.

1553
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,240
You are the eldest legitimate grandson.

1554
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,280
The two of us already have a child.

1555
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:15,520
Yes.

1556
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,520
Only my husband and I

1557
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,240
hold hands tightly together.

1558
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:18,600
That's right.

1559
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,440
Our faces pressed closely together.

1560
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,680
The first time I saw my sister-in-law,

1561
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,480
I thought your eyes were so beautiful.

1562
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,920
No.

1563
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,640
No, I don't believe it.

1564
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,600
But I lost my memory a month ago.

1565
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,240
But fortunately, I

1566
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
have a habit of keeping a diary.

1567
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,760
So I read my diary.

1568
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,080
And I discovered

1569
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,080
that I have a boyfriend I've loved for many years.

1570
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,760
Then an image appeared in my mind

1571
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,840
A pair of eyes

1572
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,880
I could tell right away these eyes were mine

1573
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,720
Don't tell me

1574
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,480
It's me

1575
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,840
It's these very eyes

1576
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:54,880
It's me

1577
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,200
Try to sound a bit more excited

1578
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,840
Fuhe is

1579
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,880
my boyfriend of many years

1580
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,680
And usually, he is

1581
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,080
a very gentle and considerate person

1582
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,600
Yes

1583
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,560
The diary also says

1584
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,360
One day, I came home from work at the escape room

1585
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,440
It said my home

1586
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,600
Your home exploded

1587
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,680
Your home exploded

1588
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,800
My boyfriend exploded too

1589
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,440
I exploded

1590
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,120
Everything was gone

1591
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,960
I found it very hard to accept this fact

1592
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,080
I cried every day

1593
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,440
I missed you every day

1594
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,320
And because I missed my boyfriend so much

1595
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,560
I used AI

1596
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,840
based on my memories

1597
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
to recreate your voice

1598
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,080
That's why this recording exists

1599
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,160
After that, I was just muddling through each day.

1600
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,560
I couldn't pull myself together.

1601
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,880
But I thought,

1602
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,360
the person I love most definitely wouldn't want

1603
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,960
to see me so down every day.

1604
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,400
So I decided I had to pick myself up.

1605
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
I needed to find a job.

1606
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,080
Just at that time,

1607
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,960
my classmate Mo Ning came to see me.

1608
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,840
That's how I came to the Good family.

1609
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:06,880
And then,

1610
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,760
the first time I saw you as a couple,

1611
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,600
I realized

1612
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,680
his eyes

1613
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,960
looked just like my boyfriend in my mind

1614
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,840
exactly the same.

1615
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,680
Although your appearances have already

1616
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,400
become different

1617
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,800
are no longer the same,

1618
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,040
your eyes are exactly the same.

1619
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,080
That's why I made this lenticular card,

1620
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,760
so I could look at you every day,

1621
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,920
because I miss you.

1622
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,640
Because I thought he looked so much like my boyfriend

1623
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,840
especially his eyes.

1624
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,600
So I would secretly watch him every day.

1625
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,320
You spied on him while he was showering?

1626
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,400
And changing clothes?

1627
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,120
So how did I confirm

1628
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,240
that he was actually

1629
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,400
my late boyfriend?

1630
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,600
It was because of a software

1631
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,040
called "Iris Spectrum."

1632
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,920
Everyone has a unique iris.

1633
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,040
There's data stored there.

1634
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,160
I remembered

1635
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,880
my boyfriend's iris code.

1636
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,840
Then one day,

1637
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,160
while Jin Gou Bai Ou was having afternoon tea,

1638
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,440
during afternoon tea,

1639
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,360
he was napping in his room.

1640
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,680
I snuck into his room.

1641
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,400
I discovered that this man

1642
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,480
slept just like my late boyfriend,

1643
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,520
with his eyes open.

1644
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,520
I was really

1645
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,040
like Zhang Fei.

1646
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,480
So I quickly used that software,

1647
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,280
took a photo and compared it.

1648
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,360
I found that your iris

1649
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,840
was exactly the same as my late boyfriend's,

1650
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,720
a perfect match.

1651
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,920
And because I kept sneaking glances at him,

1652
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,280
I noticed

1653
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,240
this little box fell out from him.

1654
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,560
This is mine.

1655
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,520
But I've never opened it.

1656
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:42,520
Do you want to open it?

1657
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,200
Let me open it for you.

1658
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,880
He can.

1659
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,240
Let go.

1660
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,680
Let go.

1661
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,080
Let's split up.

1662
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,480
You must come find me.

1663
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:06,880
Okay.

1664
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,720
When the time comes, I'll be singing "Two Butterflies"

1665
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,720
to find you.

1666
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,160
Do you still remember how to sing it?

1667
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,760
Darling, fly slowly.

1668
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,560
Be careful of the thorny roses ahead.

1669
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,080
Didi.

1670
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,640
Good buddy.

1671
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,360
Good buddy.

1672
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,760
Good buddy.

1673
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,200
He might be a heartless man.

1674
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,920
Because he fell for a new girl.

1675
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,800
He's just faking his death.

1676
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,560
You don't even want to be with me in death.

1677
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,800
I don't remember, but...

1678
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,760
She has another clue here.

1679
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,840
What's the other one? Let me take a look.

1680
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,080
This one's a bit strange, this...

1681
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,880
There's something called...

1682
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,120
History log, amnesia search.

1683
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,960
And this.

1684
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,920
He tried to sneak out for food but I stopped him.

1685
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,200
Such a greedy boy.

1686
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,640
He tried to sneak out of the house for food at midnight.

1687
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,400
But I stopped him.

1688
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,440
Such a greedy boy.

1689
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,760
Luckily, I'm always watching.

1690
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,720
I absolutely can't let him leave the house.

1691
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,600
If he dares to run, I'll kill him first.

1692
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,960
And then she wrote,

1693
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,840
Then I must strike first.

1694
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,280
This is what I found in Great-grandpa's room.

1695
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,640
Because I've always been secretly watching you.

1696
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,760
Then I realized that Great-Grandpa was also secretly watching you.

1697
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,240
And then one day,

1698
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,840
when Great-Grandpa wasn't home,

1699
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,680
I snuck into his room to take a look.

1700
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,520
I found a laptop.

1701
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,000
It had these search records.

1702
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,080
He searched for "amnesia."

1703
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,080
And this is his diary.

1704
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,280
It records

1705
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,880
how he followed you every day.

1706
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,760
When I saw these notes,

1707
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,040
I realized he always wanted to control you.

1708
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,040
He wouldn't let you go out.

1709
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,520
If you went out, he wanted to kill you.

1710
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,560
I couldn't even eat.

1711
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,480
Right, he wouldn't let you eat.

1712
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,400
So I left a message under his notes,

1713
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,040
saying I had to act first.

1714
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,120
By "act first," I meant

1715
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,800
I had to protect you first.

1716
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,560
For love.

1717
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,360
So I've always been protecting you.

1718
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,400
Her motive for murder has already formed.

1719
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay.

1720
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,880
Actually, it's all for

1721
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,880
saving you.

1722
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:03,680
Wait a minute.

1723
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,880
She has another clue.

1724
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,400
What's this?

1725
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,320
Move aside.

1726
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:09,920
Let her sit here.

1727
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,560
I want to interrogate her.

1728
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,320
Okay.

1729
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,080
Alright, this is obviously some kind of mechanism.

1730
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,480
There's a copper coin on it.

1731
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,240
Let's try inserting a coin.

1732
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,640
See if anything happens.

1733
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,360
What does that mean?

1734
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,240
A ticket has appeared.

1735
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,880
A train ticket.

1736
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,080
From Tuishi to Pangdahai.

1737
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,920
Can you explain this?

1738
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,600
Actually, this is

1739
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,520
I vaguely remember that with the person I loved most,

1740
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,960
there was a place we really wanted to visit.

1741
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,720
I used Tongcheng Travel hidden in WeChat

1742
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,640
to book the entire trip in one go.

1743
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,920
It was fast and saved money.

1744
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,800
I booked the hotel and train tickets together.

1745
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,920
That way, I could save even more.

1746
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,920
Booking train tickets on Tongcheng is so quick and convenient.

1747
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,200
Alright.

1748
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,680
But now that person is gone.

1749
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,600
So this trip

1750
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,880
can't happen anymore.

1751
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,280
It's a pity.

1752
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,160
Alright then.

1753
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,720
Let's quickly open the app.

1754
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,880
Come on, let's continue investigating.

1755
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,720
Let's go, next we can check out

1756
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,960
the butler's room.

1757
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,680
Why are there so many coal briquettes?

1758
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,960
Why would there be so many coal briquettes?

1759
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,440
There seems to be something inside.

1760
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,760
Explosives

1761
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,440
He blew this up

1762
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,760
You blew up my boyfriend

1763
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,600
You blew me up

1764
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,720
Wait, look

1765
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,440
There's as much evidence like this as you want

1766
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,000
Tui Taiye

1767
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,840
Tui Taiye

1768
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,080
Taiye

1769
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,080
He's Tui Taiye

1770
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,960
He's not Gu De

1771
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,160
There are lots of clues

1772
01:07:59,160 --> 01:07:59,760
Let's go

1773
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,920
Be honest and you'll get leniency

1774
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,440
Close the door

1775
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,960
This phone is...

1776
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,920
He has a phone too

1777
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,120
This is kind of cool

1778
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,399
What's this picture?

1779
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,160
There's even a photo of me here, what does that mean?

1780
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,080
He already knew you

1781
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,600
There's another photo here

1782
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,200
You not only lifted his blanket

1783
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,760
You even took secret photos of him

1784
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,600
Speechless

1785
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,760
Wait, these pants are missing too

1786
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,200
You even took off his pants

1787
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:35,680
You

1788
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,399
Took off my pants

1789
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:37,840
Right

1790
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,319
He took off my what?

1791
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,520
No, it was to see the birthmark

1792
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,680
I don't need to take off my pants to show my birthmark

1793
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:48,000
My birthmark is here

1794
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,479
To see the birthmark on your leg

1795
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,920
Plastic surgery clinic

1796
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:54,880
Nook and cranny

1797
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,520
Wait a moment.

1798
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,920
This person is called Ning Zouhao.

1799
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,840
Your dad.

1800
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,160
He's my dad.

1801
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,000
Who's your dad?

1802
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,120
He's your younger brother.

1803
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,479
Probably, I guess.

1804
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,520
I lost my memory, I don't know.

1805
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,479
So there are photos of you in his camera.

1806
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,920
He's actually been watching you all along.

1807
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,359
You two should acknowledge each other as father and son first.

1808
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,399
You're also his son.

1809
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,200
I lost my memory.

1810
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,439
Originally, this matter, I...

1811
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,680
didn't want to reveal so soon.

1812
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,279
tell you all.

1813
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,479
Because I know this matter

1814
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,399
will have an impact on my two...

1815
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,840
I want to say sons—alright, I'll just say it.

1816
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,399
my dearest sons.

1817
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,360
My sons.

1818
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,080
It will cause some psychological shock.

1819
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,640
It's too much to take in.

1820
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,200
I think

1821
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,120
I'm not sure they can accept it right now.

1822
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,120
This much information.

1823
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:06,960
Can't accept it.

1824
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,880
Don't want to accept it.

1825
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,560
But that's the truth.

1826
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,720
The truth doesn't matter.

1827
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,400
What matters is that we don't accept it.

1828
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,560
My real name is Ning Zouhao.

1829
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,960
I was adopted by the Ning family.

1830
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,320
After I was adopted by the Ning family,

1831
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,920
the Ning family's daughter, Ning Mengshu,

1832
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,240
grew up with me as childhood friends.

1833
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,000
The two of us got together.

1834
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,560
After we got together,

1835
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,640
our first child, the fruit of our love,

1836
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,560
was born on a very sunny morning.

1837
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,600
That was when it happened.

1838
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,480
The first child.

1839
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:48,880
The first child.

1840
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,760
The child, hurry up.

1841
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,480
After that, I decided

1842
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,280
that we would name him

1843
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,640
Mo Ning.

1844
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,800
Mo Ning.

1845
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,120
That was in 2001.

1846
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,040
Five years later,

1847
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,600
our second child, the fruit of our love,

1848
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,720
was born on a wonderful night.

1849
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,080
So I decided to name him

1850
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,000
Yi Wu Ning.

1851
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,440
But the painful truth is

1852
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,120
that my wife, Ning Mengshu,

1853
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,320
during childbirth,

1854
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,560
because of complications,

1855
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,360
So you took your anger out on—

1856
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,080
You shut up first.

1857
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,600
and threw him away.

1858
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,160
Shut up.

1859
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,320
"Bastard!"

1860
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,560
So why am I wandering the streets?

1861
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,400
Eating from trash cans.

1862
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,200
How would I know why you eat garbage?

1863
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,880
You have a good home.

1864
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,320
I have food every day and live well.

1865
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,480
Of course, these things—

1866
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,920
Let me tell you the whole story.

1867
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,280
Right? Why are you in such a hurry?

1868
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,880
Everything was fine for us.

1869
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,520
I was doing well with the two of them.

1870
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,640
But the Ning family has a

1871
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,080
hereditary disease.

1872
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,040
Just like he said earlier.

1873
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,560
Blindness and deafness.

1874
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,920
One day, he suddenly woke up

1875
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,240
and couldn't hear or see.

1876
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,680
It was very hard for him.

1877
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,200
It was caused by this hereditary disease.

1878
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,120
He was hospitalized.

1879
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,760
My very sensible younger son—

1880
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,160
Just think, he was so young at the time.

1881
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,400
He said to me, "Dad,"

1882
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,520
"Good dad,"

1883
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,120
Reenact it.

1884
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:16,960
Reenact it.

1885
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,800
Reenact it.

1886
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,840
Call him "Dad."

1887
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,240
I can't recall, I've lost my memory.

1888
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,360
Go on, you keep acting it out.

1889
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,000
Finish what you were saying.

1890
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,960
He said I must help you.

1891
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,400
To share the burden of this family.

1892
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,840
I want to help you take good care of my brother.

1893
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
So he stayed with me.

1894
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,720
Taking care of him in this hospital.

1895
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,480
Yes, very attentive.

1896
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,640
I felt the warmth from my younger son.

1897
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,400
I said, the child has grown up.

1898
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,440
So he abandoned me.

1899
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,400
Leaving me out there on my own.

1900
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,080
That's not true.

1901
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:44,360
Living.

1902
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,760
At that moment, I felt heartbroken too.

1903
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,680
Which moment?

1904
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,320
When you...

1905
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,760
The moment you abandoned me.

1906
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,800
The moment you grabbed me and called me Dad.

1907
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,320
Until 2022

1908
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,080
our small family

1909
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,240
suffered a second major blow

1910
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,520
Yi Wuning

1911
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,840
he also fell ill

1912
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,480
By 2024

1913
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,360
the third major blow

1914
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,440
Yi Wuning

1915
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,320
his condition deteriorated rapidly

1916
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,080
he died suddenly

1917
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,520
That was on March 1st

1918
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,240
he died suddenly

1919
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,160
By March 10th

1920
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,240
he recovered

1921
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,480
By the 25th

1922
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,680
fate played another cruel trick

1923
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,280
on our small family

1924
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,000
Mo Ning received another critical illness notice

1925
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,640
he had only just recovered for two days

1926
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,200
and then had to undergo surgery again

1927
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,840
For the surgery

1928
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,520
it would cost one million

1929
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,560
For our family

1930
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,320
that was an impossible amount

1931
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,040
Before Ning Mengshu passed away

1932
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,560
she bought me an insurance policy

1933
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,040
So I thought

1934
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:40,760
to commit insurance fraud

1935
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,400
to fake my death for the insurance money

1936
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,280
get the one million and be done with it

1937
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,080
to save you

1938
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,120
So what's your plan

1939
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,240
Are there any more clues?

1940
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,440
Yes, there are.

1941
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,080
Tablecloth.

1942
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,640
Tablecloth.

1943
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,480
Tablecloth.

1944
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,600
There seems to be something here.

1945
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:00,840
Computer.

1946
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,120
There's also a computer.

1947
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,800
Happy Puppy Pet Shop.

1948
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,960
Happy Puppy, the dog washing place.

1949
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,920
Recommend the Universal Black Market.

1950
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,600
The account ID is An Shi Nen Die.

1951
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,040
An Shi Nen Die.

1952
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,040
You can buy that here.

1953
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,040
Any height or weight.

1954
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,480
It can meet all customer needs.

1955
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,160
Then he sent a portrait of Gudelake.

1956
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,240
They can do anything, the skills are top-notch.

1957
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,880
This address is the same as the one on the plastic surgery form.

1958
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,320
I went on the dark web.

1959
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,560
I bought a fake corpse at a high price.

1960
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,400
And then this kind of thing...

1961
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,480
I faked my own death.

1962
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,440
After receiving the money in the end,

1963
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,360
it would automatically be transferred to the hospital.

1964
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,880
One million was enough for his surgery.

1965
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,480
After doing all this,

1966
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,200
I went to get plastic surgery.

1967
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,840
I couldn't reunite with him anymore.

1968
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,560
Because I had completely changed my appearance.

1969
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,080
I had already become completely

1970
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,480
unrecognizable to him.

1971
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,320
I found a job washing dogs.

1972
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,440
One day, he came and found me.

1973
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,920
I came to this

1974
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,720
so-called Gudelake House.

1975
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,440
Then I discovered

1976
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:00,960
Yi Wuning

1977
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,760
was also here.

1978
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,440
After he died suddenly,

1979
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,800
I even sent him to be cremated.

1980
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,000
After the cremation,

1981
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,640
after the hospital finished the cremation,

1982
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,360
all that was left was a jade pendant.

1983
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,280
The crematorium told me

1984
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,080
that this thing couldn't be burned.

1985
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,120
That was something I gave him when he was alive.

1986
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,320
So when I saw him at that time,

1987
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,040
how could he possibly still be here?

1988
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,360
You were already cremated.

1989
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,720
That's why I went to

1990
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,200
lift his blanket.

1991
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,880
Why did I later confirm

1992
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,960
that he was my Yi Wuning?

1993
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,360
He had that birthmark on his knee.

1994
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,160
So after I saw that birthmark,

1995
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,080
I was sure it was him.

1996
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,360
No, I'm not Yi Wuning.

1997
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,520
Yi Wuning is already dead.

1998
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,920
Just to avoid being his son,

1999
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,280
you can make up anything.

2000
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,480
Because right now,

2001
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,840
from your perspective,

2002
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,680
you don't remember.

2003
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,240
He doesn't remember, we've all lost our memories.

2004
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,360
So don't say anything right now.

2005
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,520
The information you're receiving now

2006
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,120
is real.

2007
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,160
But this is how it is now.

2008
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,280
I think

2009
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,480
I'll give an example.

2010
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,480
It'll be your turn in a bit, let me go first.

2011
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,600
What do you mean, my turn in a bit?

2012
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,840
Just give an example, hurry up.

2013
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,320
Dad.

2014
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,240
Long time no see.

2015
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,120
Morning.

2016
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,080
Yi Wuning

2017
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,920
Go wait over there.

2018
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,520
He doesn't want to acknowledge me right now.

2019
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,160
What about this bomb?

2020
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,640
I am the one with the bomb.

2021
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,240
I found it at Old Master Gu De's place.

2022
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,280
He found out about my plastic surgery.

2023
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,600
Then he used it to blackmail me.

2024
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,960
He wanted me to obey him.

2025
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,760
To do things according to his instructions.

2026
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,200
What did he want you to do?

2027
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,280
I have done things for this old master before.

2028
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,520
He wanted me to go to a place

2029
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,960
called Tui Baiyi Film and Television Company.

2030
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,280
He asked me to put up six decorative paintings for him

2031
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,560
and a display screen.

2032
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,920
After I finished, I left.

2033
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,840
Once I was out, I wanted to leave.

2034
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,200
But as I was leaving,

2035
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,400
I was bitten by something

2036
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,720
that was like a monster.

2037
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,600
It bit me.

2038
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:03,720
Not long after,

2039
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,720
I completely lost my senses.

2040
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,440
I don't remember much after that.

2041
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,520
But after a while,

2042
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,160
I recovered.

2043
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,920
It wasn't until yesterday

2044
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,440
which was May 7th,

2045
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
that we

2046
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,360
had lunch together in the main hall, right?

2047
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,320
Great-grandfather suddenly called me aside in secret

2048
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,920
and said that on the 9th

2049
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,960
something big would happen.

2050
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,880
Today is May 8th,

2051
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,320
and tomorrow is the big day.

2052
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,680
He told me to be on standby at all times.

2053
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,600
So basically, all this time,

2054
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,200
I've been under his threat,

2055
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,480
forced to help him with all sorts of things.

2056
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,440
I agreed,

2057
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,400
but when he wasn't paying attention,

2058
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,920
I sneaked into his room

2059
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,440
and found this in his cabinet—

2060
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,920
the same thing I saw at the Billion Push

2061
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,280
an identical cylinder.

2062
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,400
That's when I realized

2063
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,760
that day,

2064
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,120
he wanted me to plant a bomb.

2065
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,960
He wanted to use me

2066
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,960
to blow up another place.

2067
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,080
I can't let him threaten me like this for the rest of my life,

2068
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,960
forcing me to do all his dirty work.

2069
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,320
Only the dead can keep their mouths shut forever.

2070
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,600
So,

2071
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,800
I have to make him stay quiet.

2072
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,680
The motive for the murder is complete.

2073
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,560
Right.

2074
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:06,920
Wait a second.

2075
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,760
There's something under that box.

2076
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,560
Did you see it?

2077
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,080
You've been sitting there for ages and you didn't notice?

2078
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,440
You must have a really tough butt.

2079
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,800
No, there's a painting here.

2080
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,360
There's a necklace here.

2081
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,480
And there's a cane here too.

2082
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,520
Actually, this is—

2083
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,120
Didn't both of them get sick later on?

2084
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,040
So I gave both of them

2085
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,480
a little cane each.

2086
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,640
To help them get around every day.

2087
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,560
Here, let me try it.

2088
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,800
Let me see if I can get a feel for it.

2089
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,320
This cane is pretty good.

2090
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,640
I love being with Dad the most.

2091
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,760
Blossoming flowers and prosperity.

2092
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,920
Come on, give it a try.

2093
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,920
This is my favorite game to play with them.

2094
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,440
It has nothing to do with me.

2095
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,520
You can't be so cold-hearted anymore.

2096
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,760
Facing your biological father.

2097
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:56,960
What is this?

2098
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,080
This is the necklace that can't be burned.

2099
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,080
Hurry up, blossoming flowers and prosperity!

2100
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,760
No need to try.

2101
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,880
We need to.

2102
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,320
Get out.

2103
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,880
I'm kind of speechless.

2104
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,040
Get that picture.

2105
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,320
Do we still need a picture for that?

2106
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,760
Do the three of us still need to practice this?

2107
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,640
How about this, we play with him.

2108
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,960
But each of us gives him a knock on the head in turn.

2109
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,920
Okay, no problem.

2110
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,400
So when we fall,

2111
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,200
everyone just falls to this side, and that's it.

2112
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:27,680
Okay.

2113
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,720
Alright, just slow down.

2114
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,200
Slow down.

2115
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,880
Okay.

2116
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,560
Three, two, one.

2117
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,240
Go.

2118
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,880
It's like going back to childhood.

2119
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,560
Aren't we supposed to do "blossoming flowers and prosperity"?

2120
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,680
Blossoming.

2121
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,000
Prosperity.

2122
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,120
It's like going back to childhood.

2123
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,680
What a harmonious scene.

2124
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,480
Then let's go now

2125
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,960
and gather this evidence.

2126
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,160
Then let's discuss it in the front hall.

2127
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,400
Alright, let's go.

2128
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,160
Come on.

2129
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:12,600
Let's go.

2130
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,000
Go.

2131
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,680
One by one,

2132
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,640
we've already discovered all of you.

2133
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,680
Each of you has a terrifying motive for murder.

2134
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,080
None of you have clean hands.

2135
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,520
Just now, because things were so rushed,

2136
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,800
I was caught up in your stories

2137
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,480
and kept forgetting to say something.

2138
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:43,800
I

2139
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,760
am not what you all said,

2140
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,800
not some fan of the Good family.

2141
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,640
I

2142
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
am Jin Gou Bai Ou myself.

2143
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,040
I am the wife

2144
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
of Good Fuhe.

2145
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,240
I don't believe it.

2146
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,160
Mosquito repellent patch.

2147
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,440
I have one too.

2148
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,480
Me too.

2149
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,920
The young master and young madam

2150
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,440
the two of them

2151
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,040
are a perfect match.

2152
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,320
Okay.

2153
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
This

2154
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,320
is the proof of our love.

2155
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,000
Let's stick it on first.

2156
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,560
You two should be together.

2157
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,120
Together, together.

2158
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,840
Together, together.

2159
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,400
Stick it on like this.

2160
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,280
Together.

2161
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,080
My golden hook and broken lotus root.

2162
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:53,800
Like this.

2163
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,000
Together.

2164
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,920
This is a heart.

2165
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,680
Maybe you'll say

2166
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,080
I did it while he was asleep

2167
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,840
and secretly stuck it on him.

2168
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,360
That's right, I suspect so.

2169
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,200
You could totally do that.

2170
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,160
Indeed.

2171
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:14,880
But

2172
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,000
there's a tattoo on the back of the neck

2173
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,400
that says "Love only He for life."

2174
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,280
What about the back of He's neck?

2175
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,280
Go take a look.

2176
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:28,960
What? No.

2177
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,680
Don't be so reluctant.

2178
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,200
"Love only Jin for life."

2179
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,120
So the two of us are

2180
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,080
these two people themselves.

2181
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,480
You two are people from 1925?

2182
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,560
No.

2183
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,560
Yes.

2184
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:55,720
Right.

2185
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,920
This is a very big mystery.

2186
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,080
Because we

2187
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,040
found in that old man's room

2188
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,280
a tabloid newspaper.

2189
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,840
It said that the Good family

2190
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,800
was wiped out that year.

2191
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:07,960
Actually, it was 1925.

2192
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,440
And the people in the photo are us.

2193
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,400
So why is it that in 2025,

2194
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,160
the two of us,

2195
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,360
with our birthmarks,

2196
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,720
are appearing in this era?

2197
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,920
So it's the two of you.

2198
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,600
Did you come out of the painting?

2199
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,240
Most likely.

2200
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,960
If this legend is true.

2201
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,960
You two used to be people in the painting.

2202
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,720
And returned through some opportunity.

2203
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,280
It's possible.

2204
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,040
So the rumor is true.

2205
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:39,920
It's possible.

2206
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,680
You don't even know yourself?

2207
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,520
I don't know.

2208
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,280
Then if you're from 1925,

2209
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,720
then it must be true.

2210
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,320
Right.

2211
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,960
Could it be that Great-grandpa Tui

2212
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,560
summoned us out?

2213
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,560
Right, then you're also from 1925.

2214
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,160
That's impossible.

2215
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,920
Only my boyfriend's iris

2216
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,240
matches his.

2217
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,200
Your boyfriend might

2218
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,600
be our son grown up.

2219
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,600
No, everyone has their own iris.

2220
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,040
An iris can't be replaced.

2221
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,440
Just like fingerprints can't be duplicated.

2222
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:13,920
Why does my iris

2223
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,360
have the same code as her ex-boyfriend's?

2224
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,040
There's a possibility that it's you.

2225
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,280
You came out before.

2226
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,480
And then went back again.

2227
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,240
You did come out.

2228
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:23,480
Right.

2229
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,000
It's obvious you came out.

2230
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,880
That's the only possibility.

2231
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,360
He came out for a while and lost his memory.

2232
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,440
He was with her.

2233
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,920
Then he went back again.

2234
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,960
And finally came out again.

2235
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,840
And there's another one.

2236
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,440
The part with the new girl.

2237
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,520
Let's go our separate ways.

2238
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,600
You must come find me.

2239
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,120
Whenever he wants to be with someone,

2240
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,120
he loses his memory, right?

2241
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,440
You have selective amnesia.

2242
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,840
His purpose for coming here

2243
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,920
was to meet a new girlfriend.

2244
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,000
Then go back to his wife

2245
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,280
and live his life.

2246
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,560
This time, there's no way out.

2247
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,360
His wife discovered his secret here.

2248
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,280
She came back with him.

2249
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,280
I'm a jerk.

2250
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,320
I'm a detective.

2251
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,640
What are you doing?

2252
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,840
So what if you're a detective?

2253
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,280
A detective can also have

2254
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,680
a very disgraceful persona.

2255
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,440
That's possible.

2256
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,640
We never said you weren't a detective.

2257
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,680
Right.

2258
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,880
We didn't say you were a murderer.

2259
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,760
But you are a bad man.

2260
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,480
What are you going to do about it?

2261
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,800
You're definitely a total jerk.

2262
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,160
You're definitely a total jerk.

2263
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:22,800
What are you going to do about it?

2264
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,120
I want to mess with you along with them.

2265
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,440
And just now there was a question:

2266
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,240
The keyword was that he went out to "cheat."

2267
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,040
"Cheat."

2268
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,840
What does "cheat" mean in this context?

2269
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,440
What exactly did he "cheat" on?

2270
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,320
The old man still saved you some face.

2271
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,520
I thought you were just a glutton.

2272
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,160
You’ve been out before.

2273
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,360
You had a relationship with her.

2274
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,960
So who let me out?

2275
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,240
And who put me back in?

2276
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,720
Right, that’s unknown.

2277
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,240
Actually, I’ve been out too.

2278
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,560
I also had a relationship with him.

2279
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,600
You two as a couple are really something.

2280
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,480
You love to play.

2281
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,760
Alright.

2282
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,320
Or maybe after the two of them came out,

2283
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,680
he really started dating her,

2284
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,760
and she started dating him.

2285
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,320
We kept coming out.

2286
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,160
But we lost our memories when we came out.

2287
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,880
So we started living new lives.

2288
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,960
Then one day, the master found out

2289
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,560
that these two people aren’t

2290
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,840
this married couple?

2291
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,080
Right.

2292
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:19,920
You must return

2293
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,800
to my Good House.

2294
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,120
So he made us lose our memories.

2295
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:23,920
Or something like that.

2296
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,320
She was actually half-imprisoned.

2297
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,640
Didn’t he go out and tie her up with a rope?

2298
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,600
And he was accused of sneaking out to cheat.

2299
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,240
So why did the master imprison us?

2300
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,280
Next, let’s look at this tabloid again.

2301
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,840
It says our daughter got sick.

2302
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
We had to find a way to keep her alive.

2303
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,480
So we came up with a plan.

2304
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,920
We painted all three of us into the painting.

2305
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,400
That’s right.

2306
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,560
Actually, from that moment on,

2307
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,440
the child disappeared.

2308
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,640
In fact, the two of us also entered the painting.

2309
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,040
Is that possible?

2310
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,440
Then there's a possibility that

2311
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,200
you thought that the medical skills at that time

2312
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,040
might not be able to save this child.

2313
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,720
Yes, we wanted her to first

2314
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,880
have her life frozen inside the painting.

2315
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,720
Right, and then you continued to stay with her.

2316
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,960
So that one day, when she is summoned out,

2317
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,120
there might be a chance to cure her.

2318
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,640
That's right.

2319
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,240
Yes.

2320
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,680
So your existence

2321
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,920
actually proves that this legend is real.

2322
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,920
Yes, we are not from a parallel universe.

2323
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,040
We have traveled through time.

2324
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,080
Traveled through time.

2325
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,480
We came through by means of the painting.

2326
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,000
So today, as we celebrate the birthday,

2327
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
this birthday ceremony

2328
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,080
is meant to summon back Gudebaby.

2329
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,880
I have a question.

2330
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,840
Why does Great-grandpa care so much about Gudebaby

2331
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,920
coming back or not?

2332
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,160
Yeah.

2333
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:31,960
Why is he so concerned?

2334
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,920
What is his relationship with Gudebaby?

2335
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,160
The ones who want to save Gudebaby

2336
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:36,960
are only the two of us.

2337
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,120
It's just like the secret of imprisoning you two

2338
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,960
I think it's the same.

2339
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,600
But we don't know

2340
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,400
what this secret is.

2341
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:45,920
Is Old Master Good planning

2342
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,040
to use us for an experiment?

2343
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,680
It's possible.

2344
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,920
Let's try to figure it out.

2345
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,360
His reasoning probably isn't about doing experiments.

2346
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,160
Old Master Good's goal is to make you believe

2347
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,840
that you two are still in 1925.

2348
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,880
That's why he got us to pretend

2349
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,080
and play along in this role-play with you.

2350
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,880
So he tricked you.

2351
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,560
He said there was a couple who were enthusiasts,

2352
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,320
but actually, we are that couple.

2353
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:11,760
Right.

2354
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,240
But we didn't know that.

2355
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,200
You just thought I was his father.

2356
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,480
And then your father-in-law.

2357
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,040
Alright, let's summarize again.

2358
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,720
Everyone's

2359
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,160
motive for murder.

2360
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:23,880
Motive for murder.

2361
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,720
Let's start with "Above the Moon."

2362
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,280
Why?

2363
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,480
Why?

2364
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,560
Why are you questioning me?

2365
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,640
Can't I ask her?

2366
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,280
No, you can't.

2367
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,200
You're protecting her.

2368
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:37,760
Yes.

2369
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,000
Alright, you two, stop flirting.

2370
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,600
You're going against me for her.

2371
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:44,800
Yes.

2372
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,320
Is that not normal?

2373
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,080
He'd go against you for anyone.

2374
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,640
Makes perfect sense.

2375
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,440
Now I'm completely confused

2376
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,400
about who loves whom.

2377
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,040
Don't forget,

2378
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,200
you two are a married couple now.

2379
01:28:59,200 --> 01:28:59,840
Right.

2380
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,040
We're a married couple.

2381
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,000
But I've lost my memory.

2382
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,440
And I...

2383
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,720
I don't want to acknowledge this memory now.

2384
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,960
You have to, whether you want to or not.

2385
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,000
Legally, you two are married.

2386
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,400
It's official.

2387
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,520
It's 1925 now.

2388
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,640
So what?

2389
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,880
So you want to have multiple wives?

2390
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,280
You...

2391
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,320
So that's what you were planning all along.

2392
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,560
He thought it through.

2393
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,720
So you came to the present

2394
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,200
to take all of them back with you.

2395
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,240
Then you could naturally

2396
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,240
have several wives.

2397
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,760
Right, and there's also "Two Butterflies."

2398
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,040
"Two Butterflies" refers to...

2399
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,600
the two of us, the butterflies.

2400
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,600
I can accept this character setting too.

2401
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,040
Even being a son is acceptable.

2402
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,160
What else can't I accept?

2403
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,320
Now it's the stress test segment, now it is.

2404
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,160
Then I think the culprit is probably him.

2405
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,320
Because he kept saying just now

2406
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,640
that he wants to help the two of us be together.

2407
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,400
Why would he do that?

2408
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,560
He already knows

2409
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,560
that I once dated him.

2410
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,400
It was me, but I had lost my memory.

2411
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,600
My real memories

2412
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,840
are from a hundred years ago with this person.

2413
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,400
I'm sorry, I've been losing my memory all along.

2414
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,240
I'm just using these things

2415
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,600
to guess about you and me.

2416
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,560
I think it seems even more like him.

2417
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,640
Because he is someone

2418
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,600
who was cremated but is still alive.

2419
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,520
There's a question about this point with him.

2420
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,080
That is,

2421
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,800
he never admits

2422
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,040
that he is Yi Wuning.

2423
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,120
So are you or are you not?

2424
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,120
After all this, you're still waiting for that "Big Dad" line.

2425
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,640
Big Dad.

2426
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,920
No, on one hand...

2427
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,320
Alright, then you...

2428
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,320
What was his motive for killing again?

2429
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,080
He saved me.

2430
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,520
He loves me. I'm his ex-girlfriend.

2431
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,040
I did it for...

2432
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,200
world peace.

2433
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:18,720
There you go again.

2434
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,280
Seriously, my heart is broken right now.

2435
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:23,640
He really...

2436
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,720
He absolutely refuses to admit he loves you.

2437
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:26,920
And he also refuses to admit he loves me.

2438
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,560
I really can't stand people like that.

2439
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,680
For the sake of world peace.

2440
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,160
To save all living beings.

2441
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,360
So they won't suffer from the old master's...

2442
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:37,720
slaughter anymore.

2443
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,160
See?

2444
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,600
For him,

2445
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,880
if he kills the old master,

2446
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,760
who can he protect?

2447
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,600
Who can I protect?

2448
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,040
Right, the people close to him.

2449
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,200
The ones he loves.

2450
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,120
He can only protect this one person.

2451
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,560
And the person he loves.

2452
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,560
How would I know who you are?

2453
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,840
How would I know who you are?

2454
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:02,720
What do you mean?

2455
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,000
No, I'm just assuming he knows.

2456
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,760
Just go along with him.

2457
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:07,960
That's what he's thinking.

2458
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:08,960
Okay.

2459
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,680
Just make an assumption.

2460
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,000
Your approach works.

2461
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,560
We can try working backwards like this.

2462
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:14,960
First, look.

2463
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,280
If I killed the old master,

2464
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,760
who could I protect?

2465
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,240
Think from my perspective.

2466
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,240
The person I could protect is you.

2467
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,880
So you mean,

2468
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,200
how many people do we need to protect?

2469
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,160
By this number, right?

2470
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,280
I'm telling you, each person counts as one.

2471
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,240
Right.

2472
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:31,720
Old Master Good

2473
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,600
He found out I faked my death for insurance.

2474
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,520
He wants to use this to blackmail me.

2475
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,600
I can't let him blackmail me like this forever.

2476
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,720
Only the dead will stay silent forever.

2477
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,920
Fu He is

2478
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,920
my boyfriend of many years.

2479
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,880
The diary I found in the old master's room

2480
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,640
shows he always wanted to control you.

2481
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,360
If you ever left,

2482
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,400
he would try to kill you.

2483
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,200
So I left a note under his diary.

2484
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,600
Saying I have to strike first.

2485
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,280
Someone told me my dad

2486
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,080
died in an accident.

2487
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,720
Then a kind person came to me and said

2488
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,680
my dad was pushed down by someone.

2489
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,560
The person who pushed him

2490
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,800
was wearing a bracelet like this.

2491
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,080
That day, I went to see Grandpa Gu De.

2492
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,000
I found this.

2493
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,600
So I have to find a chance

2494
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,080
to take him out.

2495
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,600
That's right.

2496
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,120
I realized

2497
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,920
the sister-in-law might be the one I love.

2498
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,080
I found this box in Grandpa's room.

2499
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:23,720
When I looked inside,

2500
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,240
it recorded

2501
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,680
all the bad things done to the sister-in-law.

2502
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,480
And Grandpa was planning to hurt others too.

2503
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,360
I thought to myself,

2504
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,680
for world peace,

2505
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,960
for the justice in my heart,

2506
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,520
I

2507
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,720
have to take him out.

2508
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,520
Alright.

2509
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,680
Let's go to X.

2510
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,960
Come on, let's confirm the X step.

2511
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,640
Let's do it.

2512
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,960
It's my favorite moment again.

2513
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,200
Next, we'll enter the X confirmation phase.

2514
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,000
Look, observe him for a moment.

2515
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,680
Why is everyone looking at me?

2516
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,720
It's a bit awkward.

2517
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,840
That smile looks a bit forced.

2518
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,840
You all forgot something.

2519
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,360
What is it?

2520
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,800
She has a card.

2521
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,760
What card?

2522
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,360
Privilege card.

2523
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,880
She has a switch that turns the other person into X.

2524
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,240
Only she has it.

2525
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,000
But she can choose not to use it.

2526
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,400
Wait, she's back.

2527
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,640
She's adjusting herself right now.

2528
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,160
Smart.

2529
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,200
Smart, really smart.

2530
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,280
I know who it is.

2531
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,720
I know who it is too.

2532
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,400
No one try to look into my eyes.

2533
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,440
Not looking at your eyes.

2534
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,840
Your actions already gave it away.

2535
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,320
Go on.

2536
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,640
What should we do, husband?

2537
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,120
We can go to the main hall first.

2538
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,840
Then go again.

2539
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,480
Search and take a look.

2540
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,840
Alright, let's go.

2541
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,120
Let's go.

2542
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,400
So there's still a box here that hasn't been opened.

2543
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,560
Try your two names, right?

2544
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,040
Right.

2545
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:28,720
Give it a try.

2546
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:29,240
No.

2547
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,480
When we first got the box,

2548
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,680
I already tried their names.

2549
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,200
Didn't work.

2550
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,120
No "Good", then what could it be?

2551
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,120
What other keywords are there?

2552
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,160
In our storyline,

2553
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,800
Whose lockbox is this?

2554
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,520
It's the master's.

2555
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,040
The master's—whose name would the master write?

2556
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,400
Why are you pouting?

2557
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,640
What's with your mouth? As soon as I see it...

2558
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,840
Who would the master write?

2559
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,040
Who would the master write?

2560
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,680
Tui Tai Ye

2561
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,800
Tai Ye

2562
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,760
He is Tui Tai Ye, not Gu De.

2563
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:15,640
Then in that case,

2564
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,320
Then it's T. Let's see if there's a T.

2565
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,760
T is...

2566
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,400
That's fine too.

2567
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,560
"Tui" is three.

2568
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,720
"Tai" is three.

2569
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,560
"Ye" is eight.

2570
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,440
That's right.

2571
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,520
Tui Tai Ye

2572
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,720
It still has to be

2573
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,560
Da Ning Zi

2574
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,120
Come on.

2575
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,200
Let's see what's inside.

2576
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,480
Certificate of Real Estate Ownership

2577
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,280
It's the property certificate.

2578
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,960
His name is Tui Taiye.

2579
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:56,880
Great-grandfather

2580
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,440
He is Tui Taiye, not Gu De.

2581
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,360
He is from 1985.

2582
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,600
Not from 1925.

2583
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,440
He's a modern person.

2584
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:07,280
So this modern person found out

2585
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,960
that there are two people from 1925.

2586
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,560
What does he want to do?

2587
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,240
Does he want our treasure?

2588
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,040
Gu De's treasure

2589
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,000
Why is the target your child?

2590
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,240
Actually, there's a question.

2591
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,520
The two of us and our child

2592
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,560
are in the same painting.

2593
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,000
Right.

2594
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,560
So after the two of us came out,

2595
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,960
our child should have come out too.

2596
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,240
It's possible

2597
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,080
that Gu De's treasure has already been

2598
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,280
imprisoned here by him.

2599
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,000
Because when we went out before,

2600
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,760
didn't we see it?

2601
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:38,800
A child

2602
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:39,680
Our daughter

2603
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,240
Yes, I think so.

2604
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,640
Dad

2605
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,760
Dad

2606
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,240
Come out and play with me.

2607
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,960
Only you can come.

2608
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,360
There's someone else over there.

2609
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,400
That place is really scary.

2610
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,000
Mom, help me tie the doll's hair.

2611
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,080
You're not my mom.

2612
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:27,920
She's not her mom.

2613
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,560
Our identities

2614
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,000
were all told to you by the old master.

2615
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,240
They could all be fake.

2616
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,600
Come back to life, my love.

2617
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,200
She really helped me bring Xiaoni back to life.

2618
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,000
But she's gone crazy.

2619
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,200
Six lines left.

2620
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,360
Delivery time to be determined.

2621
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:41,520
Just the six of us.

2622
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,400
Then we aren't crazy either.

2623
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,360
Some have gone mad.

2624
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,120
Some have lost their memory.

2625
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,320
So who would discover this thing?

2626
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,280
Everyone has a chance to get there.

2627
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,960
The one we can rule out is

2628
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:53,840
the person in the opposite corner.

2629
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
Then only Yue could do this.

2630
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,120
The four of us in this house

2631
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,200
have all been here for a month.

2632
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,120
The few of us

2633
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,320
were invited to play the role of the butler.

2634
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,320
So the information we can get is actually

2635
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,320
the same.

2636
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,120
From my perspective, it's you.

2637
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,640
From your perspective, it's me, so that's fine.

2638
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,120
You two just accuse each other.

2639
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,080
There's still a place we haven't found.

2640
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:09,920
The old master's body.

2641
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,240
Before we did this ritual,

2642
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,480
I made sure all the doors were locked.

2643
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,200
Either there's another passage,

2644
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,440
or it's just right there.

2645
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,040
Everyone has to go.

2646
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,680
This is a bit scary.
