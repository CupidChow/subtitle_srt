Now we can finally eat, I’m starving

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,840
Let’s see

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,120
I want to eat everything

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
These fish dumplings

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,240
I’ll have a portion

49
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
But I want to eat this too

50
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,560
And this one too

51
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840

I want it

56
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,600
I want one

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,280
Just try it

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay

59
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,560
Alright, let’s eat

60
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Sausage

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
This sausage is the best

62
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I want to eat yogurt curds too

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,960
This one

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,800

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,360
You can give it a try.

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,920
We come from a tradition dating back four hundred years.

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Jinshi beef rice noodles.

72
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
I am from Jinshi beef rice noodles.

73
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
The fourth-generation inheritor.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
Also from Jinshi, Hunan.

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
A chef invited from Hunan.

76
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
Yes.

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Because the production team said

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,880
that Dilraba wanted to eat Hunan rice noodles.

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,320
So we came.

80
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,560
Thank you.

81
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
Add some beef.

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
Yes, this is spicy beef.

83
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720
This will taste great.

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
Great, I want a portion too.

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,480
It's all noodles.

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,040
I think this will be delicious.

87
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,560
To be honest,

88
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,160
they are inheritors of a four-hundred-year-old shop.

89
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,720
And he flew here from Hunan just for this.

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
Shouldn't we

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,280
Is it good?

92
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,200
It's good.

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,840
It's delicious.

94
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Tasty.

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,960
Thank you.

96
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
I want some.

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,600
One bowl for each person.

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,240
Here you go, bro.

99
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Thank you.

100
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Thank you.

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,080
Did you get yours?

102
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Not yet.

103
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,040
Thank you.

104
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,280
Here, thank you.

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,680
Thank you.

106
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,400
So spicy.

107
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Do you want some stinky tofu?

108
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,040
Stinky tofu.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,760
Just one serving for me.

110
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
You can just take it.

111
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Okay.

112
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,200
Aren't you going to add some of this to the stinky tofu?

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Hurry up.

114
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,440
How do I add this?

115
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
You have to add this.

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,120
Which one should I add?

117
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,680
Just pour it in.

118
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,600
Just pour it directly.

119
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,120
Pour it.

120
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,040
It's really delicious.

121
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Can you eat cilantro?

122
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,800
Yes, I can.

123
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
You're swallowing your saliva.

124
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,560
I am actually a bit hungry.

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,240
Do you want this?

126
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,960
This is garlic. Add a bit of minced garlic.

127
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
Go ahead, whatever.

128
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,640
Okay.

129
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's go inside now.

130
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,959
Let's go.

131
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,680
Okay.

132
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
Sit further in, bro.

133
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,200
It's fine, sit down.

134
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,440
Just sit here.

135
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Just sit there.

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
Bro, you didn't take the stinky tofu.

137
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,880
I didn't take it.

138
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,400
I took one.

139
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Here.

140
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,560
Thank you.

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
These noodles are really good.

142
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,760
So tasty, and spicy.

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm going to finish this bowl.

144
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,400
Finished eating.

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,440
What's wrong?

146
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,960
This stinky tofu is delicious.

147
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,200
It's so tasty.

148
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
It really is stinky tofu.

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
The ones from Changsha taste the best.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,480
Yes.

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,320
This season, the production team gave us

152
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,040
prepared so many

153
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
delicious things.

154
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,520
Right.

155
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,920
In the first episode,

156
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
the beef tallow we had was amazing.

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,760
The one from Changsha.

158
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,560
Yeah.

159
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,640
And that hot pot, too.

160
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
This is just so good.

161
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
This one is delicious.

162
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,800
Delicious.

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
So delicious.

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
The green cake we ate yesterday.

165
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
I noticed Jin Jing really liked that one.

166
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,840
Tieshao rice cake.

167
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
No, the green cake.

168
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,840
It was labeled "Jingou Baiou."

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
No, she won it.

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Jingou Baiou is a role I won.

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Sorry, my apologies.

172
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,760
Why is this salty?

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
There are sweet ones now too.

174
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,320
But it seems like there are more salty ones.

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
The authentic ones are salty, right?

176
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,440
So salty, really salty.

177
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,920
I feel like I just ate a mouthful of salt.

178
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
That's the most authentic kind.

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,000
You can handle it, right?

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
I can.

181
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,720
I really like eating cheese.

182
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,200
What's this?

183
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,400
Yogurt curd.

184
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Yogurt curd.

185
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,440
Here, I'll have one.

186
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,800
This is tasty.

187
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
With that expression, you shouldn't have eaten the whole thing.

188
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,720
What's wrong?

189
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,720
He ate a yogurt curd.

190
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,200
It's a bit strong.

191
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,840
You try, have another one.

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,920
Bite it into pieces.

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
So, is there anything you want to wish for?

194
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,880
We can still give everyone

195
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
delicious food.

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,800
Make a wish.

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,320
Next season, I just want the golden key.

198
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,480
I don't want any food.

199
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,920
I have only one request for next season.

200
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,240
Bai Yu must come for me.

201
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I want revenge.

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Wait a second.

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,200
What's wrong?

204
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
I have a question.

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,480
Go ahead.

206
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,920
During this episode's recording,

207
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
I picked a character card.

208
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,640
It was the main character aura—where did it go?

209
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,920
Where did the main character aura go?

210
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
I have the protagonist aura.

211
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
What could this be?

212
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Looking forward to it.

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Main character aura.

214
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,480
It will be in the tenth episode.

215
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
With protagonist special effects.

216
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
They'll add special effects.

217
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
I thought in this show

218
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,440
it would be helpful.

219
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,400
So in post-production, there will be a halo above my head, right?

220
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
So beautiful today.

221
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,800
How could this happen?

222
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
How could this happen?

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,640
Every time I do my own makeup,

224
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
I think I look so pretty.

225
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,080
But when I see you, I just think

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
it's all wishful thinking.

227
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
Might end up photoshopping the face out

228
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,400
Write in a main character

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
You really look like the main character today

230
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Every move you make is like a main character

231
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Like when you were holding onto that thing

232
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,880
And your entrance and all that

233
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,039
All very spotlight-worthy

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
For the third season of "Let’s Start Reasoning"

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
The finale banquet

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
We have invited

237
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
the special chef from "A Meal to Remember"

238
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,080
our guest chef

239
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Black Pearl Michelin chef

240
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,240
Yang Yanbin

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,080
to take charge of the kitchen

242
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Welcome

243
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Welcome

244
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,120
We should really do a food and travel show

245
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
But who’s going to get you a Michelin chef every day?

246
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,960
He will present a table of Hakka cuisine for everyone

247
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Experience through the food

248
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
the culture of Dingnan Ancient City

249
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
Let’s invite him to come out

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
and bring us

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,040
the finale banquet of "Let’s Start Reasoning" Season 3

252
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,920
Thank you

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,520
Hello everyone, welcome to

254
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,840
the 455-year-old

255
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,280
Dingnan Hakka Ancient City

256
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,400
Here, there are not only beautiful sights

257
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,960
but also delicious Hakka cuisine

258
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
This time, we’ve incorporated local

259
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,600
Hakka elements

260
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
to create a table of

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,040
"Let’s Start Reasoning" Season 3 finale banquet

262
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
Thank you very much

263
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Thank you for your hard work

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Purse-shaped sticky rice

265
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,960
This is Hakka beef cooked with pickled mustard greens and wild bamboo shoots

266
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
They even specially made a goldfish.

267
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,120
That's Herlimu Jinyu.

268
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,520
Rice wine.

269
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Rice wine.

270
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
Okay.

271
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Thank you.

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,960
Thanks a lot.

273
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,560
Thanks a lot.

274
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,320
Thank you, Master Yang.

275
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
You've worked hard.

276
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Thanks for your hard work.

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you.

278
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Try it.

279
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,680
It's so delicious.

280
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
I want to make a chicken dish.

281
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,240
Is this that kind of Huadiao chicken?

282
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
It's similar, because it has a wine flavor.

283
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
The logic behind it should be...

284
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,160
No, not the logic again, that's hilarious.

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
It's just a regular chicken soup, right?

286
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,320
But the chicken itself is quite special.

287
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,040
It's made with rice wine.

288
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,680
We're going to get drunk tonight.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,480
This...

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,640
This chicken...

291
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,920
is very fresh.

292
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,560
This...

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,240
Really?

294
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,200
You have to drink it.

295
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,120
Since you said that, I have to try some.

296
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,320
This chicken is very fragrant.

297
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
So fragrant.

298
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,560
It's really tasty.

299
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,120
This...

300
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,960
This is something really special.

301
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Right?

302
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,920
Fermented rice.

303
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,040
Hakka fermented rice.

304
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,880
My taste buds have never tried

305
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
this combination before.

306
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
I haven't tried it either.

307
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,000
All these flavors are new to me.

308
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,320
Really?

309
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
I feel like

310
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,840
which one haven't I tried?

311
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,480
It's just the taste.

312
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,760
I haven't tasted this flavor either.

313
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
I haven't tasted this one either.

314
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,760
Chicken soup.

315
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

316
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,560
In the third season of "Start Reasoning",

317
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
what memorable

318
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
scenes do you all remember?

319
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
Memorable scenes.

320
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
Today is the finale.

321
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,320
Please draw the most impressive

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,560
scene from this season.

323
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
Isn't it obvious?

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,200
I really need to think about how to draw this.

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,920
A drawing genius.

326
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
I think there are two scenes.

327
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
That left a deep impression on me.

328
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
At the pool, my younger brother carried me up.

329
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,400
Then they pulled me up from above.

330
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
That feeling of us helping each other.

331
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,360
And another one is

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,280
That time we did a really high rappelling activity.

333
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,560
From such a tall rooftop.

334
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,520
It was our first time trying it.

335
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
We recorded something like this.

336
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,200
It was very thrilling and exciting.

337
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
A part of the escape room challenge.

338
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,080
It really showed our team spirit.

339
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,080
And everyone was thinking of others.

340
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,600
It also showed the friendship between us.

341
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,920
And all of our friends.

342
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,880
All have this great quality.

343
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,400
Which is helping each other.

344
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,680
This represents the salvation of love.

345
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Can you guess which scene I drew?

346
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,520
I believe I don't even need to say it, everyone knows.

347
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,600
Let them guess what it is.

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,840
Who drew this?

349
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,360
Another public shaming.

350
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,960
There's a signature. Who signed it?

351
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
I did.

352
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
It was you?

353
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,280
Yeah.

354
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,720
Look.

355
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
That's why they say in this world,

356
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
only two people signed it.

357
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,160
Guess who the other person is.

358
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,000
This is me.

359
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,560
And this is me.

360
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
No, I drew two.

361
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,920
The one on the left is us at the pool.

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,960
There are two girls and two boys on it.

363
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,080
And I'm sitting on top of Ke Yu.

364
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Yeah, I think it's unforgettable.

365
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,280
A really memorable scene.

366
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm the same as Ning.

367
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
This is me.

368
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,320
The most impressive scene for me.

369
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,280
It's

370
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,480
from the water,

371
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,120
the scene where we escaped through the attic.

372
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,200
You can tell it's someone good at math and science.

373
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,560
A real science and engineering guy.

374
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,920
He can even draw a parallelogram.

375
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,560
He even captured the sense of space.

376
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
He really got the spatial sense right.

377
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Feels like a math problem.

378
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,440
You know?

379
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,040
Is everyone drawing this?

380
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
This scene?

381
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,360
This is what I drew.

382
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
Are the five of us jellyfish or something?

383
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,600
Jellyfish?

384
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
No, what I drew is the water outlet.

385
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
I didn't draw any people.

386
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,440
Art genius.

387
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
You didn't draw people to represent your...

388
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
That we all left?

389
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,320
Yeah.

390
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
So it means we all left.

391
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
And only he was left.

392
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
No.

393
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
You didn't draw people, so you don't have anyone in your heart.

394
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,040
No.

395
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
We're not in your heart.

396
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,720
No.

397
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,800
You're hollow inside.

398
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,200
Actually, what left the deepest impression was this whole...

399
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,280
This part of the process.

400
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
What impressed you was the pool.

401
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Not us.

402
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,160
No.

403
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
I just drew this space.

404
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,160
The things that happened in this space

405
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
are all in my mind.

406
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,760
Anyone could be in there.

407
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,480
Yeah, as long as you enter that space.

408
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
As long as you're in that space,

409
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,200
it could be anyone.

410
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,240
Exactly.

411
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
No.

412
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
He's twelve years younger than you.

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,800
Sorry, little brother.

414
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
I think this drawing is really good.

415
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,280
Wow, you really have the nerve.

416
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,200
You don't have much either, give it to me.

417
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
Ten years old.

418
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
The main thing is, she didn't attack him.

419
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,440
You already seem very...

420
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
The main thing is, no one attacked him, bro.

421
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,760
This is...

422
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,520
Are these two broken kneecaps?

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
Four hands.

424
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
That moment when they pulled...

425
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,400
It's also that pool.

426
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,040
I thought this was popcorn.

427
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,880
This...

428
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,200
This looks so much like a bone.

429
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,040
That's the one Ke Yu posted on Weibo.

430
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,200
She even reposted it.

431
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,840
That picture.

432
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
This is what shocked you, right?

433
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,440
Because you were the first to share this picture in the group.

434
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah, this picture.

435
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,360
Actually, they took it really well.

436
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
That picture, yeah.

437
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,880
This is still quite meaningful.

438
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
Everyone will always reach out their hand.

439
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,440
To pull each other up.

440
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,080
Yes.

441
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll go up first.

442
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,760
Okay, three...

443
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,400
Two, one, go!

444
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,640
Go!

445
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,600
Go!

446
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,080
The people in the back all need to...

447
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
The person at the bottom has to carry others up.

448
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,160
Then those of us on top need to...

449
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,560
Give some strength to the people below.

450
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,080
Help pull them up.

451
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
No, I don't have any strength left right now.

452
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,120
Right now, I feel very...

453
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
That's why I let you go up.

454
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
You can't carry me.

455
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Let me carry you, it's fine.

456
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Come on.

457
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Come on.

458
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,240
Let's go.

459
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,920
I didn't expect the production team to arrange

460
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,000
such a realistic scenario.

461
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
It's really interesting.

462
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
It really shows our team spirit.

463
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,400
But this is truly the first time we've had team spirit.

464
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,720
Because honestly, we're just playing.

465
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,320
And then in the end, you...

466
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,920
slowly got...

467
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
when the door closed.

468
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,480
Actually, we didn't know either.

469
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah.

470
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,200
that something like this would happen.

471
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,280
Come on, give me your hand.

472
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,840
Come on, one, two, three.

473
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,040
Really didn't know, had no idea at all.

474
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
And you always feel in your heart

475
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,640
that since you're filming a show,

476
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,480
nothing bad will really happen to you.

477
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,960
But you know what?

478
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,760
Up there, we felt so empty inside.

479
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
I really wanted to cry.

480
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,160
At that moment, when you saw Ke didn't come up,

481
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
how did you feel then?

482
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,000
At that moment, I thought

483
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,200
secretly pleased

484
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,560
satisfying

485
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,440
No, he must have felt a bit down too.

486
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm telling you, he didn't say a word.

487
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
Him not speaking means he really felt

488
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,320
upset.

489
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah.

490
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,320
He used silence to answer everything.

491
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
Silence.

492
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,880
Okay.

493
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,640
Anyway, at that time

494
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,240
But it seems like, in these two seasons,

495
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,320
it's the first time we've had this kind of

496
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,760
Yeah, a fugitive-type

497
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,360
first time.

498
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Really.

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,560
But actually, through this kind of game

500
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,840
it's actually easier for us to work together

501
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,360
and it gives us more team spirit.

502
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,400
That's why so many people choose this one.

503
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Because it's a challenge for everyone.

504
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,880
Definitely.

505
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,520
Grab me, grab my leg!

506
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,880
They all succeeded.

507
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,880
That's great.

508
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,720
And then the second scene is

509
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,880
when we did the rappelling

510
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,720
I was going down with Ba

511
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,079
and Bai and He were below

512
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,720
chattering away.

513
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,560
I told them to shut up.

514
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,040
Ning, look down there.

515
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,920
Stop making a fuss, be quiet.

516
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,200
And then the girl above was crying.

517
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,480
Jin Jing saw that someone was crying.

518
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,080
Then Koyu comforted her from behind.

519
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
He held her hand.

520
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,400
My left hand

521
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,840
can't let go of this pole at all.

522
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
I'll let you hold my elbow.

523
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,880
That's fine.

524
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
Like sitting down.

525
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,880
It's okay, nothing will happen.

526
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,680
Don't worry.

527
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,760
Your foot is already on my head now.

528
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay, come on.

529
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
Alright.

530
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,520
We're here.

531
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,360
Let go, alright.

532
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,240
It's fine.

533
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Who drew this?

534
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,880
Was it Bai who drew it?

535
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,280
I drew it.

536
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,160
Because he drew his own.

537
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,880
Highlight moment.

538
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Because he was on the rope.

539
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,280
When the two of us were descending,

540
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,720
Me and He.

541
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
When we were going down, you were up there.

542
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
This season really is

543
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,720
getting more and more thrilling activities like this.

544
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes.

545
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,600
It seems like what we remember

546
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
are all these escape-type activities.

547
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,080
They'll get excited.

548
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,520
I hope everyone doesn't do that.

549
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,840
Remember these iconic moments.

550
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,400
It will make them excited.

551
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Chief Director

552
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
I'll know next season.

553
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,680
But this kind of thing is actually very tiring.

554
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,360
When recording,

555
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,640
it's really exhausting.

556
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,520
Very tiring, it really is.

557
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
They have to prepare in advance, right.

558
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,760
They also have to try several times.

559
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,600
Right.

560
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Is there anything

561
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
different besides these two?

562
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
This one.

563
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,800
What does this mean?

564
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,720
What is this?

565
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,720
I drew this.

566
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,960
This is that eye.

567
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes, it's the one pushing the glasses.

568
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,800
The whole story started with her.

569
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,360
That's how we all became friends.

570
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,120
And then a series of experiences.

571
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,680
I'm TYJ.

572
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,560
You can call me "Pushing Glasses."

573
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,480
Pushing Glasses.

574
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,000
You failed your mission.

575
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,680
There was an explosion.

576
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,760
I let you be reborn.

577
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
To investigate this place.

578
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,720
And the connection with the mysterious person.

579
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
How dare you!

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,720
But my abilities are limited.

581
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Within 40 hours of your rebirth,

582
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,640
you will still lose your memories.

583
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,400
Only after 40 hours

584
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,040
can I appear and contact you.

585
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Did you find the bomb this time?

586
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,360
The bomb.

587
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
We need to find the bomb, hurry!

588
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
When I say three, two, one, let's run together.

589
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
Three, two, one, run!

590
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,160
Congratulations.

591
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
You successfully stopped the explosion.

592
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,600
Now we know

593
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,760
who this "She" is.

594
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes.

595
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
We also know the story.

596
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
And the mystery.

597
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,160
This eye actually has a lot of meaning.

598
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,080
Right.

599
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,720
It kind of feels like

600
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,280
when we stood there scanning at the end.

601
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,200
At that moment,

602
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,120
we suddenly felt heartache.

603
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,200
Here we go again.

604
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm thinking about it again.

605
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
I finally managed to forget, bro.

606
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,880
Don't bring it up.

607
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,800
Here we go again.

608
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,920
No, just kidding.

609
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Everyone, take a look at the scene.

610
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,360
We prepared a cute trophy.

611
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,560
Where?

612
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,480
The trophy.

613
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,240
The trophy.

614
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,840
It's over there, right?

615
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
It's next to us.

616
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
On top of that, right?

617
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,640
This one.

618
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
This is Jin's. Here you go.

619
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,160
Thanks, bro.

620
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,640
No problem.

621
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,680
This one is Ke's.

622
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,160
Thank you.

623
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760
Thanks.

624
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you.

625
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,040
Thanks.

626
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
So cute.

627
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,000
The trophy just doesn't have any writing on it.

628
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,040
Where?

629
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,120
Please discuss each other's awards together.

630
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,720
Then present the awards to each other.

631
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
Zhang Linghe, how should we write his?

632
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
There's a term called "God of Sapiosexuality."

633
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Something like that.

634
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
Is it that serious?

635
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Do you want this, or what?

636
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,200
No, it's because he really is...

637
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Throughout the whole process,

638
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,880
he's very smart.

639
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,400
Actually, he's really smart.

640
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
He brings up a lot of very accurate points and perspectives.

641
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
That's hard to come up with.

642
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,800
Whose room is 141?

643
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,200
There's a key.

644
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
This key has 141 written on it.

645
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,320
Sorry.

646
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,600
The key.

647
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
It can open it.

648
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
There's a code here.

649
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,120
How about we do it mentally?

650
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,000
One thousand one hundred fifty.

651
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,680
Twenty.

652
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,200
Eight hundred eighty.

653
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
Add five hundred, add fifty.

654
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
Two thousand five hundred fifty.

655
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
You're awesome.

656
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,920
You deserve to be awesome.

657
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
There's also a phone here.

658
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
It's open.

659
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,880
He said, "Don't ask me how tall I am."

660
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,520
What does that mean?

661
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,440
The lock is a combination lock.

662
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,960
He looked at the back, it's not in inches.

663
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,000
Really.

664
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,920
118

665
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
116

666
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
234

667
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,800
It's open, come on.

668
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Let's go.

669
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
If the time at seven o'clock

670
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,280
can't be achieved,

671
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
then how did he record the video?

672
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
He must have faked it.

673
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
The background in that video

674
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,560
might have been edited out.

675
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,840
The place where the person died in the video

676
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,960
isn't where we found him.

677
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
There are traces of burnt fibers on the wrench.

678
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,120
This

679
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,720
This

680
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,880
So it's this one.

681
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
That's the first spot.

682
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,400
This is the second spot, right?

683
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,960
It extends to the first floor.

684
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,520
So control the switch on the first floor.

685
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,200
Let's go.

686
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay.

687
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,320
I'll go back.

688
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,120
What he said makes sense.

689
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,720
After one round,

690
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,080
record again.

691
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
At this point, isn't there no one here?

692
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,120
I'll just walk around again.

693
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,520
I'll just tap this person's shoulder.

694
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Then I'll walk back again.

695
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,480
You can repeat this many, many times.

696
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,440
If he wants you to kill someone,

697
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
he has to know

698
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
who this alternate account belongs to first.

699
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,560
Only then can he

700
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,600
take that death tag

701
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,040
and accurately

702
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,640
swap it with the tag of that alternate account.

703
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,120
These two killers might be

704
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,040
So, if you two

705
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
didn't see this thing,

706
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,960
that means you two

707
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
aren't affected by this symptom.

708
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
But before I inhaled the poison,

709
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
I already knew I was going to use this to commit the crime.

710
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,040
So I would know where that thing is.

711
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,640
After he was hallucinated,

712
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,360
he wouldn't know

713
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,600
what kind of hallucination he had.

714
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,080
Right.

715
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,960
If I'm the killer,

716
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,840
before I inhale the drug,

717
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,280
I know I'm going to use this dough today

718
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,920
to kill him.

719
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,960
So I know the dough is here.

720
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
You just need to knead the dough.

721
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,480
Even if I inhale the drug

722
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,360
and see it as a black ball,

723
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,120
I know it's actually dough.

724
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,560
I can just pick it up and hit him with it, right?

725
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,480
Why would I need to go through

726
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
the same process as you guys

727
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,960
of pretending to be hallucinated

728
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,800
and then

729
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
fake killing him again?

730
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,160
I think what he just said was right.

731
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,520
I think it's him.

732
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,880
He passed by in that women's outfit.

733
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
Then he pulled this person down.

734
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
He played a role.

735
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
Then came back here.

736
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
If I were Aguai,

737
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,240
I would have disguised myself as a woman before.

738
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,440
I would do what's called "face-changing."

739
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,880
I have this skill, and it's very well developed.

740
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,680
After Jin Pengyou replaced Aguai,

741
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,960
Why is this related to face-changing?

742
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,240
What we need to discuss is before the replacement,

743
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
who resembled Aguai more.

744
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
After the replacement,

745
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,240
who has Jin Pengyou's traits.

746
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,120
Just now,

747
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,040
there was a recording in my room.

748
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,720
It was

749
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,200
"If you think of me,"

750
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,240
"you must sing 'Two Butterflies.'"

751
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,480
Go listen to the recording again.

752
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,280
The recording says,

753
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,240
"When I come to find you again,"

754
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,160
"I will definitely be singing"

755
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,880
"'Two Butterflies' when I come to find you."

756
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Right.

757
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,000
It's not saying "when I think of you,"

758
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,800
"I sing 'Two Butterflies.'"

759
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,760
Don't change a single word, or you'll change the whole meaning.

760
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm supposed to sing the song when I go to find her.

761
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
His reasoning is all correct.

762
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,320
Yes.

763
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
But the result is wrong.

764
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,880
What prize do you want to win?

765
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,720
You guys help me think.

766
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
Help me think.

767
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,760
How did it become just me thinking?

768
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,040
Alright, let's leave it at that.

769
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Smart Suction Love

770
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,200
This one works.

771
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
Let's go with Smart Suction Idol.

772
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,120
Smart Suction Idol

773
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Okay.

774
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,160
This one's good.

775
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,040
That works.

776
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,080
It's your turn.

777
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,520
What do you think, Ba?

778
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,960
Cute You

779
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,000
If you just write "Cute Girl,"

780
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,240
This is a bit...

781
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,800
Isn't that too perfunctory?

782
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,920
Sounds like a QQ username.

783
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
Cute Girl

784
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Cute QQ Girl

785
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,640
You can't do that.

786
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,240
Like, you came and recorded a whole season,

787
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,120
and everyone says, "This person is cute."

788
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,360
But you really are cute.

789
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,200
Both cute and funny.

790
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,680
So lame.

791
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
She makes us love to laugh.

792
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,680
No, it's because she brings us so much joy.

793
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
We love her because she's adorable.

794
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,960
Loves to laugh.

795
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,400
The laughter is from us.

796
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,160
She brings us a lot of laughter.

797
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
Got it.

798
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
I think there's another point.

799
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
She has a very, very sharp

800
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,440
sense of insight.

801
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Insight.

802
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,760
Her reasoning ability.

803
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,320
Sometimes, before we even understand

804
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,400
how the whole crime was committed,

805
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,720
she uses her intuition

806
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
and can already figure out

807
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
who the suspicious person is.

808
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,440
If I write down everything you just said,

809
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,520
if I write it all down,

810
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,600
it seems a bit long.

811
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,720
When others haven't reacted yet,

812
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
she's always the first

813
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
From what I know about her,

814
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
she probably wouldn't like this.

815
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,600
Bro, based on what you know about me,

816
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
come up with one for me.

817
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,360
I actually think there's something to it.

818
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,960
For example, he said "girl who loves to laugh,"

819
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,680
No, I think she's a girl who loves to cry.

820
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,080
Like, loving to cry is her thing.

821
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Then call her the "Crying and Laughing Goddess."

822
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,920
I'll call myself "Crying and Laughing Helplessly."

823
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,000
That works.

824
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,160
I both cry and laugh.

825
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,880
But I still can't get the golden key.

826
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,000
I like this one.

827
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,080
I like this one.

828
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,960
Crying and Laughing Helplessly.

829
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,200
I really can't take it anymore.

830
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm really about to faint.

831
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
I really want to cry.

832
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,080
I've been looking for you all this time.

833
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,840
Back then,

834
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,800
we were kidnapped and taken to that crazy island.

835
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,360
You disappeared, and I...

836
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm so touched, I want to cry.

837
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,000
How did you grow up?

838
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,840
You're so good-looking.

839
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,040
Don't laugh.

840
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,640
Yeah.

841
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,840
You have Dilraba's side profile.

842
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm "going crazy."

843
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,960
You're so relaxed.

844
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,080
But still so handsome.

845
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
So impressive.

846
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,320
So awesome.

847
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,680
Yuning, Yuning.

848
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,600
You're really the best.

849
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
So good-looking.

850
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,800
I get lost just looking at your face.

851
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,520
No.

852
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,280
Except for the two detectives,

853
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,280
no one else can question me.

854
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,160
If I catch anyone lying,

855
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,600
I'll immediately lock onto the culprit.

856
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,280
They probably didn't take anything from me.

857
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,080
Take anything from my body.

858
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Because I'm still this fat.

859
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,800
Everyone who had something taken became thinner.

860
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,800
No.

861
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,760
She's alive.

862
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
Started with zero frames.

863
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,840
I'm here.

864
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm here.

865
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
I am the cruelest punishment here.

866
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,680
I find her funny.

867
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
You all laugh at me.

868
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,680
But I'm the funniest one.

869
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
Alright, that's fine.

870
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,280
Best "laugh or cry" award.

871
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,400
That's fine.

872
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,680
It has to be you, bro.

873
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,760
Very nice, I like this.

874
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,360
It's your turn.

875
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,720
Then I am...

876
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,040
Laughing and crying, right?

877
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,280
Laughing and crying, right?

878
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,920
You just have to laugh.

879
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Have to laugh.

880
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,240
You just have to be bad.

881
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,480
He just has to love.

882
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Alright, "have to."

883
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,040
Let's go with this.

884
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
Okay, write it like this.

885
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm speechless.

886
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,560
She's already used this method.

887
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
When it's her turn, she needs to change the tone.

888
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,720
We can still come up with something better.

889
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,440
After finishing this season, what do you all think...

890
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,840
About Ba's...

891
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
What's your biggest impression?

892
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
It's quieter.

893
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,880
When I don't know something,

894
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,960
I just don't speak.

895
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,120
Sometimes I really don't know.

896
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,160
But as soon as she speaks, she can say something.

897
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,720
Yes.

898
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,760
There's a password.

899
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,480
Is the password 8888, by any chance?

900
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Really.

901
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,160
Really.

902
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,600
He probably can't do it in three minutes.

903
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,840
I want to ask.

904
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
Three minutes.

905
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,880
Just the conveyor belt alone takes that long.

906
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,600
And then you have to set him in place.

907
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,440
It's just that usually,

908
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,560
he takes a lot of supplements, right?

909
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:43,960
Yes.

910
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
Is it possible

911
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,840
that this "Tui Qianlang" is actually still alive?

912
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,320
He killed his own son.

913
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,840
And lived on using his son's identity.

914
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,680
Guys, I feel like

915
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,920
we're all people on this island.

916
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,280
This old man, Ren Weishan,

917
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,480
look, he even has beauty and medical treatments.

918
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,600
To make these people live forever,

919
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,000
they take things from us.

920
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,880
So they can be immortal.

921
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,120
You're amazing.

922
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,080
I am X.

923
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,960
Because each of you contacted me.

924
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,120
Whose message to you was the most suspicious?

925
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,280
All five of you sent messages.

926
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,960
A little after 8 p.m.

927
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,600
He was already biting himself.

928
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:22,920
So,

929
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
before he was

930
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,480
crushed or stabbed to death,

931
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,880
he was already brain dead.

932
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,160
The little brother is everyone's little brother.

933
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,960
No.

934
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,440
Don't worry, no one knows.

935
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm your subordinate.

936
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,400
I can help you with the matching rings.

937
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,120
Just these few people.

938
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,560
Well, I happen to have a car.

939
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,240
You have a car?

940
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,200
Brother Cheng

941
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,320
She—do you speak Thai?

942
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,800
Come on, do it again.

943
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,560
What?

944
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,920
What is it?

945
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,520
He is Ling Ling Fa.

946
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,360
Badi

947
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,160
Badi

948
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,560
Hello, Badi.

949
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,440
This is Diba.

950
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Okay, I see it.

951
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,880
Over there.

952
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,960
Hurry.

953
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,200
Your fur is so soft.

954
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,160
Wait a moment.

955
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,640
Hug.

956
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,000
So you really were laughing on the side the whole time.

957
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,920
Who said I was always laughing?

958
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,120
Then you just couldn't help but laugh.

959
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah, I really couldn't help it.

960
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
I think it's reasonable to not be able to hold back laughter.

961
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,720
Because whenever she sees Jin Jing,

962
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,680
she just can't stop laughing.

963
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,800
And sometimes, when someone tells a joke,

964
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
she actually reacts the most.

965
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,880
Yes, that's right.

966
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,040
He Jiawei

967
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,920
Jiawei

968
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,960
King of Support

969
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,120
What about Ke?

970
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,640
Can't Help But Love

971
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,360
He really can't help but love.

972
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,400
He really can't help but love.

973
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Can't Help But Love

974
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,360
He wants it.

975
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,560
He wants this name.

976
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,120
Alright, let's go with this one.

977
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,520
No.

978
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
He wants it.

979
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,080
Wait a second.

980
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
You guys...

981
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
I see you guys are at it again.

982
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,920
I didn't start.

983
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
We're just writing this name for you.

984
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,520
It's fine, then let's pick another one.

985
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,640
If there's nothing better, we'll go with this.

986
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,520
No, I accept.

987
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,000
No, I mean I accept.

988
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
He means you accept.

989
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,760
You want it.

990
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,240
You want it.

991
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,800
You want it.

992
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,200
Once you see him, you can't help but love him.

993
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
Falling for this group's bully, right?

994
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,880
Group bully.

995
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,440
He's not the group's favorite, he's the group's bully.

996
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,760
Just now, a very suspicious person ran by.

997
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,400
They found a body.

998
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,480
And he didn't even stop them.

999
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,000
You can't even catch a person in black.

1000
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
And you want seven thousand?

1001
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,760
What hard work did you do?

1002
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
You did nothing, just stood there.

1003
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

1004
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
I think it's because I beat you up.

1005
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,960
That beating.

1006
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,800
It messed up your brain.

1007
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,320
Let me tell you.

1008
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Just to get

1009
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,040
those two cheap

1010
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,720
skins.

1011
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,160
Stand up.

1012
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,200
What about you?

1013
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
Then why did he invite—

1014
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
None of your business.

1015
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,520
We should just—

1016
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Wait a second.

1017
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,200
You look so greedy.

1018
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,000
You're obsessed with money, aren't you?

1019
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,120
No, I'm looking for clues.

1020
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I didn't take her money.

1021
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,000
This is yours.

1022
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,800
Yeah.

1023
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,560
It's over, bro.

1024
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,880
Bring up the rear.

1025
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
You're just a dog washer.

1026
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,480
Dog washer.

1027
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,800
You're nothing special.

1028
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,520
Did you help Bafentang hold the clothes?

1029
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,400
Did you help Bafentang hold the clothes?

1030
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Yes, I did.

1031
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,159
You're such a great person.

1032
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,920
Don't say that.

1033
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,600
Why are you so nice?

1034
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,239
It's hot.

1035
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,840
Water.

1036
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,400
Thank you.

1037
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,679
This amnesia of yours

1038
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,159
what key role does it actually play?

1039
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,239
Thank you.

1040
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,760
Thank you.

1041
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,679
I'm a security guard.

1042
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,760
Let me carry you.

1043
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,280
It's okay, come on.

1044
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,000
Hurry up and go.

1045
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,360
Hurry.

1046
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,400
You go first.

1047
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,760
Are you scared?

1048
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm scared too.

1049
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm also nervous.

1050
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,640
Of course.

1051
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,560
This is pretty high.

1052
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,280
Actually, I'm afraid of heights.

1053
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,840
23:47 is the time of the crime.

1054
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,600
Right?

1055
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,720
Why is it 23:47?

1056
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,280
Because...

1057
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,720
Why did you hit him with a black ball?

1058
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,800
It was clearly a peeled egg.

1059
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
It was all said by 23:47.

1060
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,880
So this killer

1061
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,000
was smashing things at 23:47

1062
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,080
After smashing, he held ice

1063
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,640
His hands were covered in frostbite

1064
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
I need to apply this ointment

1065
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,400
Exactly three minutes later

1066
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,080
which is 23:50

1067
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,400
when everyone regained their memories

1068
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,440
you saw my hands were perfectly fine

1069
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,560
Right

1070
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,560
Let's have a toast

1071
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,800
Cheers

1072
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,280
Cheers

1073
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,040
Cheers

1074
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,360
Okay

1075
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,400
You two are still enjoying the fruits of victory.

1076
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
The logic of this killer is

1077
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,600
the person who actually did it is the killer,

1078
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,280
or is it

1079
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,320
the one who directly caused the death is the killer?

1080
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,440
If we follow that logic,

1081
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,840
what if I found someone really stupid,

1082
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,800
should I teach you about this or not?

1083
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,120
If I incited you,

1084
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,560
wouldn't I still be considered a murderer?

1085
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,480
Why is it only the one who directly caused the death

1086
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,400
who is considered the murderer?

1087
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,080
I think your logic is too weak.

1088
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
But the fact that he (Ning Que Wu Lan) killed someone

1089
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
is something those two don't know.

1090
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,840
Only you two know about it.

1091
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,400
How would we know?

1092
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,040
You also know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) switched people.

1093
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,480
I didn't know he (Ning Que Wu Lan) switched people.

1094
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,760
Because before I went to find him (Ning Que Wu Lan),

1095
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,000
I didn't even know who he (Ning Que Wu Lan) was.

1096
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,200
Then it's obvious.

1097
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,800
This person must be one of the more powerful people

1098
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
in this Snake gang.

1099
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,640
Who, in this matter,

1100
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,320
is actually leading and driving the whole thing?

1101
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,280
Who started all of this?

1102
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Because of her.

1103
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,720
After all, he's twelve years younger than me.

1104
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,080
He's twelve years younger than us.

1105
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Reba, he's ten years younger than you.

1106
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,240
No need to mention it.

1107
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

1108
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,720
Thirty years younger than you.

1109
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,520
No, thirty years younger than you would be something.

1110
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
Right, so basically,

1111
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,280
it means he's the one we all pick on in the group.

1112
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,960
And that makes us have to love him.

1113
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,680
Yes.

1114
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,720
Alright.

1115
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,320
Have to love.

1116
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,640
Then I guess I have to be bad.

1117
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Can I ask you not to be bad?

1118
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,280
Don't feel like you have to be bad.

1119
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
Or else,

1120
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,440
Can you write these four characters?

1121
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,160
They are "turn over a new leaf, start fresh."

1122
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,440
"Turn over a new leaf."

1123
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,600
"Start fresh."

1124
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,320
No.

1125
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,640
I have an idea too.

1126
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,360
Best hollow man.

1127
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
What is that? What?

1128
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,320
Hollow man.

1129
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,680
Then now he has a heart.

1130
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,320
Is he saying

1131
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
Right, you actually have a heart now.

1132
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,280
Call him "kind-hearted boy."

1133
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,600
I agree, Love Boy.

1134
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
You should be called Love Boy.

1135
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I really am...

1136
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,040
Come on.

1137
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Write "Love Boy" for him.

1138
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
I have to make sure this thing

1139
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
shows up in his house.

1140
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
Such an artistic home.

1141
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,320
It's full of books and ancient texts.

1142
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
Ancient texts.

1143
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,120
No books, sorry.

1144
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,200
Love Boy.

1145
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,480
He likes things clean.

1146
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,680
Those moves just now,

1147
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
he was the one who saved us.

1148
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,880
He did it on purpose to win our favor.

1149
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
Killer.

1150
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
The real culprit is Bai Hanzi.

1151
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,960
I suddenly don't recognize this person anymore.

1152
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,520
Don't cry.

1153
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,840
I'll go back and block him on WeChat.

1154
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,840
You're so happy, Bai Yu.

1155
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,280
I was so mad that when I got back in the car, I...

1156
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,480
They're already eating candy.

1157
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,000
There must be.

1158
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,840
They're even eating wedding candy.

1159
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
It must be the two of them.

1160
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,280
You open it.

1161
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
The password is my birthday.

1162
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
I know your birthday, I...

1163
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
I'm so sad.

1164
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,280
You really treat him like a brother.

1165
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,560
He's a "hollow man."

1166
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeah.

1167
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,000
Go save the boss, I'll go up first.

1168
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm a little unsure.

1169
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,320
You're so good at this.

1170
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,720
If you really tricked me today,

1171
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
I'll truly hate you for the rest of my life.

1172
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm telling you,

1173
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,640
A Jin,

1174
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,160
A Ba,

1175
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,320
You take the director away.

1176
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
Then you two go up first.

1177
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,800
I think

1178
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,760
it's time for me to do something

1179
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,040
for this team.

1180
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll hold them off here.

1181
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,560
You two go up.

1182
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,600
Sir, that's very noble.

1183
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,040
We'll go up later and find a way to save you.

1184
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,760
I'll let it bite me.

1185
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Because I've already been bitten once.

1186
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,160
It doesn't matter.

1187
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,800
Okay, just let it bite you.

1188
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,520
Come back while it's biting you.

1189
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,280
Honestly, I feel like lately

1190
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,200
you've been less able to let go.

1191
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,920
Because you talk more and more in the group.

1192
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
That's right, that's right.

1193
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,640
I think it's because of us,

1194
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,200
all of us here,

1195
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
we warmed up this hollow person.

1196
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,120
We filled his heart.

1197
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,040
At a certain moment, you all

1198
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,920
made me feel like I actually had a heart.

1199
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm about to cry.

1200
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,280
A caring boy, or someone with a heart.

1201
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,960
He changed from a hollow person to someone with a heart.

1202
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,840
Let's go with "someone with a heart."

1203
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,680
I think this will always remind me.

1204
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,960
Alright, that's fine.

1205
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,880
Sure, "someone with a heart" works.

1206
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,400
Okay, someone with a heart.

1207
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,880
Someone with a heart.

1208
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,080
Big Ning

1209
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,960
Why am I here?

1210
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,120
You must write well for Big Ning.

1211
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,080
Why not?

1212
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,840
I think

1213
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,880
Can I

1214
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,040
Thank you.

1215
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,080
There are too many aspects.

1216
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,040
I can't cover them all.

1217
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
Forever the big brother.

1218
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,120
Boss is mighty.

1219
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,560
Best hype boss.

1220
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,440
No.

1221
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,880
Hype bro.

1222
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,920
Can't help but get hyped.

1223
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,400
Big Head bro.

1224
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,720
Big Head bro.

1225
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,880
Big Boss Head.

1226
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Head Boss.

1227
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
Old Big Head.

1228
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,480
Bro.

1229
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,400
It's not fun anymore.

1230
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,960
Then let's stop playing.

1231
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,320
Ning really is like a big brother.

1232
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,880
Summarize it yourself.

1233
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,440
Instead of just repeating what we just talked about

1234
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,040
and saying it all over again.

1235
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,960
Although Ning has partnered with me a few times,

1236
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,240
the two of us became like Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong.

1237
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,960
But in my heart,

1238
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,240
I have great respect for him.

1239
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,640
Because he truly

1240
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,960
is tolerant of all of us younger brothers

1241
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,280
and all the younger siblings

1242
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,720
and the sisters' emotions.

1243
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,240
Right?

1244
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,440
So in my heart, he is a great big brother.

1245
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,720
I think my big brother

1246
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,440
I think my big brother

1247
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,240
will always be a great big brother.

1248
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,040
But he will also always

1249
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,800
be very

1250
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,720
captivating to us as a big brother.

1251
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600
But I think his captivating nature

1252
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
is truly because he cares for us.

1253
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
Yes.

1254
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
Next, let's go to the work area

1255
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,680
of you four suspects

1256
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,520
and search it.

1257
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,840
Please don't call us that.

1258
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,640
Okay?

1259
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,440
You four prisoners are the most...

1260
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,400
I'll smash this bowl.

1261
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
I'll use that razor blade to cut my face first.

1262
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
After cutting it open, tie it up inside.

1263
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,120
Then hang this thing up there.

1264
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,920
When the time comes,

1265
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,040
it falls onto the face.

1266
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
At that moment, he dies.

1267
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,360
Rolls down.

1268
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,000
Rolls down.

1269
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,960
That works too.

1270
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,000
The logic is reversed.

1271
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,800
The logic is reversed.

1272
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,720
This is the most reasonable explanation so far.

1273
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

1274
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,080
I'll just do my best

1275
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,040
to ruin this gathering.

1276
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,840
What makes you think

1277
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,960
it's a choice between you two?

1278
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,640
Why?

1279
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,360
I think only the culprit can be sure.

1280
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,440
Both people have been ruled out.

1281
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,520
That doesn't mean I have a strong personality.

1282
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,640
That I have followers.

1283
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,600
I don't have a strong personality.

1284
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm an honest person.

1285
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,240
But I'm the one who calls the shots here.

1286
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,960
Is that okay?

1287
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,240
Just you.

1288
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,320
You only talk.

1289
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,360
You don't take any real action.

1290
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,320
Two people deliver things.

1291
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,440
Things.

1292
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,640
Things.

1293
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:47,840
Things.

1294
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,040
Things.

1295
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,880
The electrician is here, everyone.

1296
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
Take it apart.

1297
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,480
Unplug it.

1298
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,080
I am your "dad."

1299
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,880
That's right.

1300
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,640
How dare you!

1301
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,280
Don't forget who you are, son.

1302
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,960
You dare to criticize your father at a time like this?

1303
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm a detective.

1304
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,080
Even if you were the emperor himself,

1305
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
you're still my son.

1306
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,320
Dad.

1307
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,240
Long time no see.

1308
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,080
Morning.

1309
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,560
(In) the bathroom.

1310
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,840
Why did you put our front door...

1311
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,680
Is my home a public restroom or something?

1312
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,640
I live in the bathroom.

1313
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Do you know the difference between humans and machines

1314
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,880
is?

1315
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,120
When a machine receives evil,

1316
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,880
it returns evil.

1317
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,480
But you are human. When you receive evil,

1318
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,720
you should respond with kindness, love, truth, and beauty.

1319
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,280
Go and awaken everyone.

1320
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,040
That's right.

1321
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
I think humans are inferior to machines.

1322
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,680
What did we do wrong?

1323
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,760
When you were locked up and almost suffocating over there,

1324
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,120
we were here, worried sick.

1325
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,520
We wanted to save you.

1326
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,960
That was your own choice.

1327
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,920
You didn't have to save me.

1328
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,360
You hate humanity so much,

1329
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,080
that's right.

1330
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
why don't you kill yourself?

1331
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,720
The real culprit is

1332
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,560
Bai Hanzi.

1333
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,200
Let me tell you,

1334
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,560
you really

1335
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,040
almost took me away today.

1336
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,800
I kind of want to cry right now.

1337
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,880
You almost took me away today.

1338
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,080
I kind of want to cry right now.

1339
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,280
If I don't get it right this round,

1340
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,160
if I guess wrong again,

1341
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,040
I won't come to record next time.

1342
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,720
Here, come.

1343
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,680
Let's go, come on.

1344
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,080
Don't go down.

1345
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,320
The rest of us will fight down below.

1346
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,480
You stay up here and keep watch for us.

1347
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,520
Okay.

1348
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,320
You guys aren't dead.

1349
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,880
Yeah.

1350
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,640
You brought us here.

1351
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,040
When we were looking for the cameras,

1352
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
what were you acting out over there?

1353
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,680
Because I was scared

1354
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,120
that I wouldn't be able to be friends with you anymore.

1355
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,920
When you guys died just now,

1356
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,600
I cried so hard.

1357
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,560
I was afraid of losing this friendship.

1358
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,440
It's okay.

1359
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,040
Bai Yu

1360
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,480
The two of us are twelve years older than Zhou Keyu.

1361
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,200
We are twelve years older than you.

1362
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,800
I suddenly feel a bit guilty.

1363
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,160
We didn't really look after him this season.

1364
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,160
Can we go in and play?

1365
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,000
If the girl wants to catch a toy, let them do it.

1366
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Right?

1367
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,040
Then,

1368
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,240
You go ahead, I'll hold this first.

1369
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,200
Nice, that was really accurate.

1370
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,200
It's okay, there are more, try again.

1371
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,960
I want to eat peanuts, bro.

1372
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,000
Buy them.

1373
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,400
Okay, here you go.

1374
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,160
I also want that puffed snack.

1375
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,760
Get one of each.

1376
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,400
Thanks, bro.

1377
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,720
Our great big brother.

1378
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,000
He does it for us, the ones above.

1379
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,560
A really good big brother.

1380
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,840
So if you shorten this, it means...

1381
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,080
I thought big brother was crying.

1382
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,360
Turns out he was just wiping oil from the corner of his mouth.

1383
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,640
But let me tell you,

1384
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,560
when you all went out today,

1385
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,960
I seriously held Big Brother's hand

1386
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,400
and asked him something.

1387
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,920
I reflected on myself.

1388
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,800
Because I said, Big Brother,

1389
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,080
the personalities we both have,

1390
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,920
are they hurting everyone or helping everyone?

1391
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,400
Do you know what Big Brother said to me?

1392
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,480
What did he say?

1393
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,280
He said,

1394
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,400
this is the role we're meant to play.

1395
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,360
Forget about whether we're right or wrong.

1396
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,040
Always remember

1397
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,520
the role you play in this team.

1398
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,480
Just do your part well, and that's enough.

1399
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,320
I was really moved by how great he is.

1400
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,280
That's what makes him Big Brother.

1401
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,920
Yeah.

1402
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,640
Big Brother also told me

1403
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,160
that ever since the second episode last time,

1404
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,560
he also went back and reflected on himself.

1405
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,040
But after thinking a lot about it,

1406
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,800
he felt

1407
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,640
the role I play in this team

1408
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,760
is exactly that of Big Brother.

1409
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,600
When everyone is lost,

1410
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,520
I should step up

1411
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,400
and set the pace.

1412
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,600
Get the atmosphere going.

1413
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,520
Even if I lead in the wrong direction,

1414
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,760
you all can blame me.

1415
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,960
Stop, actually I...

1416
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I don't know, I'm getting a bit emotional.

1417
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,160
I'm really emotional right now.

1418
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
I'm about to cry.

1419
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,080
It's nothing.

1420
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,320
Okay, I understand. Got it.

1421
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,960
Understood, Jin.

1422
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,720
Got it, I understand.

1423
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,840
Understood.

1424
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,960
I kind of want to cry.

1425
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,800
Those two are done for.

1426
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,080
What are you doing?

1427
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,160
It's nothing.

1428
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,360
I don't believe I'm actually this good.

1429
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,000
But when I see her like this,

1430
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,960
You really are that good.

1431
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,000
You're really great.

1432
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,440
Actually, when I saw Ning yesterday,

1433
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,840
he mentioned the ranking for the key.

1434
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,960
When Ning was in last place,

1435
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,520
I almost couldn't hold back my tears.

1436
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,800
Yeah.

1437
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,000
But then I thought, forget it.

1438
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,800
This is a fun show.

1439
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,360
I don't want to get into all that emotional stuff.

1440
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,000
Right.

1441
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,440
No, I think the reason Ning was last

1442
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,040
is because of something.

1443
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,720
It's just like we said earlier.

1444
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,760
Actually, he is

1445
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,160
always putting others first.

1446
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
He's a really good big brother.

1447
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,560
A really good big brother, right?

1448
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,360
Yeah, come on.

1449
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,680
Always putting others first.

1450
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,080
Yes, that's right.

1451
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,600
Yeah, everyone knows what that means.

1452
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,400
I’ve been really happy on this show.

1453
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,680
Getting to know all of you as friends

1454
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,000
No matter what I say,

1455
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,320
you’re always willing to go along with me.

1456
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,440
I’m truly grateful to you all.

1457
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,480
In a bit, let’s act a little dramatic when we get out of the car.

1458
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,080
Like, maybe adjust your clothes or something.

1459
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,440
Let’s get out one by one.

1460
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,560
Then line up and walk forward together.

1461
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,760
Okay.

1462
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,680
Let me plan it out for you.

1463
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,800
When you get out, hold onto this like this.

1464
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,840
Can we walk with that kind of

1465
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,880
heir-like vibe?

1466
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,360
Can we?

1467
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,080
Just walk up slowly.

1468
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,440
Then turn back and chat and laugh, like that.

1469
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,040
Your drone will be flying over there.

1470
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,360
We’ll film ourselves walking.

1471
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
You two do it like this.

1472
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,040
In front of the camera,

1473
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,520
open up to both sides.

1474
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,800
Okay, got it.

1475
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,320
I really appreciate how you’ve always been

1476
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,840
so supportive.

1477
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,360
I’ve suggested some really childish things,

1478
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,400
and you’ve all been willing to join in.

1479
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
You never killed my vibe.

1480
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,280
You made being on this show so much fun.

1481
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,360
Thank you all so much.

1482
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,800
Next, we’re going to announce

1483
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,480
this season’s MVP.

1484
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,720
Who is it?

1485
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,000
Based on everyone’s votes each episode,

1486
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,480
we’ve tallied up the MVP list for the season.

1487
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
The one who received four MVP votes is

1488
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,560
The one who received four MVP votes is

1489
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Zhou Keyu.

1490
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,640
The MVP with seven votes is

1491
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,480
Zhang Linghe

1492
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,880
Dilraba

1493
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,360
Little Didi

1494
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,920
That's actually quite a lot.

1495
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
Seven times, seven people voted for you.

1496
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,600
Next, the MVP with ten votes is

1497
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,840
Bai Yu

1498
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,960
Bai Yu

1499
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,440
I guessed it right.

1500
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,680
You

1501
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,600
Bai Yu

1502
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,480
The MVP with eleven votes is

1503
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,400
Jin Jing

1504
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,920
I want my brother to be number one.

1505
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,240
Jin Jing

1506
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,640
My brother

1507
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,680
Cried too soon.

1508
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,800
Cried too soon.

1509
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,200
What you just said should have been said at this moment.

1510
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,520
It would have been instantly elevated.

1511
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,400
The MVP with thirteen votes is

1512
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,000
Liu Yuning

1513
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,960
You won in our hearts.

1514
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Do you understand?

1515
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,880
Big brother

1516
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,000
Big brother, come quickly.

1517
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,320
It wasn't in vain.

1518
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:27,560
You know, right?

1519
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,000
Why did you circle me in the middle?

1520
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,680
What's this for?

1521
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,560
You need a hug too.

1522
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,600
Come here.

1523
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,400
Big brother

1524
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,120
Bro

1525
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,560
Hair

1526
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,440
My hair got caught

1527
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,720
My hair—wait a second

1528
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,640
Why did you suddenly do this?

1529
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,160
No, wait

1530
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,640
Don't move yet

1531
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
Zhang Linghe

1532
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,360
Can you stop causing me trouble?

1533
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,720
It's here, right here

1534
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,880
I can't see

1535
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,680
Move back

1536
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,240
I'll move back

1537
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,520
Don't rush

1538
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,560
It's done

1539
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,480
Zhang Linghe

1540
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,000
Can you stop causing me trouble?

1541
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,320
Next,

1542
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,880
we will now cast

1543
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
the MVP vote for episode ten

1544
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:11,920
Come on,

1545
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,320
Let's go,

1546
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,840
Three,

1547
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,600
Two,

1548
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,320
One.

1549
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,840
Liu Yuning.

1550
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,800
Liu Yuning.

1551
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,440
It's really you.

1552
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,680
Yes.

1553
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,640
It really is you.

1554
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,280
I also picked you in private.

1555
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,720
Let's vote publicly.

1556
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,520
It's a public vote.

1557
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,000
Yes.

1558
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,960
There's nothing we can do about it.

1559
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,960
Just follow the majority.

1560
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,640
Go with the majority.

1561
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,760
Alright.

1562
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,120
Then I won't be polite.

1563
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,240
Liu Yuning received a total of eighteen votes.

1564
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,000
He becomes this season's Most Valuable Player.

1565
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,760
Big bro!

1566
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,480
Boss!

1567
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,120
Boss!

1568
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,040
I almost cried, I'm about to cry.

1569
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,720
Big bro!

1570
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,400
Boss!

1571
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,040
Do a dance!

1572
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,840
Do a dance!

1573
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,680
What is this?

1574
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,320
Do a dance!

1575
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,960
Not bad.

1576
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,600
You also get an extra golden key.

1577
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,240
Thank you.

1578
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,080
I'm happy.

1579
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,720
Next up, it's time for

1580
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
the Star of Tui City award ceremony.

1581
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,560
Star of Tui City.

1582
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,520
Star of Tui City.

1583
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,720
That's the first place on our Golden Key ranking.

1584
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,280
And this ranking as well.

1585
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,520
Aren't they tied for first place?

1586
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,480
You let me win.

1587
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,680
I think it's me.

1588
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,080
Your "sudden realization" acting just now was really good.

1589
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,480
I think it's me.

1590
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,160
Yeah.

1591
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,080
That's ridiculous, right?

1592
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,720
This season's Golden Key ranking.

1593
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,720
Please look at the screen.

1594
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,080
Let's have the staff

1595
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,640
bring up the Star of Tui City Golden Key.

1596
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,680
Congratulations to both of you.

1597
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,080
Congratulations.

1598
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,080
Thank you.

1599
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Congratulations to both of you, congrats.

1600
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,880
Congratulations to both of you.

1601
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,480
You take it.

1602
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,680
I already got it last time.

1603
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,520
Acceptance speech.

1604
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,760
Congratulations.

1605
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,640
It's still this.

1606
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,880
I didn't keep the promise I made at the start.

1607
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,440
Which was

1608
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,160
not to let Bai Yu get first place this season.

1609
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,680
But he still got first place anyway.

1610
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,720
Yeah.

1611
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,160
Alright.

1612
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,240
But I'm still really happy.

1613
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,680
Yeah.

1614
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,240
Happy.

1615
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,600
The four of us weren't mentioned at all.

1616
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,360
Only Bai Yu was mentioned.

1617
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,560
Why should we even bring him up?

1618
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,840
He has nothing to do with the four of us.

1619
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,320
I thought...

1620
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,120
Go ahead.

1621
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,320
The atmosphere was just getting built up.

1622
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,240
No, that's not it.

1623
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,080
Really, it's just that...

1624
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,080
You need to understand one thing.

1625
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,880
When others mention you,

1626
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,920
they expect you to mention all five of your brothers and sisters.

1627
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,040
You should mention everyone.

1628
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,120
But you only mentioned one person.

1629
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,600
That makes the other four feel awkward.

1630
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,240
Do you know that?

1631
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,120
Do you know what our show

1632
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,680
"Start Reasoning" is about?

1633
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,680
What are the two key words?

1634
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,720
It's not just about the two of you

1635
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,120
and your little group dynamic.

1636
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
No.

1637
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Ke Yu can't save you now.

1638
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,120
I can't help you either.

1639
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,760
Absolutely not.

1640
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,720
He's not saying anything, so here's your chance.

1641
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,840
You know what to say now, right?

1642
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,240
Take the microphone.

1643
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,560
Rephrase what you want to say.

1644
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,120
This season,

1645
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,000
Okay.

1646
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,960
It's just that...

1647
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,240
It's all thanks to us,

1648
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,600
the Herlimoyu Detective Team's...

1649
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,400
the Herlimoyu Detective Team's...

1650
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,920
Herlimoyu.

1651
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,760
You just left me out completely.

1652
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,960
That's even more outrageous.

1653
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,280
Let's do it again.

1654
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,880
This one just cuts someone out directly.

1655
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,640
Expulsion

1656
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,160
Let me redo it, redo it.

1657
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,560
Redo.

1658
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,240
Redo.

1659
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
After this episode is finished,

1660
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,360
he plans to kick you out.

1661
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:13,840
Yes.

1662
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,760
He's not satisfied with you.

1663
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,160
He's implying something else.

1664
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,080
You have to figure it out yourself.

1665
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,120
Let go of me.

1666
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,960
Don't pull me.

1667
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,320
You're holding too tightly.

1668
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,880
He Li touches Jin Yu.

1669
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,840
All members of the detective team

1670
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,240
worked together.

1671
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,480
They helped you get up there.

1672
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,320
What did we even work for?

1673
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,720
We all chose wrong.

1674
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,800
All our efforts were for nothing.

1675
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,400
Whatever you say now is wrong.

1676
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,480
I was wrong.

1677
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,560
I was wrong.

1678
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,480
I have no heart.

1679
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,960
When you first came here,

1680
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,200
did you think you could get this?

1681
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,320
I didn't even think about it.

1682
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,760
I did get it in the second season, that's true.

1683
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,600
But I really didn't expect it this season.

1684
00:55:59,600 --> 00:55:59,840
Okay.

1685
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,680
But you played really well.

1686
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,960
Whether you played the killer

1687
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,800
or played a civilian,

1688
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,880
No, I can't say that.

1689
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,200
Or played as X,

1690
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,280
It's not that I played well.

1691
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,280
It's the older brothers and sisters

1692
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,080
who played badly.

1693
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,280
Right?

1694
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,480
We were just ignorant.

1695
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,360
No.

1696
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,000
It's all thanks to the comparison with our peers.

1697
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,280
Alright, that's fine.

1698
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,080
Thank you.

1699
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,560
Before we officially finish for the day,

1700
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,480
there's one last segment.

1701
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:22,920
Okay.

1702
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,880
During the Tencent Video "V You Customization" event,

1703
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,960
our VIP members

1704
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,400
also have many questions they'd like to ask you.

1705
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,640
Let's take a look at the questions from the audience

1706
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,000
who have been with us all season.

1707
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,400
What questions do they want to ask,

1708
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,320
and what wishes do they have?

1709
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
They want to ask the He Li Mo Jin Yu Detective Team,

1710
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,040
through the filming of this season,

1711
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,320
have you learned any new skills?

1712
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,040
In what areas have you improved yourselves?

1713
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,200
What ability did you gain?

1714
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,080
I learned

1715
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,560
the ability to argue.

1716
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,680
You learned how to argue?

1717
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,520
Ever since you joined, we've been arguing every day.

1718
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,280
You're not arguing,

1719
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,640
you're picking fights every day.

1720
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,480
Ask them.

1721
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,920
Did we ever argue in season two?

1722
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,840
We actually argued very little.

1723
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,840
In the latter part of season two,

1724
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,640
the debate segments weren't that intense.

1725
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,480
That's right.

1726
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,520
Really.

1727
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,440
That's how it was, yes.

1728
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,000
We were all relatively friendly.

1729
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,600
It's just that it wasn't so

1730
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,640
like today, where our faces are about to explode.

1731
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,560
Turning purple from anger like that was pretty much impossible.

1732
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,440
At the end of last season

1733
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,640
it always ended quietly.

1734
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,320
It just didn't feel right. I thought it was him.

1735
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,440
And then it was over.

1736
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:24,680
Yeah.

1737
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,480
But if I had to say,

1738
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,040
I feel like our whole group has

1739
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,640
improved our debating skills.

1740
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,240
It's like

1741
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,520
Yeah.

1742
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,800
and we can reason things out

1743
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,080
and have gotten better at reconstructing the whole crime process.

1744
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,760
Everyone.

1745
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,120
This season, for every case,

1746
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,560
we've been able to fully figure it out in the end.

1747
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,320
What actually happened.

1748
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,360
Reconstructing the crime.

1749
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,800
Yeah.

1750
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,440
And we have to reconstruct it,

1751
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,240
like we won't stop until we do.

1752
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:47,800
Right?

1753
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,240
Yeah, we don't leave any doubts.

1754
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,480
Yes, that's right.

1755
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,080
I want to ask Bai Yu,

1756
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,720
do you think being the culprit is more fun

1757
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,840
or is being X more fun?

1758
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,400
Which round did you do the best at reasoning this season?

1759
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,040
I think being a civilian is the most fun.

1760
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,320
Because there's no pressure,

1761
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,800
You feel pressure when you're the culprit?

1762
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,960
What kind of pressure?

1763
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,120
His pressure is probably

1764
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,280
that he feels guilty.

1765
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,080
Like, "It's over today,"

1766
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,400
"I have to lie to Da Ning again."

1767
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,640
It's really tough for me.

1768
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,080
That's his only burden.

1769
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,600
Not really.

1770
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,600
No.

1771
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,040
This definitely isn't the case.

1772
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,280
I can feel that this isn't happening.

1773
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,320
His burden is that he's afraid of losing.

1774
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,280
Yes, that's it.

1775
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,360
I'm someone who really wants to win.

1776
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,000
I have a very strong desire to win.

1777
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,720
Especially when I get

1778
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,640
Actually, when I get the "murderer" role

1779
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,760
or the X card,

1780
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,640
my desire to win should increase even more.

1781
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,840
My competitiveness goes up another notch.

1782
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,520
It doubles.

1783
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,720
It suddenly skyrockets, yes.

1784
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,360
So I think

1785
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,520
whether it's the murderer or X,

1786
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,120
I think

1787
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,640
they're both fun.

1788
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,280
As long as I win, it's always really fun.

1789
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,680
Bafentang has streamed before.

1790
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,840
So she's very logical about this.

1791
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,920
She realized this place is basically

1792
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,160
a huge live streaming set.

1793
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,280
When those two talk,

1794
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,280
they keep looking into each other's eyes.

1795
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,520
Can you two pay a little more attention?

1796
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,800
You need a green screen, right?

1797
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,400
Outside the serving window,

1798
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,240
aren't there a bunch of green boxes?

1799
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,840
The real culprit is

1800
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,880
Bafentang.

1801
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,240
Someone put this poison

1802
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,480
into the syrup

1803
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Someone poisoned his wine glass

1804
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,160
Is that possible

1805
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,120
If that's the case

1806
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,520
Could it be three people then

1807
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,200
Because he ended up dying in the water

1808
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,520
Isn't that unnecessary

1809
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
The killer must have known

1810
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,800
that if I put the poison in the syrup

1811
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,920
he would definitely eat it

1812
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,320
Familiar with his habits

1813
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,480
The real culprit is

1814
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,760
Baizhihua

1815
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,800
Me

1816
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,920
is She’s father

1817
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,520
Only good people would be afraid to say it

1818
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:33,960
Wait a minute

1819
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,760
I'm not sure

1820
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,400
Yes

1821
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,360
Yes

1822
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,600
Except for yourself

1823
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,800
You know you’re a good person

1824
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,400
Yes

1825
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,000
First impression, bro

1826
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,560
The three of us

1827
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,440
So one of you is She

1828
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,600
One of us is She

1829
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,640
There is She

1830
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,320
Take out those four

1831
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So you used this to threaten him

1832
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,240
Trying to get the boss to pay you

1833
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,760
What

1834
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,640
Nothing

1835
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,600
Not yet

1836
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,200
Yes

1837
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,520
Is there more

1838
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,760
This was found in his doll

1839
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,600
It was discovered

1840
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,240
I'm afraid he'll kill me.

1841
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,880
How do you know he wants to kill you?

1842
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,080
I feel like something's off about this.

1843
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,920
But that comic card...

1844
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,720
It has the four of us on it.

1845
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,000
All four of us are alive and well.

1846
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,800
Why do you think

1847
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,240
that just because of this comic card, he would

1848
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
prove that he wants to kill you?

1849
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,280
So he saw two of them.

1850
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,440
One of them is a woman.

1851
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,800
The fluorescent person.

1852
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,600
We're all test subjects with serial numbers.

1853
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,240
Qi Ji.

1854
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,120
Serial number.

1855
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,120
CA7749.

1856
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,400
Qi (Ji).

1857
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,120
Yes, that's her.

1858
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,200
It was her (Ba Mian Linglong) who switched yours in advance

1859
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,680
and changed it to the Death Reaper.

1860
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,600
Then when you went to the office and saw it,

1861
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
you wondered, "Why am I the Death Reaper?"

1862
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,280
And it even says on it...

1863
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,200
But among them,

1864
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,520
the one who caused a friend's death

1865
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,840
is actually completely under my control.

1866
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,240
So basically, this is using someone else to do the killing.

1867
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,640
If I come over from here

1868
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,040
the person I tag is

1869
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,280
who?

1870
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,520
The culprit.

1871
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,920
You pretend to be the elder, you go.

1872
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,200
I'll go.

1873
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,880
Go over and tag Yue.

1874
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,560
Tag Yue out.

1875
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,440
Yue goes over.

1876
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,280
Then you move a bit over there.

1877
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,320
Just a little.

1878
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,320
Just a little.

1879
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:17,800
Then I go.

1880
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,240
How is that possible?

1881
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,000
Go.

1882
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,320
I find that no one is here.

1883
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:21,920
Then you

1884
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,760
I'll go back again.

1885
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,520
He returns to this

1886
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,720
correct position.

1887
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,200
At the end,

1888
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,720
whoever is there is the culprit, right?

1889
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,920
It's you.

1890
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,400
See, you finally found a spot

1891
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,120
to trap me.

1892
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,600
You searched for so long.

1893
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,760
I'm speechless.

1894
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,440
No, that's just how he is.

1895
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,520
He explained it to me today.

1896
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,480
Why he always plays so seriously.

1897
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,600
He said, "Ning-ge,"

1898
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,240
"Even though I'm the killer today,"

1899
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,080
"Even though I lied to you,"

1900
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,640
"but I want to say,"

1901
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,080
"this is the greatest respect I can show you."

1902
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,880
"Because giving it my all"

1903
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,280
"is how I respect my opponent."

1904
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,360
I treat him as a friend.

1905
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,200
He treats me as a rival.

1906
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
But I accept that.

1907
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,800
Alright.

1908
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,000
You need a good rival in life.

1909
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,560
Ba.

1910
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,040
In this season,

1911
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,720
which segment did you like the most?

1912
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,600
Or is there anything

1913
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,080
you're hoping the show will add next time?

1914
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,400
My favorite part is the horror segment.

1915
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,960
You really like it?

1916
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,920
You broke my bucket.

1917
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,240
I'm really addicted to it.

1918
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,000
I just want to play those scary ones.

1919
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,040
I want to ask Jin Jing.

1920
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,760
Jin Jing, Zi Ze.

1921
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,320
Compared to last season,

1922
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,960
does this season feel scarier and more exciting?

1923
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,840
This season really is scarier and more exciting.

1924
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
I remember

1925
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,840
someone said to "make it spicier and more numbing."

1926
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,040
It wasn't scary enough.

1927
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:54,480
So give it to him.

1928
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,360
"Make it spicier and more numbing."

1929
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,960
It all ended up on me.

1930
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,240
But I didn't dare open my eyes.

1931
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,880
I really couldn't take it anymore.

1932
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,840
I was about to faint.

1933
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,040
I really can't take it.

1934
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,840
I need to protect my heart.

1935
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,560
The boomerang you threw

1936
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,600
somehow hit me right on the forehead.

1937
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,680
It all landed on me.

1938
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,320
Especially these last two episodes.

1939
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,440
Yeah, it was so scary.

1940
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,600
My throat—

1941
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,120
My throat is hoarse from shouting.

1942
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,200
Did you have fun this season?

1943
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,720
Liu Yuning,

1944
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,360
do you think everyone in the Helimo Jinyu team

1945
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,280
has made any progress in any areas?

1946
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,320
What are your expectations for the next season?

1947
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:50,760
Of course I had fun.

1948
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,320
Of course I had fun.

1949
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,800
I was really sincere just now.

1950
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,920
Could you feel that I was sincere?

1951
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:55,880
Ba is absolutely right.

1952
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,880
It's about how familiar everyone has become.

1953
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,760
Now we dare to joke around.

1954
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,600
And even

1955
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,120
dare to playfully hit each other.

1956
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,960
Playfully hitting is okay, but still just average.

1957
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:03,960
Just—

1958
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,160
Still just average.

1959
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,000
Next season, let's start with an uppercut when we meet.

1960
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,920
Alright, let's start recording.

1961
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:11,520
No.

1962
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,840
It's just that everyone has become more familiar.

1963
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,280
Whether it's reasoning ability,

1964
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,200
the ability to find clues,

1965
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,320
the ability to reconstruct the scene,

1966
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,640
including the final defense skills,

1967
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,040
they've all improved a lot.

1968
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,040
This season was really fun.

1969
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,400
It felt really happy, too.

1970
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,520
No regrets.

1971
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:23,880
No regrets.

1972
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,680
Looking forward to the next season.

1973
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,800
I just hope it will be "spicier and more numbing."

1974
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,920
"Spicier and more numbing."

1975
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,040
There you go again.

1976
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,440
Alright.

1977
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,240
No.

1978
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,720
The "numbing" and "spicy" you add,

1979
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,480
can you not put them in my bowl?

1980
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,520
"Spicy girl."

1981
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,400
"Spicy girl."

1982
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:41,800
"Spicy girl."

1983
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,240
Zhang Linghe

1984
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,200
I want to ask, after you finished filming the second season,

1985
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,040
did you cram

1986
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,120
any detective or mystery knowledge or works?

1987
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,200
If so, what did you watch or read?

1988
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,240
Can you recommend any?

1989
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:53,440
No.

1990
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,680
I crammed on how to argue with others.

1991
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,200
Really?

1992
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:57,960
Really.

1993
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,960
The most frustrating thing about the second season was

1994
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,520
I had no idea what to say

1995
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,680
and couldn't out-argue you all.

1996
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,080
Especially that one person.

1997
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,760
At the end of the second season,

1998
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,080
I remember my closing words were

1999
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,040
Next season, I must

2000
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,040
definitely

2001
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,640
vote for Bai Ge.

2002
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,160
Just wait for me next season.

2003
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,040
Watch how I "take you all down."

2004
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,040
I didn't expect this season

2005
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,360
he would win first place again.

2006
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,440
That's my biggest regret.

2007
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,480
Neither of your wishes came true.

2008
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,520
Couldn't beat him.

2009
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,360
Yeah.

2010
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,120
But I also gained a lot this season.

2011
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,520
We became closer.

2012
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,160
That's the most valuable thing.

2013
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,640
Yes.

2014
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,520
The most worthwhile thing.

2015
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,800
Yes.

2016
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,960
This is

2017
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,840
the most precious.

2018
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,760
Yes.

2019
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,520
May I ask Zhou Keyu,

2020
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,840
I remember Keyu said that filming "Start Reasoning"

2021
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,320
was the happiest and most relaxing time.

2022
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,720
It felt like escaping from the real world.

2023
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,320
So if you return to the real world,

2024
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,640
what do the older brothers and sisters mean to you

2025
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,280
in terms of their roles?

2026
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,560
That's a good question.

2027
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,680
What do they each mean to you?

2028
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,440
Don't just talk about Bai Yu.

2029
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,080
I know.

2030
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,680
The older brothers and sisters will all be sad.

2031
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,120
Okay.

2032
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,240
Because of the twelve-year-old rule.

2033
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,120
What happened just now wasn't your fault.

2034
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,080
But let's talk it through properly this time.

2035
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,000
The previous one already deducted the twelve years.

2036
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,720
Do you understand?

2037
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,320
Okay.

2038
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,160
It's just that the two of them and I

2039
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,920
actually met during the first season.

2040
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,520
After we finished recording the first season,

2041
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,000
we didn't see each other again.

2042
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,240
Actually, during the recording,

2043
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,080
maybe we were

2044
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,000
working in different places.

2045
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,200
Then we could come to this place

2046
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,000
and see all of you.

2047
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,720
That's something very special for me.

2048
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,920
Because

2049
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,560
everyone

2050
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,400
actually doesn't have it so easy in private

2051
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,040
to all gather together neatly.

2052
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,800
And even if we do get together,

2053
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,840
we might not have the chance

2054
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,080
to be able to

2055
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,120
do an escape room together,

2056
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,120
or solve mysteries,

2057
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,280
or debate,

2058
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,440
just to be happy and laugh together,

2059
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,360
or even argue together.

2060
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,560
This is really rare.

2061
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,800
After leaving this show

2062
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,400
I might see Ning again

2063
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,120
I remember one time

2064
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,520
I saw him at an event

2065
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,760
There was a period

2066
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,360
when he was injured

2067
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,360
He had a fracture

2068
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,760
At that time, he was

2069
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,640
also at an event

2070
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,560
dressed in a suit

2071
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,080
It actually felt quite different

2072
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,680
That's why I described it as two different worlds

2073
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,680
to explain this situation

2074
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,200
So after the show ended

2075
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
when he saw you

2076
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,840
he pretended not to know you, right?

2077
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,400
No

2078
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,560
It's just that we

2079
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,480
No

2080
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,480
No

2081
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,200
No

2082
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
No

2083
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,200
It's just that we

2084
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:18,560
No

2085
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,080
No

2086
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,560
No

2087
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,480
That's not what I meant

2088
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,280
What does he mean then?

2089
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,640
Like, for example, on the show

2090
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,680
we do reasoning together

2091
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,800
and record the show together

2092
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
But if you see me in private

2093
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,400
and say hi, I might just say, "Get lost"

2094
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,280
It's not like that.

2095
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,240
After it's over, just like I said,

2096
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,000
I actually don't know when

2097
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,960
I'll be able to be in a situation like this again

2098
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,680
and see you all again.

2099
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,480
When I see you all again,

2100
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,800
maybe the feeling will be like

2101
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,600
what I just described,

2102
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,040
I just don't know how to put it into words.

2103
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,360
It's not about good or bad.

2104
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,360
For example, when I see Bai Yu again,

2105
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,800
I once went to see his movie roadshow.

2106
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,240
I saw him in the movie,

2107
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,360
he was playing a character.

2108
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,680
He felt a little unfamiliar to me,

2109
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,880
but also so familiar.

2110
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,440
Yeah.

2111
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,000
Then he talked about his character on site,

2112
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,360
talked about his crew,

2113
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,480
and stood together with another group of people.

2114
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:06,960
I understood.

2115
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,520
He wasn't the same person as the one in front of you now.

2116
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,080
Right.

2117
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,480
You get it, right?

2118
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,320
That feeling is really different.

2119
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,800
The most familiar

2120
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,640
stranger.

2121
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:16,840
That's what I mean.

2122
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,040
It kind of feels like that.

2123
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,080
When we're together, it's like a ball of fire.

2124
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,840
When we're apart, it's just a pile of matches.

2125
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,200
When we're apart, it's just little matches.

2126
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,880
Yeah.

2127
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:28,760
For me, Ba Jie is

2128
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,560
someone I always look forward to seeing.

2129
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,800
It's the same even at work.

2130
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,439
Yeah, because actually,

2131
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,479
I've liked her a lot for a long time.

2132
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah.

2133
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,040
I only learned about our company because of her.

2134
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,680
I searched for her name.

2135
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,240
That's how I found out about our company.

2136
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:48,920
Yes.

2137
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,200
You've inspired so many people.

2138
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,960
Like lighting a match.

2139
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,359
That's right.

2140
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,200
Jin-jie

2141
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,720
Actually, we only got to know each other in the second season.

2142
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,399
The feeling I get from Jin-jie is

2143
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,840
very warm.

2144
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,600
When I'm around her,

2145
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,960
like when I'm around Bai-ge,

2146
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,960
I get a similar feeling.

2147
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,359
I feel very safe.

2148
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,960
She often jokes around with everyone.

2149
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,520
She makes these kinds of jokes a lot.

2150
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,000
But deep down,

2151
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:19,120
she always thinks about

2152
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,680
taking care of everyone's feelings.

2153
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,479
And yesterday, she gave each of us

2154
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:24,800
a gift, I think.

2155
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,319
Right?

2156
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:25,960
Yes.

2157
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,399
She wrote a letter to each of us.

2158
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:28,319
And also,

2159
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,800
everyone's gift was different.

2160
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,680
She really likes you too, yes.

2161
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,880
She's a really good person.

2162
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,200
Yes.

2163
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,120
Actually, A-Jin is very thoughtful.

2164
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,680
Thank you, darling.

2165
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,319
Let me apologize to you.

2166
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,080
Because I couldn't write your letter.

2167
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,880
That's why he just sighed.

2168
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,080
I think that's what makes it special.

2169
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,720
That's right.

2170
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,120
She said she wrote a letter to everyone.

2171
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,080
But I didn't know

2172
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,600
what to say to you, Liu Yuning.

2173
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,640
I have a friend named Bai Yu.

2174
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,240
I'm speechless with you.

2175
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,960
Still telling jokes.

2176
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,240
No.

2177
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,920
I just understand why she couldn't write it.

2178
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,080
I understand.

2179
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,000
What about He?

2180
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,880
What about me? Do you like me?

2181
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,040
They put you last.

2182
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,640
That probably means they don't really like you.

2183
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,320
This one is just so-so.

2184
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,000
He.

2185
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,080
No, let me be honest with you.

2186
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,080
He and I are actually serious.

2187
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,720
No, we're all the same age.

2188
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,320
What do you mean, little brother?

2189
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,000
It was so warm just now.

2190
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,840
And you ruined it in an instant.

2191
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:40,720
I'm saying,

2192
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,040
For example, the difference between how I see those two and how I see him.

2193
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,080
It's actually right here.

2194
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,400
These two are really like older brothers.

2195
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,280
Yes.

2196
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,240
But when I look at him,

2197
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:47,880
it's just pure buddies.

2198
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,240
The kind you can just be bros with.

2199
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,200
I get it.

2200
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,600
Yeah.

2201
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,760
But whatever I say to you now,

2202
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,920
I don't even want to say it.

2203
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,800
Honestly.

2204
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,400
See, that's what bros are like.

2205
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,000
He doesn't want me to say it either.

2206
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,440
You know?

2207
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,840
He doesn't want me to say it either.

2208
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,440
Between men.

2209
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,080
Got it.

2210
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,120
Bro, I got it.

2211
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:01,560
As long as you get it.

2212
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,840
Got it, won't say more.

2213
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,480
It's all in the soup.

2214
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,040
It's all in the soup.

2215
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,800
A fan's wish.

2216
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,160
We could have the original cast do one.

2217
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,000
A spin-off variety show.

2218
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,600
That works, this could work.

2219
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,920
I think the best one is that.

2220
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,280
The spin-off variety show.

2221
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,840
Right.

2222
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,120
After that team-building day,

2223
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,200
we actually had this idea.

2224
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,720
Yeah, we said,

2225
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,840
should we go and record something like

2226
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,160
a team-building show,

2227
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,200
or maybe travel somewhere,

2228
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,440
just for fun.

2229
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,880
Then Bai Yu asked at the time,

2230
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,560
"Will we get paid?"

2231
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,520
No, just kidding.

2232
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,800
I was the one who asked.

2233
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,640
She was the one who asked.

2234
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,160
Anyway, if everyone

2235
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,520
has time and our schedules match,

2236
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,720
we could do something like that.

2237
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,600
Right?

2238
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,920
Yeah, let's see if

2239
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,320
our investors will support us.

2240
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,360
Polaroid.

2241
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,200
I'm the stand-in photographer.

2242
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,840
This is a drone.

2243
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,400
Phone.

2244
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,040
Open it on your phone.

2245
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,040
This is your lunch.

2246
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,720
I made a full Manchu-Han feast for you.

2247
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,120
What did you say?

2248
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,000
Carriage.

2249
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,320
The tastiest bread.

2250
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,560
This is delicious.

2251
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,320
It's really good.

2252
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,200
Let's have a toast.

2253
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:19,440
Cheers.

2254
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:19,920
Cheers.

2255
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:20,680
Cheers.

2256
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:20,880
Alright.

2257
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:21,680
Cheers.

2258
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,680
Why are you guys like this?

2259
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,760
I'm waiting here too.

2260
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,160
We can actually start a livestream anytime.

2261
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,360
If the six of us

2262
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,840
can find the time,

2263
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,360
seriously,

2264
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,880
if we ever really go to Ning's place one day,

2265
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,360
we can.

2266
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,880
Ning, would you welcome us to your place?

2267
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,280
Ning said he'd cook a whole table of dishes for us.

2268
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,080
That works too.

2269
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:50,600
Right?

2270
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,080
Sure.

2271
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,320
Yeah.

2272
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,360
Wait until I buy a house.

2273
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,280
I'm still six years away from being able to buy a house.

2274
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,760
You're not going to ask us to lend you money, are you?

2275
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,560
Better block him quickly.

2276
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,520
Danfa, are you there? Don't reply.

2277
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,640
I just want to send "are you there?"

2278
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,920
It's just about borrowing money.

2279
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,520
Alright, next,

2280
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,800
we're officially wrapping up.

2281
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,920
We've prepared some

2282
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,840
commemorative shirts for everyone.

2283
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,520
They're gifts for everyone.

2284
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,680
Pain shirts.

2285
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,080
Pain shirts.

2286
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,080
Who's this?

2287
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,200
Our emoji pack.

2288
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,280
It's on the shirt.

2289
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,320
What's this?

2290
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,480
This is hilarious.

2291
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,760
This is Bai Ge.

2292
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,040
There's one of Bai Yu.

2293
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,600
This is Ba's.

2294
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,160
Ba's sniper one.

2295
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,040
Sniper.

2296
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,560
Last season, they were all sweet snipers.

2297
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,480
This season, they're all deadly snipers.

2298
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,400
It's about hitting the target.

2299
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,560
Right.

2300
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,600
How do you shoot this?

2301
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,760
What's this?

2302
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,080
Why are you the same as me?

2303
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,440
Who am I?

2304
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,880
Who's your partner?

2305
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,280
Of course, I hope it's

2306
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,840
You look so classy.

2307
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:17,960
Put it on.

2308
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,560
Okay.

2309
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:20,680
Let's go.

2310
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,160
Wearing ours.

2311
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:22,600
Come on.

2312
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,240
Pain suit.

2313
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,240
(Come on) Players,

2314
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,840
let's start deducing.

2315
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:26,680
I think there's a song

2316
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,040
that will become our team's anthem this season.

2317
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,280
It's called "Auld Lang Syne."

2318
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,280
Yes.

2319
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,680
Let's hum "Auld Lang Syne"

2320
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,520
as we walk out, okay?

2321
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,320
Okay.

2322
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,640
Auld Lang Syne.

2323
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,920
Look at this

2324
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,040
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 4

2325
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,040
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 4

2326
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,800
Goodbye

2327
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,400
Goodbye

2328
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,440
Goodbye

2329
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,160
Isn't it through trouble that feelings develop?

2330
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,040
So none of you are good people.

2331
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,160
Don't blame me.

2332
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,280
No one is born an island.

2333
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,160
A Jin, A Jin.

2334
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,600
A Ba, A Ba.

2335
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,560
You even want to kill your father.

2336
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,240
I came to the human world just to have fun.

2337
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,280
And I want to grab a handful of balloons.

2338
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,600
Let's start by grabbing balloons.

2339
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,440
You can't do that.

2340
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,280
Why can't I pop it?

2341
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,080
Use more force.

2342
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,600
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 3

2343
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,680
We're here.

2344
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,440
One, two, three, four.

2345
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,320
Start!

2346
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,240
Why are you guys like this?

2347
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,400
Ba.

2348
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,880
Quick, grab the stuff!

2349
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,000
Don't hold it up, just ignore it.

2350
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Don't hold it up.

2351
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,920
Let's go.

2352
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,120
Here, your hand.

2353
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,400
It's okay.

2354
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,680
Run!

2355
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,640
I'm here, bro!

2356
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,720
Come on.

2357
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,080
We are...

2358
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,880
He Li, Mo, Jin Yu.

2359
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,960
Have you heard of us?

2360
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,640
Three, two, one.

2361
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,520
Go for it!

2362
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,360
A Jin.

2363
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,480
A Ba.

2364
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,880
Let's go.

2365
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,720
It's like going back to childhood.

2366
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,320
Reunion, reunion.

2367
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,120
Zhou Keyu

2368
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,080
Zhang Ling (He)

2369
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:32,560
Handsome.

2370
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,160
Come.

2371
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,120
Let's go.

2372
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:34,840
Go.

2373
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,440
Go away.

2374
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,160
All of us from Helimo Jinyu

2375
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,800
From this Helimo Jinyu group

2376
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,000
These friends

2377
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,200
are really great.

2378
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,200
They're truly good people.

2379
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,760
The five friends from our Kaitu group

2380
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,080
booked the whole place for me.

2381
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,480
And they didn't even tell me.

2382
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,600
None of them told me.

2383
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,200
Even the Kaitu production team

2384
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:52,920
didn't say anything to me.

2385
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,400
No one said, "Ning, I booked the place for you."

2386
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,640
He didn't even mention it.

2387
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,200
They did it for me quietly.

2388
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,520
At that moment, I was really moved.

2389
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,720
I was truly touched.

2390
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,920
I have to do my best.

2391
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,880
I can't let the Kaitu people lose face.

2392
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,520
Each of them sent me a private message.

2393
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,400
And encouraged me in the group chat.

2394
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,120
Each of them sent me a flower basket.

2395
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,000
If it weren't for saying that Dilraba's flowers were the prettiest

2396
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,680
and this one too.

2397
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,040
Thank you to the production team.

2398
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,520
Just now, I was in the group chat for the show.

2399
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,400
They wished me a happy birthday.

2400
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,400
Then I said I was going to do a livestream.

2401
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,600
Then Jin Jing said

2402
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,000
he would come and send me gifts.

2403
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,480
Then Bai Yu said he would

2404
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,520
He said he never watches livestreams,

2405
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,800
but he would still come and send me a dime.

2406
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,120
Tell me, where else can you find this kind of emotional support

2407
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,320
besides in the show’s group chat?

2408
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,640
Where else could you find it?

2409
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,520
Is being on the show fun?

2410
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,120
It is.

2411
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,320
But we’ve wrapped up filming.

2412
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,480
I really want to go back and record that show again.

2413
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,600
Even though it just ended not long ago.

2414
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,400
"Start Reasoning"

2415
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,200
See you in season four.
